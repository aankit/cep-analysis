The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that  meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school  can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to  provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including  all stakeholders.     The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program:     A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff,   community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity.  We must all be willing learners.     A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence.    Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school   community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal     Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school   environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members.     Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work.    The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over   the three year period of renewal.     The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy:   By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align  instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.   Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction,  school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school  culture.     The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy:  In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase  student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve  teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and  increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of  student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning  and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal  schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring  of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a  Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and  expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will  stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school  ready and able to learn.    School Receivership    In April 2015, state lawmakers and Governor Andrew Cuomo created section 211-f of the State Education Law, which  established the School Receivership program as a new intervention strategy to turn around struggling schools. This new  law, and Commissioner’s regulation 100.19, requires that “Persistently Struggling Schools,” defined as Priority Schools  that have been in the most severe accountability status since the 2006-07 school year, be given an initial one or two- year period under a “Superintendent Receiver”.  These schools were placed in receivership under the New York City  Schools Chancellor. Each school must make demonstrable improvement on specific benchmarks or it will be placed  under an independent receiver. Under the Chancellor’s Receivership Plan, the School Renewal Program is NYCDOE’s   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      5     core strategy for turning around struggling schools. Renewal Schools have already begun implementing significant  interventions and are receiving additional resources and support to accelerate student performance and help close  achievement gaps reflected in this RSCEP.    Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP)   The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for  each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great  Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools,  Strong Communities, including the following:     Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19   RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with  the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All  Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping  benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the  Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by  definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership  demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.      Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and   documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the  desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.      Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes   and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five  discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an  action plan.     Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental   health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school.     Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool      and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners.  Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and  instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding  to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students.    Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement.      Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      6     The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive  Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for  continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing  review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement  activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students.       Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.       The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      7     School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:   1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity  2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions  3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support  4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions  5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and  6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   I.  Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:         It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP.

Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools.     Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs   assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific,  Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor  progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school  community know when you have reached your goal.       Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement   Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections.     Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      9      Section 3: Community Engagement Team and School Leadership Team (SLT) Signature Page      Directions: All SLT members are expected to sign this page to confirm their participation in the development of this  Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP).

Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year.   Public School 85, also known as The Great Expectations School is situated in the Fordham-Tremont section of the  Bronx. The school is located a few blocks from the Fordham Shopping District, Metro-North and Fordham University’s  Rose-Hill Campus. The New York Botanical Gardens and The Bronx Zoo are within a half-mile of the school. Built in  1932, Public School 85 has an 85 year tradition of serving New York City’s immigrant and minority children. Currently,  nearly 900 families and 1,016 children make up The Great Expectations School’s student population with a staff of  highly qualified teachers.   In order to meet the diverse needs of our large student population, the school is organized into three small learning  communities called academies. Each academy is supervised by an Assistant Principal to ensure consistent support of  teaching and learning. Our Early Learning Academy serves the needs of students in Pre-Kindergarten, Kindergarten  and First grade. The Expectations Academy serves the needs of students in Second and Third grades. The Scholars  Academy serves the needs of students in Fourth and Fifth grades.    Public School 85’s vision is supported with strong partnerships led by our primary CBO Fordham University Graduate  School of Education. Turn Around for Children supports our efforts in school transformation by connecting our school  community to a variety of mental health services. New York Foundling Hospital also collaborates with parents and  staff to provide resources to support social and emotional needs of our students and families. The Montifiore School  Based Health Clinic provides a range of health services and is on-site. New York City Mission Society provides an Out  of School Time program for our children, after school and during school vacation times. Additional partnerships  include Mercy College Parent Center, Saint Barnabas Hospital, Wellness in the Schools, Police Athletic League, Literacy  Inc., Midori and Friends, and Ballet Tech.    Our school-wide curriculum incorporates the necessary instructional shifts in order to meet the demands of the  Common Core Learning Standards. All units of study are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards, in  conjunction with assessments and differentiated strategies to meet the needs of all learners including English  Language Learners, Students in Temporary Housing and Students with Disabilities. Our students also participate in a  range of academic and enrichment opportunities including science, technology, dance, chorus, art, multi-media, and  health/physical education. Many of these learning experiences are offered in specialty spaces such as: the Media  Learning Center, Science Lab, Auditorium, Gymnasium, Computer Lab and Dance Studio.       Public School 85 has implemented a Positive Behavioral Intervention Supports system called B.E.S.T. The B.E.S.T. of 85  is based on the belief that all staff members must model and actively/explicitly teach children both social and  academic behaviors aligned to the Behavior- Effort- Scholarship and Teamwork Framework. To support this effort, the  school is piloting a Social and Emotional curriculum in First and Second grades crafted to teach specific attributes that  support essential life skills.       2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      13      A school-based Teacher Center provides the base for professional learning and supports teacher development. The  Teacher Center consists of a variety of teacher resources, professional books, technology, and is supported by  instructional coaches, assessment coordinators, new teacher mentors and consultants. Data drives the Professional  Development using a Data Wise meeting protocol and Teacher Teams work together in order to plan for a year-long  professional learning agenda and calendar.    For the 2018-19 school year, there will be an expanded focus on the instruction of reading and mathematics, in  support of student learning across content areas, through direct/explicit instruction, targeted guided reading,  independent reading, Math talks and tasks and the development of student writing traits/craft. The school has  organized the day to build in additional supports in reading and math. This is reflected in the targeted professional  development of teachers and teacher teams using student data to make instructional shifts which impact student  achievement. The Instructional Focus for the 2018-19 school year states: If educators consistently engage students in  rigorous tasks across all content areas aligned to NYS Standards,that are supported by targeted feedback then  students will deepen critical thinking and communication skills which will result in increased proficiency for all  students in all content areas.   Our parents are our most significant partners in achieving our goals. P.S. 85 has established a school- based Parent  Center staffed by a parent coordinator in support of our families by providing guidance, workshops, resources, and  access to technology.   As a Renewal School, we will begin (and expand) the implementation of the following school improvement strategies  during this school year:   ● Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including five hours of additional instruction per week for all  students providing additional time for independent reading, small group instruction and computer assisted learning.  Teachers will enhance the daily instruction in English Language Arts by providing every students with structured  practice of foundational skill and applications.    ● Additional opportunities will be provided through our Lead Community Based organization for sports clubs, the arts,  mentoring for at risk students and tutoring.    ● Expanded services as a community school aimed at increasing student and family access to physical and mental  health services and other social-emotional supports available in or near the school community.   ● Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and instruction  aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) and to support staff in effectively responding to the  differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students including Students with disabilities and second  language learners.   ● Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement including: English as a Second Language  for parents, support for Families in Temporary Housing, Immigration and additional adult learning experiences.    We will also implement a School Renewal Plan based on a comprehensive needs assessment across all six elements of  The Framework for Great Schools (rigorous instruction, collaborative teachers, supportive environment, effective  school leadership, strong family-community ties, and trust). Although we have seen growth in the area of supportive  environment we continue to be challenged with collaborative teachers and trust. The goals identified in the RSCEP  support growth in these areas by increasing communication and opportunities for teacher collaboration using a  research based protocol. Our school has identified an Instructional focus which supports our goals and emphasizes  that students learn best when they are engaged in their own learning and are cognitively challenged.    VISION STATEMENT    2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      14         Public School 85 is committed to nurturing the intellectual, physical, social and    emotional development of all children and adults in our school.    Technology and the arts will support the differentiation of teaching and    learning within small learning communities.    Our school family, together with our neighbors will cooperate in maintaining a safe,    caring, respectful, and exciting school environment.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious  intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support)    Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice  Tenet 3 Statement of Practice   Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the  appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.  3.2   The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of  rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning  Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students.  Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction  (DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and  address student achievement needs.  The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner  within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the  arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities.  Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative  assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student  reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.   3.3   3.4   3.5   SOP(s)   Addressed   X               Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus:   1.  Summarize your school’s strengths relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs   selected above.   2.  Summarize your school’s needs relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs   selected above.  Identify the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section.   3.  4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   School Leaders collaborated with key stakeholders within the learning community and conducted a comprehensive  needs assessment which required analyzing multiple data sources including, School Integrated Intervention Team  Report, 2018 Survey Report, Quality Review, APPR visits, Advance, School Quality Reports, professional learning  feedback, and student data . While focusing on the Framework Element of Rigorous Instruction, the priority focus for  improvement is ensuring that teacher's are making curricular and pedagogical decisions based on formative and  summative data derived form student work, performance and common core aligned assessments. An increased  awareness and understanding of the alignment of assessments and the use of instructional strategies which are  consistently utilized across all classrooms across grade-levels will ensure students are engaged in rigorous tasks that are  closely aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. The higher-order tasks, which will consist of multiple entry  points, will be a collaborative process reflecting the instructional decisions derived from formative and summative  assessment data. The 2018 IIT recommendations included the use of regular teacher planning meetings targeted in  using data to inform strategies to group students and to transition them from one level to the next and monitor the  impact. An asset within the school community are the existing structures and routines including the school's Social and  Emotional Learning program (B.E.S.T.)which are in place that support rigorous instruction, however there is a lack of  consistency across classrooms evidenced in daily practices.        Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction   What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across  classrooms?     2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      18      The school’s Literacy Curriculum will be supported by the Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Units of study in  Grades K-5. The School’s Mathematics Curriculum will be supported by: Eureka Math resources, Engage New York,  Exemplars math tasks and best practices learned through Math Solutions. The school’s curriculum and units of study are  working documents that will require ongoing discussion and revisions by teachers and teacher teams. The process will  begin over the summer of 2018 and place greater emphasis on scaffolded tasks that lead to more challenging  work/work products and instructional shifts in teacher practice that will support and lead to increased student  achievement. The infusion of these scaffolded and more challenging tasks using the Ampilfy Science program and  Passport Social Studies resources will be evident throughout all units of study. Our Instructional Focus recognizes that if  educators consistently engage students in challenging complex tasks across all content areas aligned to the Common  Core Standards, and develop the critical thinking and communication skills in students, then the Public School 85  community will achieve proficiency in English Language Arts and Mathematics.    During the Renewal hour (Extended Learning Time) our students will engage in additional opportunities for independent  reading, letter writing and computer assisted instruction (I-Ready) in both ELA and Math. All classes will be led by  teachers and supported by tutors and mentors through Community Based Organizations. In support of our school’s  instructional focus a specific emphasis will be placed on content standards as well as CCLS for language supporting all  domains of Literacy development including reading, writing, listening and speaking.    Following the new NYC science and social studies scope and sequence there will also be time dedicated to revise units  of study. Although content area instruction will be integrated within ELA units and supported by Enrichment Teachers,  grade-level teachers and teacher teams will be expected to plan for explicit instruction in science and social studies. All  Enrichment Teachers will further support classroom instruction in content areas and have opportunities to  communicate with grade-level teams in order to do so. For example, the science Enrichment Teacher in collaboration  with grade four teachers will make decisions around which hands-on experiments will be conducted in the science lab  and/or outside of classroom instruction. Another example, the dance teacher will support grade three social studies  curriculum by engaging students in song and dance from communities around the world. English as New Language  teachers will provide services for students a minimum of 50% of the time within the student’s classroom in order to  ensure a connection across all subject areas.    Classroom libraries and resources in support of the units will support this work and continue to be enhanced, including  the Teacher's College classroom libraries. There will be a focus on including more high-interest books/texts, media  resources and leveled libraries/materials, in order to support units. Classroom environments will be organized for effort  and reflect a supportive child-centered environment. As a result, our beliefs of how students learn best will be more  transparent throughout classrooms. Teachers will closely monitor independent reading behaviors; ensuring students  are reading at appropriate text levels. This will ensure students are applying learning from their guided reading groups.  Independent reading will also be enriched to encourage students to read for enjoyment. Our beliefs reflect students  reading independently to practice skills and strategies targeted in guided reading lessons, in addition to pursuing the  love of reading. In Mathematics teachers will ensure that students are engaged in complex mathematical problem  solving tasks and that students are given the opportunity to engage in meaningful discourse as they share their thinking.    Differentiated instructional strategies and multiple entry points for all learners are built into units of study and  pedagogical practice. This includes additional supports and strategies for English Language Learners and Students with  Disabilities and emphasizes the use of technology, Thinking Maps, and increased opportunities for deeper student  discussion. The Kagan Cooperative Learning structures provide teachers with a tool to support student engagement  around tasks and discussion. Teachers and teacher teams will have clear learning targets based on assessment data  including conference notes. Conferencing will further support and continue to be instrumental in the teaching of  reading (guided and independent reading) and writing.    Our vision for rigorous instruction additionally includes a seamless instructional day, with specific attention to the Flow  of the Day and use of instructional time. We will provide an additional five hours of instruction a week for all students  and additional small group time for targeted academically at-risk students. School leaders, instructional coaches and  CBO staff will support teachers in maintaining consistency through coaching and providing clear, actionable feedback.  The development of teachers, teacher teams, and additional staff will be monitored and consist of accountability with   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      19      regard to feedback. There is a shared vision that teacher development will directly impact teacher practice and result in  student progress.   Student growth will be measured in a variety of ways. Progress will be monitored overall at three points in the year  from baseline to midline to end line, in all content areas. Throughout units of study, progress will be measured by  student work, portfolio reviews, DRA2, I-ready data and end of unit assessments. Teacher teams will have opportunities  to collect, organize, analyze, modify/revise units of study, and plan for daily instruction. There will also be assessment  data collected by teachers, facilitated and organized by the assessment coordinator, and analyzed by instructional  coaches and administrators to make revisions to grade-level and school-wide goals, in addition to tracking grade-level  and overall school progress. Our goal is for a minimum of 50% of our students to demonstrate measurable growth in  ELA and Math over the next year.          What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners,  personally, academically, and culturally?   A common core aligned curriculum requires that teachers understand the rigorous demands of the standards as well as  what students need to know, understand and do to be successful. In order to successfully implement a CCLS aligned  curriculum teachers must also be prepared to meet the diverse needs of their students, including students with  disabilities, second language learners, immigrants as well as academically successful students and increases cultural  awareness.          What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be  career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision?  A diverse program which supports all learners must be grounded in assessment which identifies the specific pathway  towards academic success. Practices which support career and college readiness are embedded in the instructional  shifts are opportunities to have multiple entry points, independent practice, guided practice, individual and group  conferences and opportunities to share their thinking while learning from other students.          What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?   The model for delivery of instruction will allow for differentiation, small group work and learning opportunities that  challenge thinking while respecting diverse needs of students and the unique talents of all learners.This vision includes  cultural sensitivity as well opportunities to learn about career opportunities and exposure to Institutions of Higher  Learning in our community.         How do you envision teachers using multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child?  Teachers can utilize multiple entry points when they are based on a combination of students choice and an  understanding of the learning needs and styles of each child, while also supporting the student to progress from where  they enter towards mastery of the standards and expectation. Learning targets, rubrics and checklist assist students to  self assess and motivate students to grow academically and personally.          What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and  summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes?  Teacher teams using a research based protocol will look at students work samples, conference and observational notes  as well as trends, patterns and progress monitoring to impact student outcomes throughout the school year. The use of  diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and summative data will guide curricular planning and instructional practices which  will be supported by professional development.     2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      20        Please indicate below the specific assessments that you are implementing and their purpose for each grade.

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   School Leaders collaborated with key stakeholders within the learning community and conducted a comprehensive  needs assessment which required analyzing multiple data sources including, School Review Report, Preliminary Survey  Report, Quality Review, APPR visits, Advance, School Quality Reports, professional learning feedback, and student data .  A strength reflected throughout the school community with regard to Framework Element Supportive Environment is  the high expectations in academic and social-emotional systems/behaviors that provide a safe learning environment for  all students. The NYC School Survey 2018 Report identifies increased consistency in teacher and parent responses and a  decreased gap between the school’s percentage of favorable responses and the average city percentage.

This is how we like everyone to describe our school community. The  expectations for CBO partners will focus on providing supports which meets the needs of parents and staff as well as  engage children in enriching activities which nurture the whole child. Student voice and leadership will be fostered by an  expansion of Student Government, clubs and student choice in activities. The school has developed a school wide  Positive Behavioral Support program B.E.S.T. (Behavior, Effort, Scholarship and Teamwork) and adopted a curriculum  that teaches and reinforces positive academic and social-emotional behaviors supporting effective teaching and  learning. The program also supports collaborative work and fosters self-esteem. Together with our CBO partners we will  expand our guidance services by providing a full time guidance counselor and supports to families and proactively  address social and emotional behaviors/skills. A system that tracks behavioral RTI includes support services and  enrichment activities in order to assist the school in identifying needs and the impact of interventions on social and  emotional development, academics and attendance. By increasing access to services for our families, including higher- risk families, we can address chronic absenteeism and improve lateness and attendance.

School Leaders collaborated with key stakeholders within the learning community and conducted a comprehensive  needs assessment which required analyzing multiple data sources including, Survey Report, Quality Review, APPR visits,  Advance, School Quality Reports, professional learning feedback, and student data . While focusing on the Framework  Element Collaborative Teachers a targeted need for teachers to maximize on opportunities for professional learning  during and outside of the school day with an average percentage of positive responses on the NYC School survey report.  There is a need to develop professional collaborations and trust to support a shared responsibility for student outcomes  based on the teacher environment survey.         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers   What is your vision for collaborative teaching?     To support teacher collaboration the school is organized into academies under the supervision of an Assistant Principal.  Grades K and 1 form the Early Learning Academy (in the Fall of 2015 they were joined by a new Pre-K), Grades 2 and 3  form the Expectations Academy and Grades 4 and 5 make up the Scholars Academy. These teacher’s schedules are  organized so that they have common planning time daily. Teachers who work across grades work together and form the  Building-wide Enrichment and Support Team (BEST). Teachers are encouraged to use this time to work together in  teams to collaborate on planning and review student work. In addition, during the Professional Development sessions  teachers have opportunities to work across grades depending on the needs of the professional staff.    Curriculum planning and unit development is grounded in Heidi Hayes Jacobs work in terms of what do children need to  KNOW, what do they need to UNDERSTAND and what do the need to DO to achieve the lesson’s Learning Target (Connie   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      32      Moss) and Guiding Questions are identified based on based on Norman Webb’s Depth of Knowledge. Assessments,  student work and the Common Core Learning Standards are used to shape the lessons and differentiate tiered  instruction and learning experiences, ensuring all students are being cognitively challenged. Expectations for procedures  and behaviors are modeled/taught, posted and referenced/reviewed. As our partnership is developed our community  educators will assist teacher in additional methods to scaffold as well as challenge learning for students.            How do you envision collaboration amongst your School Instructional Cabinet to improve teacher practices and  student learning?  The instructional cabinet meets weekly to share school wide updates and to look at trends in observations and teacher  in order to support cross-grade collaboration. The team also looks at student data sources, including student work  samples to monitor and support student growth.          How do you envision collaboration within teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?   Teacher teams meet weekly in both formal and informal sessions to look at student work and teacher artifacts that  support the student learning to plans and make shifts in teacher practices.          How do you envision collaboration across teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?   The Instructional Leadership team meets bi-weekly to share cross grade and specialty area practices and to support  teacher practice and student learning throughout the school. The Math Steering Committee is a cross grade team of  classroom teachers which meets weekly to support teachers in the implementation of the Mathematics CCLS. The  Science Steering Committee is a cross grade team of classroom teachers which meets weekly to support teachers in the  implementation of the new science curriculum supported by the Field Support center.      What data will teachers and the School Instructional Cabinet regularly review to ensure that they are reflecting upon  their teaching practices and meeting individual student learning needs?  What is the intent for reviewing each piece of  data? (ex. Teachers will regularly review student IEPs when developing lessons in order to ensure that tasks are  appropriately scaffolded.)

Part 2 – Summative Vision for Effective School Leadership   What is your vision for effective school leadership at your school?   As our Community school and Renewal school moves forward, the school’s current vision of the school will be embraced  by the entire school community as we close the gap between our current reality and our vision. Research, data and  results combined with best practices in teaching will foster a true “shared” vision. The principal together with our CBO  partner will strengthen our work towards nurturing the intellectual, physical, social and emotional development of all  children and adults in our school. Through grounding our work together through shared understandings, CBO partners  and school staff will be better able to meet and address the academic and social-emotional needs of our students.  Through progress monitoring and individual goal setting for students, the school community can build stronger student            38   2018-19 RSCEP-PF            intervention teams by measuring their impact and making connections with outside providers and Field Support Center  staff as needed. The current structure of the school, organized into academies under the direct supervision of a single  supervisor, supports and fosters the streaming across grades to meet student needs. The principal oversees all of the  management of the school’s fiscal resources in collaboration with The Field support center in order to ensure they are  aligned with the academic and social-emotional goals of the school. Observations based on the Danielson framework  are conducted across assigned grades by the grade level supervisor in order to maintain continuity. The principal reads  all observation reports prior to being returned to the teacher and makes suggestions for feedback and actionable next  steps. Additional observations are conducted in support of new and struggling teachers by the principal. Assistant  principals, in addition to grade level supervisors, have school wide responsibilities. Each supervisor is responsible to  coordinate the efforts of coaches and other Assistant Principals in one of the content areas of Literacy, Math and  Science, Social Studies. Professional Development to support the content is also coordinated by one supervisor. The role  of the community school director is to support all the initiatives in the school.      On which aspects of your own leadership do you plan to focus for the upcoming school year?  Teacher collaboration and distributive leadership      What is your vision for ensuring that everyone in your schools has a normed and shared understanding of the school’s  vision, mission, and instructional focus?   P.S. 85 has embraced the Data wise model and will continue to utilize "Meeting Wise" protocols to organize and  structure team meetings through out the school community.                      What is your vision for developing differentiated leadership throughout your school? How will you utilize teacher  leaders to build broad capacity within your school?

Part 2b. Describe how the school will meet the NYCDOE requirements for a Community School in the School Renewal  program.  1.   Renewal Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and together  with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will lead  implementation of the asset and needs  assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Renewal Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs  assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Renewal Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and families  feel welcome,  actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of their  schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this  family  engagement strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Renewal School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   2.   3.   4.   The Principal and School Leadership Team of P.S.85, The Great Expectations School, selected Fordham University's  Graduate School of Education (Graduate School of Education) as the lead organization in the proposed Community  Schools Program (CSP). The Center for Educational Partnerships (part of Fordham University's Graduate School of  Education will manage the CSP's day-to-day operation. The Director has been selected and possesses the expertise in  the administration and supervision of instructional programs at the secondary level. The role of the director includes  executing the implementation of the needs and asset assessment, and other critically important coordinating  activities. In addition the CSP director and team members will work closely with the school leadership, faculty,  support personnel, and parent coordinator to strategically plan, deliver and assess the initiatives, support/ referral  services and its impact on school culture, teacher effectiveness, and student achievement.   In an effort to improve student outcomes and engineer successful teaching and learning conditions during the school  day and extended learning time, both partners will work collaboratively at implementing a clear system for progress  monitoring by: (1) studying baseline data on all students’ progress and identifying which students require Tier 1, 2  and/or 3 interventions (2) determining the precise targets, level, skills and strategies that student require to develop  mastery. Fordham University will work closely with the DOE, DOHMH, school administrators, faculty and other service   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      53      providers on and off the campus in the joint delivery of all the mental health components, i.e., individually targeted,  selective and universal interventions. In addition to addressing the school community's mental health and social work  needs, the CSP will also provide a social and emotional development learning (SEDL) component aligned with State  Education Department guidelines. Including parents and caregivers where necessary, these activities will provide  adolescents with the various supports they need to develop into well adjusted, purposeful and productive members  of society. These supports (delivered directly or by referral) will include: individual, family and group counseling;  clinical social work interventions, in addition to stress management and life skills workshops. Fordham University is  confident that these activities will help to resolve some of the personal, familial and domestic issues which have  contributed to the achievement gap among students.   This component will be supported by a mental health professional hired by Fordham University in addition to a broad  consortium of community partners. These groups will include St. Barnabas Hospital, Puerto Rican Family Institute  (PRFI) and St. Rita's Immigration Services. The CSP will also offer services to support the physical health of P.S. 85’s  students and their families. To that end, Fordham University has already forged linkages with the Bronx Health Link  (TBHL), a coalition of local health care providers. Once each year, in collaboration with the administration, Parent  Coordinator and staff, the CSP will sponsor a Health and Wellness Fair at P.S.85. Families without medical insurance  will be informed about free and/or low-cost medical coverage, e.g., Medicaid in addition to New York State's Child  and Family Health Plus programs.   As a Partnership School, we are cognizant that family engagement is a key element of student success and parents are  the first teachers of their children. We understand the critical role parents play in their children’s education. The  intent of our family engagement program is to establish and sustain strong home-school-community partnerships  because we are convinced that it serves to reduce the gap that exists between the home and the school, thereby,  fostering a climate of partnership. Careful attention will be given to ensure there is a concerted focus on building  family engagement to encourage students to reach their maximum learning potential. Program activities will aim to  teach and empower families on how to navigate the school system, be effective advocates, share their insights and  ideas with schools and plan their very own learning journeys. In addition, parents will be encouraged to attend school  wide activities, parent - teacher conferences, monthly forums, continuing education programs, family counseling and  become part of the school decision making. Fordham University will work closely with the parent coordinator to build  on the existing programs offered. Some of the newer activities will include the following: ESL classes, parenting  classes, job readiness, workshops on instruction - common core standards and strategies that can be used at home. In  addition, a collection of resources and materials that parents and students can borrow to complete school  assignments and projects will be made available. School and CBO staff will continue to participate in web related  professional development to ensure effective use of the New Visions Data Sorter. Ongoing training will be provided  throughout the 2018-2019 school year.          Part 3 – Community School Program Implementation and Oversight   Part 3a. Key Staff and Partners  1.  Name and describe the scope of involvement of all community partners working in the school (include partners   supporting ELT, counseling, enrichment, etc.)   2.  Name the members of your Community School Team and how meetings will be organized and structured to   engage all stakeholders and be focused on results.   3.  Explain data strategies including the use of the data sorter, and steps that the school will take to ensure that the   appropriate interventions are provided to the right students   Fordham University's Center for Educational Partnerships will work closely with the DOE and all other key  stakeholders in the joint collection, compilation and analysis of CSP-related data. This activity shall be jointly managed  by the Community Schools Coordinator and the Center's Data Analysis Program Associate. The collection of program-  related data will begin with the CSP Implementation and Planning Phase. During that period, the CSC will carefully  document the creation of the Community School Team (CST). The anecdotal information compiled during this Phase  could be used (upon request from the DOE) to create a "Primer" which could benefit future CSP lead organizations.  Minutes from each CST meeting shall be placed in a Binder for subsequent review. At the end of each contract period,            54   2018-19 RSCEP-PF               these minutes will be analyzed to determine the impact this group had on the program's day-to-day operations.  Based upon these analyses, Fordham University will consider strategies for improving the CST's efficacy. The members  of the Community School Team are as follows:   Ted Husted, Dawn Johnson-Adams, Mary Doran, Shana Eutsay, Cesarina Javier, Mary Simone, Aracelis Lopez, Jeanette  Diaz, Tennyson Hurd, Susan Parks, Doris Comacho, Madelyn Acevedo, Ileana Figueroa, Melissa Chupko, Genny Garcia,  Aida Maldonado, Dr. Lynn Holden, Mark Williams, Sr. Margaret McDermott, Steve Alexander, Melissa Chupko.    As mentioned, parents and guardians play an important role in the success of the partnership in the CSP. To that end,  adult utilization of program services and level of involvement in the host school will be closely tracked by CSP staff.  Registration forms, attendance sheets and feedback will be maintained for each activity, e.g., parent  workshops/conferences, adult education programs, trips and other volunteer activity, etc., for which parents and  guardians choose to enroll. Fordham University will look very closely at the periodic customer satisfaction surveys  administered by the program. The input yielded by these documents will be used to drive the CSP's quality assurance  and continuous program improvement activities. Anecdotal feedback provided by P.S.85 Parent Association and  Parent Coordinator will also figure prominently in the project evaluation process. Student participation in all  expanded learning and enrichment activities will be reviewed monthly, to track utilization of these services. The CSP's  Expanded Learning Coordinator and Educational Specialist will take an active role in this portion of the project review  process. These staff will meet with P.S.85 staff on a regular basis to determine if student performance has improved  for students who participate in ELT activities. The progress reports, report card grades and standardized assessment  scores of these students will also be reviewed regularly by project staff.   With respect to the CSP’s mental health services, aggregate metrics for program utilization, e.g., number of new  intakes, individual and group counseling sessions, client referrals, etc., will be compiled for evaluation purposes.  Releasing and analyzing this data in aggregate form will protect client privacy around the mental health services they  have received. The effectiveness of this component will also be measured by the number of OORS incidents reported  by The Great Expectations School (P.S.85) over the course of each academic year.   The supportive resources that Fordham University brings into the school will be carefully analyzed. For example,  quantitative data will be maintained on: 1) total hours of asset building activities conducted by the CSC; 2) workshops  and other trainings offered; 3) asset building hours performed by the CSC; 4) new partners brought into the CSP  consortium; and, 5) material donations and volunteer hours secured by the program. The total dollar amount of  matching grants and contracts secured to support the CSP will also be documented. It is important to note that  Fordham University plans to utilize data collection strategies that have proven successful on CSP's across the nation.  These approaches are: 1) the Community School Evaluation Toolkit created by the Coalition for Community Schools  and, 2) the "Effective Data Collection and Sharing" guidelines articulated in "Scaling the Community Schools Strategy  in New York City."   Fordham University is providing the following key personnel: full-time Director–on site; full-time Mental Health  service provider; part-time Education Specialist and part-time Extended Day Coordinator, all of whom are school  based. The Director reports to Dr. Anita Vazquez Batisti, Fordham University Graduate School of Education, Associate  Dean and Director of the Center for Educational Partnerships.      Part 3b. Indicate resources needed including human resources, instructional resources, and schedule adjustments to  implement the Community School program.  The Community Schools Coordinator (CSC) will manage the program's day-to-day operation. This full-time employee  will be permanently stationed at P.S. 85 and will have his/her own office in the building. One of the main roles of the  CSC will be to serve as a liaison between all key stakeholders in the school community (e.g., students, parents,  teachers, principal and external partners), Fordham University and the Department of Education. In their managerial  capacity, this employee will assemble and preside over the Community Schools Team (CST) sub-committee of P.S. 85  School Leadership Team (SLT). Fordham University expects that the CSC will also be a sitting member of the building's  SLT as well and attend all meetings held by that group. Dual membership in those two bodies is essential since it will  provide the CSC with a complete, up-to-the-moment understanding of The Great Expectations School (PS 85) needs   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      55      and current status. The CSC will be expected to have regular (as in daily) dialogue with all constituents in the building.  To ensure that the needs of all families are met, the CSC will work closely with the Parent Coordinator and Parent  Association. Fordham University firmly believes that the process of asset building for sustainable development is    The Community School Program will begin July 2018 through June 2019.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (RSCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      64      achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      65      Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Public School 85, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.         The school will:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team/ Title  I Parent Committee, the Parent-Teacher Association.

We will be providing a Saturday  Title III supplemental program for ELLs that will target students whose proficiency level is  Expanding in language acquisition, as per the Spring 2017 NYSESLAT scores, in grades 2-5.   As per the RLAT, there are 71 students in grades 2-5 that scored expanding on the Spring 2017  NYSESLAT.  These students will be the target since they are very close to achieving  commanding on the NYSESLAT.  This program will be taught by 4 certified bilingual or ENL  teachers, one per grade.  The supplemental instruction will take place on Saturdays from 8:30am  until 12:30pm.  The projected starting date for this Saturday program is October 1, 2018 and will  continue until April 15, 2018.    The language of instruction will be English.  Our focus will be Reading/Writing and  Listening/Speaking. We will use Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT in grades 2-5 for our  supplemental Saturday program for ELLs. This program will help students and teachers stay  focused and true to the students academic and language needs as well as the details of the New  Language Arts Progression . The teacher-led lessons use a consistent, research-based, gradual- release model that helps students master language acquisition and concepts as they build  confidence. Within this program there is also embedded professional development in every  Teacher Resource Book—including step-by-step lesson plans and best-practice tips for ELLs and  SWDs.  The 4 classes will have access to the latest technology (e.g. smart boards, laptops, visualizers,  eno boards, etc.) and to a wide range of non-fiction books at different levels. Other related  literature will also be available for independent and guided practice.      Writing:  To differentiate our students’ writing needs and to enhance their writing skills:  Modeled writing (informational, narrative, etc) to give students the opportunity to be involved in  the writing process at their level as they grasp the new learning. It also gives them the  opportunity to articulate their learning and make sense of the writing process. The teacher also  models how to write in the different content areas within the writing workshop model.  Shared writing is based on assessments and students’ needs where the teacher and the  students  discuss, give opinions, and construct the text together. During the shared writing  discussion is encouraged and practiced between the students with other students and the teacher  as the text is being written and as the teacher is explaining the process of writing. Shared writing  allows students to practice their new writing skills during their independent writing.   Guided writing is based on the students’ needs. Here the students are  grouped according to their  writing needs in small groups where the teacher will explain the purpose for the writing and  model what s/he wants his/her students to learn. Students will be given the opportunity to discuss  and practice the new learning.   The teachers will also use Thinking Maps as a resource to differentiate instruction and to  enhance our English Language Learners’ knowledge of the writing and reading processes.   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      74         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Through a series of 8 maps, students are expected to learn language skills that would enhance  their critical, organizational, and analytical skills.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The assessment tools used to assess the early literacy skills of ELLs are Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA) for grades 3  to 5,  Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System for grades K to 2, TCRWP, I-Ready, Dibels and teacher created  assessments.  In grades K and 1 we also use Estrellita and El Sol for the bilingual class.  With El Sol we specifically use the  component that assesses beginning and ending sounds.  The DRA assessment is available to Spanish speaking students in  Spanish.  We are also using TCRWP and teacher-created assessments that are translated on a need basis.  These assessments help to inform the needs of the students and tailor instruction to fit the needs of the students.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      79         The structures in place is that the students are assessed periodically during the year.  K and First grade are assessed using  the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment system four times a year.  All other grades are assessed in Reading three times  a year.  Based on the results the students are grouped and serviced according to their reading ability.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The summative assessments that are used include Endline for Writing which we compare to their baseline and mid line  writing.  Also we give students a TCRWP reading assessment that is summative and assesses  comprehension.  Teachers also  provide Teacher created vocabulary assessments on a weekly basis on academic vocabulary that is taught throughout the  week.  Our students also engage in weekly conferences in writing and independent reading.  With Benchmark Reading  Assessments, teacher-created assessments, and through conferences we assess the success of our program as the students  make progress from one level to the next.    Based on these assessments, ELLs demonstrate and area of need in academic  vocabulary, figurative language in reading and writing.  They also show need in synthesizing texts.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    In our school, after teachers gather endline data we use the data to create small groups and to drive whole group  instruction.  Teachers on each grade meet in weekly data wise meetings to discuss commonalities and trends. Students that  are at risk receive RTI and some are a part of Reading Rescue to help improve fluency and comprehension.  Our students are  also conferred with weekly in writing and independent reading.  Using the Benchmark Reading assessment, teacher-created  assessments, and through conferences we monitor progress and assess the success of our program as the students make  progress from one level to the next.         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The data gathered is used to guide instruction by taking into consideration a number of factors.  We look at the number of  years of service in either the transitional bilingual or Freestanding English as a new language program.  We look at the four  modalities and other content areas to assess what the students are strong in and what needs more direct and targeted  instruction.   If the students skills are strong in their home language we use what they know in their home language to help  them  to acquire the new language (English).   The data helps us in identifying the students with inconsistent and and interrupted formal education and we can further  provide support not only in the content area but also provide them with socio-emotional support.  The data informs us what  setting would benefit the student as far as placement in a bilingual program.     ENL providers work closely with classroom teachers in a co-teaching model to strengthen the tier 1 instruction to best meet  the specific needs of Ells.  Tiers II interventions are provided to ells through small group instruction and differentiated  instruction.  (scaffolds such as but not limited to sentence stems, front loaded vocabulary and visuals) Tier III interventions are  provided for ells through targeted instruction outside of the classroom.                  6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The outcome assessments used to evaluate and inform ELL programs are NYSESLAT, and ELA and Math state exams.  We use  the EDAT to inform trends in proficiencies across the assessments and flag the students that are at risk.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?  Our ENL team is represented in the school's Instructional Leadership Team, where information from the ENL team is  shared throughout the rest of the school.  The ENL coordinator and administrators reviews student data available on the  EDAT and school wide data sorter and shares with teachers of ELLs and the ENL team.     2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      80           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented as   per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in one  class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Freestanding English as a New Language (ENL) programs provide instruction in English with home language support,  emphasizing English language acquisition. Students in freestanding ENL programs come from many different language  backgrounds, and English may be the only common language among the students. As per CR Part 154, there are 2 types  of ENL:  • Stand-alone ENL is instruction to develop English language skills so that students can succeed in core content courses. It  is delivered by a certified ENL teacher, usually in a small group.  A student may not receive stand-alone ENL in lieu of core  content area instruction.  • Integrated ENL is instruction to build English language skills through content area instruction. It is delivered by two  certified teachers (ENL and a content area) or co-teaching by a certified ENL teacher and a certified content area teacher  (i.e., English language arts, math, science, or social studies). Both methods of integrated ENL instruction include content  area subject matter and English language development using ENL strategies. All ELLs and former ELLs up to 2 years after  exiting ELL status must receive a minimum number of units of integrated ENL. In our school, instruction for ELLS  is  provided mostly through the integrated model where the classroom teacher and the ENL push in, collaborate and  provide instruction for the identified ELLS.  Students are grouped by their language proficiency level within their grade  and class.  The students are of heterogeneous proficiency level and differentiation occurs across the levels.   In order for  English Language Learners attending P.S. 85 to meet the high standards set for all students and to equally participate in  literacy, mathematics and other content areas, we provide each of our ELLs with coherent programs that are delivered  throughout the day. Our instruction is rigorous and it targets academic language, cognitive development and academic  and life skills. With this in mind, we provide our ELLs with - Integrated Model/Stand alone model and Transitional  Bilingual Education (TBE). The students are placed heterogeneously throughout the grades.  Depending on the needs of  the students they are provided with the required time as per proficiency in either a push in model or a small group pull  out.Our Integrated ENL Program provides instruction in English with native language support with an emphasis in English  language acquisition. The ENL teachers work with ELLs during content area instruction in collaboration with content area  teachers to provide language acquisition and vocabulary support while retaining content instruction time. The teachers in  this program use ENL methodologies and native language support as per the student’s New York State English as a  Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) scores. The English as a New Language teacher staff consists of four fully- licensed ENL teachers (Ms. Garcia, Mrs. Torres, Mrs. Llupa and  Mr. Cruz) who service students from grades K-5.  Students  in the integrated ENL receive minutes of instruction depending on their proficiency level.    As per their NYSESLAT score from the previous year, students in the Entering (EN) and Emerging (EM) levels receive 360  minutes of ENL instruction per week.  Students who are in the Transitioning (TR) and Expanding (EX) level receive 180  minutes of ENL instruction per week.  This year, as per the mandate students who scored Commanding(CM) also receive  90 minutes of ENL instruction for two years after exiting the ENL program.  The minutes of ENL instruction of our  students are determined by their performance on the NYSESLAT and for the newly enrolled students by the Home  Language Interview Survey (HLIS) and their proficiency level on the NYSITELL.  Integrated Models:In our integrated ENL model, the ENL teacher either, Ms. Garcia, Mrs. Torres, Mr. Cruz or Mrs. Llupa  works with ELLs in collaboration with the content area classroom teacher to provide language acquisition and vocabulary  support. There is a common preparation time between the 2 teachers and/or prior collaborative lesson planning. ENL  teacher comes into the classroom to service students for the mandated time as determined by their New York State  English as a Second Language Achievement Test scores (NYSESLAT) (90 minutes, 180 minutes or 360 minutes) during   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      81         content area instruction. The ENL teacher and the classroom teacher work together to plan and to make sure those  students are receiving support as they receive content area instruction (e.g. Social Studies, ELA, Science, Math, Arts). In  this model both teachers work in collaboration to provide language acquisition and vocabulary support while retaining  content instruction time. Models of Integrated ENL: You might see the ENL teacher and the classroom teacher involved in  any one of these models:1. Team-TeachingIn the team-teach model, the ENL teacher and the classroom teacher take  turns delivering lessons with the ENL teacher focusing on providing scaffolding and addressing more basic skills. The ENL  teacher also provides ideas and materials for differentiating and scaffolding classroom teacher written lessons. In this  model, the ENL teacher makes the content area material accessible to all learners. This is an extremely effective push-in  model. 2. Small-Group InstructionWithin this model, the ENL teacher pulls a small group during the independent work  time to reinforce or re-teach a skill. This is also a time to teach more basic language skills or grammar points. The best Big  Goal for this model is objective mastery and reading level. The small group lesson aligns to the classroom teacher’s lesson  if possible, but can also be aligned to a year-long plan that the ENL teacher may create based on ENL and ELA objectives  and standards. 3. One-on-One InstructionAnother way that the ENL teacher services his/her students is by sitting with  the students one-on-one to assess reading and writing skills during independent reading time or independent work time.  The skills the ENL teacher addresses during the one-on-one sessions are aligned to the classroom teacher’s curriculum  based on ENL and ELA objectives and standards.   Stand Alone ENLWe use the ENL Pull-out program to service students according to their level on the NYSESLAT, its four  components and grade level. The pull-out/freestanding model allows ENL students to sit most of the day in general  education classrooms and participate in differentiated instruction as per their needs. ENL students are taken out of their  classes as per their mandated time as determined by their scores on the four components of the NYSESLAT  (90 minutes,  180 minutes, 360 minutes) to receive ENL instruction in smaller class sizes with students of similar proficiency levels. The  ENL teacher aligns his or her teaching to the ELA/ENL standards so the students are receiving scaffold instruction that will  enable them to perform successfully in the general education classroom. ENL teachers also incorporate intensive  vocabulary and grammar instruction to enable them access to academic content. The ENL teacher works closely with  classroom teachers to ensure that the students are being taught according to the common core standards and that  important content is not missed as they are being pulled out.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Instruction for ELLS in the TBE program is also based on proficiency level and consists of three parts.  The students are  provided with ENL, Native Language instruction based on level of student proficiency and the teacher chooses two  subjects(generally Math, Science and or Social Studies) for entering and emerging students. For students with a  proficiency level higher than transitioning, the content area they receive native language instruction is Math.   In general the objectives of a transitional Bilingual program are to facilitate language and academic development using  the native language to foster English as a new language.  Instructional time is primarily done in the home language before  transitioning to instruction in English.   At the beginning/entering level, TBE students are expected to receive 75% of  instruction in their home language and 25% in English. As a student’s English proficiency increases, more of the  instruction is done, learning in English. In our TBE programs, the teachers make careful consideration when determining  which language to use for instruction.  Teachers differentiate by taking into consideration which language would best fit  with the students knowledge of the concept and the students familiarity with the subject.  As per CR Part 154, there are 2  types of ENL, Stand- Alone and Integrated ENL.   • Stand-alone ENL is instruction to develop English language skills so that  students can succeed in core content courses. It is delivered by a certified ENL teacher. A student may not receive stand- alone ENL in lieu of core content area instruction. • Integrated ENL is instruction to build English language skills through  content area instruction. It is delivered by a dually certified teacher (ENL and a content area) or co-teaching by a certified  ENL teacher and a certified content area teacher (i.e., English language arts, math, science, or social studies). Both  methods of integrated ENL instruction include content area subject matter and English language development using ENL  strategies. All ELLs and former ELLs up to 2 years after exiting ELL status must receive a minimum number of units of  integrated ENL.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      82      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?         Grades K-5 are grouped according to their most recent proficiency level on either the NYSESLAT or NYSITELL scores.  The  allocation for instructional time is determined by the Scale Score Ranges for determining English Proficiency. If a students  proficiency level is entering or emerging they receive a total of 360 minutes of ENL instruction.  Students who score transitioning  or expanding receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction.  Students who scored commanding receive 90 minutes of ENL support for  two years.  Our experienced ENL teachers service grades K-1, 2-3, and 4-5 respectively. Our goal is to move our ELL students one  proficiency level every year so that English proficiency is reached within three years.There is close collaboration between the ENL  teachers and the monolingual teachers of ELLs.   Both teachers collaborate and co-teach in an integrated model.  Students are  serviced through an integrated model and stand alone is provided to those entering and emerging students requiring 360 minutes  of ENL.  The classroom teachers are notified about the test results and about students who become proficient and that they will  continue to receive support services for three years after they have become proficient.  For these students, we create a smooth  transition for them to become fully immersed in a mainstreamed class and continue to support them after proficiency is acquired  through accommodations and differentiation of the lessons in the content areas.   Students who scored commanding are still  provided 90 minutes of ENL instruction as support for two years after being proficient.    Spanish-English Transitional Bilingual ProgramIn our Spanish-English Bilingual Transitional Education program students in  TBE receive high-standards and quality instruction in the students’ native language as they learn English in all content  areas.  Instruction in English increases as these students’ English proficiency increases. In this program, students who are at a  beginning level of language proficiency receive 60% of their instruction in their native language in all content areas and 40 % in  English with a minimum of 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week. At the intermediate level, students receive 50% of instruction  in their native language and 50% in English with a minimum of 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week. Students in the advanced  level of proficiency receive 25% of instruction in their native language and 75% in English with a minimum of 180 minutes of ELA  instruction per week and 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week. These students receive enl and native language support in all  of the content areas (e.g. science, social studies, mathematics). Lessons are differentiated according to our students' language and  academic levels and needs. Teacher of TBE and ENL make sure that guidelines are followed when planning for mathematics, social  studies, science, reading, writing. The needs of all of our students are determined by how they perform on the NYSESLAT, DRA,  baselines, individual conferencing and for the newly enrolled students by the HLIS and the NYSITELL and or Spanish Lab.One of the  many goals of the ENL and Transitional Bilingual programs at P.S. 85 is to provide all English Language Learners with the  opportunity to develop their academic language in all content areas through listening, speaking, reading and writing skills and this  will help them to become life-long learners and to function in both English and their native language. Instruction: ELLs receive  instruction in their native language and in the second language as per DOE recommendations (OELL). Our students receive  instruction in two languages - the language spoken at home and in English. In the beginning stages of English acquisition, 60% of  the instruction is provided in the student's native language and 40% in English and as the student develops fluency in English,  instructional time in English in all of the content areas will also increase. Below are the schedules we follow to instruct our ELLs in  all of the content areas.LEP students with disabilities whose IEP recommends ENL or bilingual instruction English Language  Learners who are receiving special education services and who are in either bilingual or ENL programs are grouped and taught in  all content areas according to guidelines, learning needs, and NYSESLAT/NYSITELL scores. At P.S. 85 our ELLs with disabilities are  provided with ENL services or Transitional Bilingual Education and if the parents prefer a dual language program, we provide them  with the information needed to put in place a transfer.  Students who are receiving ENL instruction are grouped for instruction  according to their scores on the NYSESLAT in the four different components and receive instruction in English in the content areas  using ENL methodologies for the specific amount of time as determined by their NYSESLAT scores. In the Transitional Bilingual  program students are taught standards-based subject matter instruction in the students’ native language with support with ENL  methodology and as per the mandated time. There are four experienced ENL teachers providing push in ENL as per mandated  guidelines. During this time, the ENL teacher works with the ELL students in content instruction in collaboration with the regular  classroom teacher to provide language acquisition and vocabulary support while retaining content instruction time.            3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and methods   used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core Learning  Standards.    2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      83         To support students in meeting the Common Core State Standards (CCSS), the ENL teacher, provides content area instruction.  In  the event that this instruction may not be done in the classroom in an integrated model, then the ENL teacher schedules a stand  alone instruction group using ENL strategies to support the students language abilities based on the classroom teacher's  lesson.  The ENL teachers employ a Content Based ENL Approach to teaching ENL, using various methods for comprehensible  input and techniques to support output, in Common Core State Standards-aligned units of study.  Common planning from  professional development in conjunction with planning between the content area teacher and the ENL teacher ensure that core  content is delivered.  The ENL instruction is provided in English.   We provide content-area instruction in English using ENL  methodology and instructional strategies, as well as using native language support to make content comprehensible. Instruction  incorporates ENL strategic instruction using problem solving, picture symbols (Mayer Johnson), speech assistance devices,  challenging content, project-based and communicative-based learning. CCLS techniques focus on modeling, bridging,  contextualizing, text assessment and understanding, and using content to analyze and answer questions effectively. ENL teachers  use the same content taught in the classroom working with CCLS curriculum however incorporate ENL strategies to facilitate  learning for the ELL. For standardized assessment students, Go Math,  Teacher's College Writing Performance Assessment and  CCLS Teacher-created tests are utilized for instruction and evaluation of student needs. Our program is designed to assist ELLs in  achieving proficiency for their grade and meet or exceed New York State standards. All staff working with ELL students (teachers,  paraprofessionals, and related service providers) attend ongoing professional development workshops on ELL student  achievement over the academic year.  In Bilingual classes, newcomers and any student who needs the support in Grades 3  through 5 receive CCSS-aligned Math materials in Spanish, students receive Math instruction in English and/ or in Spanish as  determined by proficiency level.  Bilingual classroom teachers teach content areas differently in terms of language allocation,  depending on the model and proficiency level.  In Transitional Bilingual Education, the students learn in CCSS-aligned units for all K  classes, with lessons developing concepts and proceeding through the units with repetition and translation of content as  needed.  According to the unit of study, concepts and skills are built sequentially using the language of instruction as a vehicle to  progress through the unit.  Among second language approaches or methods teachers may use in any program are the Content  Based Method, the Natural Language Approach, Total Physical Response, Language Experience Approach, and the Direct  Method.  Teaching methods may include Cooperative learning, project based ENL, thematic units.  Some techniques which are  encouraged are the use of modeled oral language and student dialogue and academic conversational routines, and other speaking  and listening routines, common in general education, such as turn-and-talk, but with explicit teacher support to help students  speak and focus for listening and speaking.     Language and Content objectives are used in planning lessons, including ENL  lessons.  Language acquisition and learning strategies are used by all teachers of ELLs to facilitate learning, in all grades.  As  students reach grades 3-5, and are more metalinguistic and metacognitive they are supported to learn about strategies they may  make choices to use of to acquire language or learn in the second language.   The use of multiple modalities for teaching language  and content is encouraged and modeled to improve teaching through learning styles, particularly for, but not limited to, students  who are ELLs with Special Needs.  ENL teachers scaffold lessons orally and in written form to assist students at different L2 stages  and levels.  Classroom libraries are equipped with appropriate ENL literature and students who speak Spanish and also have the  ability to read and write in Spanish can borrow books from the Spanish language libraries.  Students in upper grades who arrive in  the school with literacy in Spanish are supported to use L1 for writing, as a bridge for learning writing process as they acquire  writing abilities in English.  These choices depend on many factors, including student needs data showing where each student’s  greatest needs may be.   native language and 40% in English and as the student develops fluency in English, instructional time in  English in all of the content areas will also increase. Below are the schedules we follow to instruct our ELLs in all of the content  areas.LEP students with disabilities whose IEP recommends ENL or bilingual instruction English Language Learners who are  receiving special education services and who are in either bilingual or ENL programs are grouped and taught in all content areas  according to guidelines, learning needs, and NYSESLAT/NYSITELL scores. At P.S. 85 our ELLs with disabilities are provided with ENL  services or Transitional Bilingual Education and if the parents prefer a dual language program, we provide them with the  information needed to put in place a transfer.  Students who are receiving ENL instruction are grouped for instruction according  to their scores on the NYSESLAT in the four different components and receive instruction in English in the content areas using ENL  methodologies for the specific amount of time as determined by their NYSESLAT scores. In the Transitional Bilingual program  students are taught standards-based subject matter instruction in the students’ native language with support with ENL  methodology and as per the mandated time. There are four experienced ENL teachers providing push in ENL as per mandated  guidelines. During this time, the ENL teacher works with the ELL students in content instruction in collaboration with the regular  classroom teacher to provide language acquisition and vocabulary support while retaining content instruction time.       2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      84      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?    To ensure that our ELLs are evaluated appropriately in their native language throughout the year we use screeners, formative and  summative assessments, as well as Teacher-made assessments as per standards and content area, ELE, SP-Lab, and DRA are  available and administered in Spanish. Translators are used during assessments for students who speak other languages than  English and Spanish as needed.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    At P. S. 85 we are using research-based programs to address the academic and language needs of our ELLs. The main focus of  these programs is to differentiate instruction for English Language Learners and SIFE. These programs are Intervention by Design  By Rigby. Another program that we use is Estrellita which emphasis is on phonemic awareness in Spanish - it is multisensory  instruction in phonemic awareness, phonics, and fluency. It is sequential, cumulative, structured, systematic, and differentiated  direct instruction. It is a continuous diagnostic assessment that informs instruction.  To enhance the language acquisition for all  ELLs and to enhance understanding and comprehension.  SIFE students receive daily specific and differentiated guided and one- on-one instruction for 30 minutes during our intervention period. During this 30 minutes students are either involved in  independent reading using the Fountas & Pinnell leveling system that aligns with the DRA or in a conference with the  teacher.  Students are involved in individual conferences with the teacher or are working in very small (no more than 3 students)  strategy groups with the teacher sometimes in their native language.During the readers and the writers’ workshop (90 minutes)  these students also receive guided instruction following the workshop model. During this time students are involved in highly  organized activities that target the standards for ELA and ENL. The lessons for these students are differentiated according to their  very specific learning needs throughout the day and in all content areas (Math, Science, Social Studies, etc.).     Plan for  Newcomers:We make sure that teachers (Bilingual, ENL and Monolingual Teachers) are well trained and experienced with ENL  strategies and methodology and knowledgeable about second language acquisition. To ensure this, we have developed an ELL  handbook which has been distributed to all teachers at P.S. 85. This handbook was distributed and explained during an ELL  workshop at the beginning of the year. There have also been follow-up workshops.   •Identify the family literacy level and make family members (siblings also) aware of how the system works and where the  resources are to get help (school library, public library, Dial-A-Teacher in Spanish, parent coordinator, during school community  meetings and assemblies, PTA meetings).•Use the first language score (where available) to differentiate our teaching.•Interview  parents when they register the child: ask specific questions about the education system in the native country and how did the  child do (if he went to school there). Parents are also invited to one-on-one meeting with the assistant principal when students  are being registered or attending school for the first time.•Administration of the Home Language Survey.•Analyze student  profiles.•Differentiated instruction and effective teaching strategies for ELLs.•Collaboration and planning between ENL and  content area teachers.•Clear understanding of the students’ linguistic and cultural backgrounds.•Clear understanding of the  student background knowledge and frame of reference and life experience.      Open houses are also offered to parents. Long Term ELLsStudents with interrupted formal education and who have been  identified as long-term ELLs are provided with extra programs such as after school programs, intervention and differentiated  instruction, differentiated language learning instruction and extra small group and individual/academic support. The programs for  these students are tailored to their specific language learning needs and life needs. These programs are designed to strengthen  their listening, speaking, writing and reading skills. These programs are taught by licensed bilingual and ENL teachers.  Plan for  Alternative Placement in Special Education•Give students enough time and effective support to develop socially and  linguistically.•Carefully analyze students’ profile and evaluation (if necessary) to determine that lack of proper progress is the  result of any disability and not lack of language development•Have meeting (school team) to determine the student’s level of  proficiency (bilingual teacher, ENL teacher, Sp. Ed. Teacher, parent coordinator, School Support Team)•Notify parents and show  them a concrete work plan for the student to receive the best support in the Sp. Ed. Class (with ESL or Bilingual services)•Follow  IEP recommendations as needed Transition Plan for Students Reaching Proficiency level of Commanding•Notify the parent of the  success and give supporting documents.•Notify the classroom teacher and give supporting documents.•Give extra support (two  years) through ENL services to ensure that the transitional period is a smooth and encouraging one. •Ensure a socially   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      85      comfortable environment for them (especially those who move from bilingual classes into monolingual ones)  •Provide with  accommodations/support, which include at least 90 minutes of instruction per week after acquiring commanding proficiency level  on the NYSESLAT    ELLs and former ELLs are given time and a half for testing accomodation during the school year and  standardized testing.  If a student requires tests in another language other than english they are given that option in science and  math.  After a student attains a proficiency level of Commanding, they are provided support and ENL instruction for up to two  years as per CR Part 154.2.  Former ELLs receive at least one half of one unit of study of English as a new language (90 minutes per  week) and are eligible for certain specified testing accommodations as mentioned above.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic content   areas and accelerate English language development?   Grade level materials for ELL-SWDs include MyOn, I-Ready and designated Spanish-English libraries.   During instruction, teachers  take into account the primary language and culture of the student while giving consideration to and teaching to the cognitive  ability of the child. Units of instruction and methodologies vary based on the student’s cognitive ability and his/her level of English  proficiency. Some units of ENL instruction offer instruction in understanding, reading, writing, speaking English while others utilize  ENL methodologies to develop and grow cognitive skills. CCLS plays an important role in developing the intellectual capacity of our  students. The relationship of questions and answers with supporting evidence is an important enhancement to our instructional  techniques.  Students are supplied with materials and grade level books in all of the content areas in both English and Spanish and  materials translated in other languages as necessary (e.g. S.S., Science, Math, Literature, etc.). We also use Thinking Maps - a  Language for Learning, which is a resource used to reinforce and enhance comprehension in our ENL, special education and  bilingual classes. Thinking Maps is a program that was developed by David Hyerle and Chris Yeager that supports and facilitates  the development of language and thinking processes. It engages, as well, our ELLs with disabilities in critical and analytical thinking  while supporting their specific learning needs.We are also placing a lot of emphasis on academic language development and  planning for instruction.  All of our instruction in all content areas are highly conceptual, linguistically appropriate, and  intellectually and analytically demanding. We strive to develop cognition, higher order thinking skills and use the depth of  knowledge to plan questions and to develop academic language. Our instruction is highly contextualized and our activities and  differentiated approach to support all ELLs regardless of their academic level and language acquisition, are carefully planned,  evaluated and analyzed to enhance and enrich our students' comprehension and understanding of content. When available,  leveled  content literature is provided to the students who are ELLs-SWD.  Teachers of ELLs-SWD use total physical response,  visual aids, sentence stems to accelerate the English Language Acquisition.  The teachers read and are a part of the conference  that addresses the needs of the ells in the IEP and plan accordingly to ensure that the services that are mandated are  provided.  Students have access to ipads, computers and laptops where they can access I-Ready, MyOn, Imagine Learning, Starfall,  Lexia  and Brain Pop to facilitate instruction and accelerate English acquisition.  In addition, all classrooms are equipped with an  ENO board that is used in instruction of ELLs-SWD.  Native language materials used are DRAs, El Sol, Dibels and Estrellita.  Students  who need it, have access to books in Spanish and English with a designated language library in the classroom.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  English Language Learners who are receiving special education services and who are in either bilingual or ENL programs are  grouped and taught in all content areas according to guidelines, learning needs, and NYSESLAT/NYSITELL scores, and IEPs.   At P.S.  85 our ELLs with disabilities are provided with ENL services or transitional bilingual education.  Students who are receiving ENL  instruction are grouped for instruction according to their scores on the NYSESLAT in the four different components and receive  instruction in English in the content areas using ENL methodologies for the specific amount of time as determined by their  NYSESLAT scores. There are four experienced ENL teachers providing push in ENL as per mandated guidelines to monolingual  classes as needed. During this time, the ENL teacher works with the ELL students in content instruction in collaboration with the  regular/special education classroom teacher to provide language acquisition and vocabulary support while retaining content  instruction time.  In the transitional bilingual program offered, students are taught standards-based subject matter in the  students’ native language (spanish) with support and ENL methodology and as per the mandated time. At P.S. 85 we implement  the following guidelines to address the language needs of our ELLs in all content  areas:                                        Entering/Emerging                             Transitioning                               Expanding                 CommandingENL  instruction for all ELLs                360 min. per week               180 min. per week                180 min. per week         90 min. per  week  ELLs with IEPs also participate in our 30 minutes of daily intervention support by the classroom and a push in teacher.   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      86      During this time, these students are highly engaged in independent reading, conferencing one-on-one with the teacher and  participating in targeted-small group instruction. These students also receive instruction as per their language and academic  needs during our extended time (50 minutes twice a week).     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our intervention instructional strategies are tailored to meet our student needs. Instruction is provided in English and the Native  Language (spanish) when needed in ELA, Math, and other content areas. The alternate placement paraprofessional under the  guidance, supervision, and direction of the teacher, provides native language instruction and translation of the common core  curriculum topics as needed. Intervention instruction encompasses visuals, listening centers, modeling, contextualizing, and the  latest common core curriculum standards. ENL teacher(s) and Bilingual teachers use the same texts employed in the classrooms.  Our students use Teachers College Writing Curriculum.  The ENL teacher(s) incorporate real life situations and equate that to the  learning experience.  Support services to LEP students: Other support services:In addition to the mandated services that our  students receive in both the second language and the native language, we have set in place other intervention programs. We are  providing our students with differentiated, individual and small-group tutoring within the classroom as push in when the content  areas are being taught (e.g. Literature during the readers and the writers' workshops, Science, S.S., Math). Groups are separated  or differentiated according to their academic/language levels in the content area, academic level and language  acquisition/dominance levels. The programs provided to ELLs are specifically designed for the ELL population and target four  major components: reading, writing, speaking and listening. The students in these programs are  grouped according to their  performance on the NYSESLAT and as per formative and summative assessments on reading, writing, listening and speaking in all  content areas and the lessons are developed rigorously by highly qualified and fully certified teachers. All of our programs include  special education students, long term ELLs and SIFE.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the upcoming school year we will continue to support all of our ELLs in the content areas through push-in/freestanding ENL,  NL support, TBE and improve our AIS/intervention services and SETSS for bilingual ELLs.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No programs/services at P.S. 85 will be discontinued.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  At P.S. 85 we ensure equity in technology and instructional resources by providing equal access to computers, instructional  technology, and other materials, such as books, text books in the content areas, that support native language and English  language literacy development. All of our ELLs have access to our technology. All academies at P.S. 85 have a technology teacher  and computers/laptops units to make sure that all students receive technology support. To service our ELLs we also have listening  centers and this includes the Imagine Learning program.At this time, we are offering our students support with our renewal hour  before and after school five times a week.  This program addresses English Language Arts.  Letters are sent home requiring all  students to attend.  At PS 85 all of our students have access to the programs offered.   NYC Mission Society is also a service that is  provided to all students which provides homework help, recreational activities and STEM instruction.  ELLs are offered the  opportunity of equal access to all school programs. ENL teacher(s) at our school collaborate and team teach with both classroom  and science enrichment teachers. When available, ELLs will be able to attend both Title III and After School programs. These extra  programs offer a reinforcement to the daily instructional program and also serve as a social learning tool for collaboration and  understanding among students.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Due to the individual needs of our students teachers utilize a variety of instructional strategies and materials. Teacher(s) provide  instruction in ENL and content area instruction in English is supported by ENL methodologies. During instruction, teachers take  into account the primary language and culture of the student while giving consideration to and teaching to the cognitive ability of   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      87      the child. Instruction and methodologies vary based on the student's cognitive ability and his/her level of English proficiency.  Some units of instruction in ENL provide instruction in understanding , reading, writing, listening, and speaking English while  others utilize ENL methodologies that develop cognitive skills. For some students ENL uses visuals, listening centers, and total  physical response. The ENL teacher(s) use a variety of books, workbooks, magazines, and visual cues that help our ELLs learn  different subject matter. These materials are Common Core Curriculum based and enhance and foster positive learning  outcomes. All ELLs have access to classroom libraries and grade level curriculum materials, just as non-ELLs do.  Specialized ENL  materials are available and teachers may access these as needed.  Materials, mostly for literacy development in ENL include Rigby  Guided Reading for ELLs, and NYSESLAT and Beyond. All ELLs have access to all technology in the building.  This technology  includes laptop computers, Smart Boards, and iPads.Other technology/instructional supports our ELLs have access to and which  are incorporated in their instruction in both the NL and ENL include: Smart tables in all special education classes; interactive  whiteboards in all classrooms; laptop units are available in every classroom, IPADS are also being used in the instruction of ELLs  and to support the instruction of content areas and the curriculum. ELLs also have access to eno boards, digital cameras, LCD,  IPODS, and safari montage.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is delivered in ENL and TBE in all content areas through dictionaries which are available in  Spanish.  Library which are designated in both Spanish and English.  Translations in Science and Math are available in  Spanish.  Technology is available to aid students in a accessing content through visuals and ELL supported websites.  We also use  the recommended language schedule for TBE from OELL. depending on proficiency level.  Teachers provide bilingual charts and  word walls in TBE classrooms and content may be taught in native language as needed.  In ENL, students who may speak the same  language as an entering or emerging student are paired to provide support for the respective student.  The use of visuals and total  physical response also helps in supporting the home language while delivering instruction.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The required services support and resources offered correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels by ensuring that all services are  provided by teachers certified for the grades.  We ensure that materials used are matched to the grades and academic/language  needs of the students, including in any class where students are multiple grades/age ranges.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the ELLs’   needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our school does not share a building.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for new  ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, parent  coordinator).   The activities in our school that assist newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school year are limited since we  have a limited amount of Title III funding to offer students a summer program.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    There are no language electives offered to ELLs at our school.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same time  (simultaneous)?   N/A        2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      88      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All staff members at P.S. 85x including Assistant Principals, Subject Area Teachers, Paraprofessionals, ENL Teachers, Guidance  Counselors, Special Education Teachers, Psychologists, Occupational Therapists, Physical Therapists, and the Parent  Coordinator, attend on-going professional development courses to assist in the instruction of our ELL students. Professional  development will include but is not limited to the following: Focus on the Common Core Curriculum under the leadership the  school’s coach and district direction; concentration on Academic Oral Language and Vocabulary Instruction in Language  Learning; and an opportunity for language development.    Professional development is provided weekly for all teachers (including ENL teachers) and is delivered in cycles with a focus on  delivering quality instruction to all students. All professional learning includes strategies which support English language  learners since there are language acquisition needs in all classes. Professional learning is facilitated by in-house staff (ENL  teachers, Administrators, Instructional Coaches) and includes all professionals in a shared responsibility for learning.     Specific professional development is provided  to Bilingual and ENL teachers in addressing the Common core standards with an  additional focus on the Language standards for each grade. This professional development is delivered by the ENL coordinator  Joanny Garcia and our Instructional Coach Jeannete Diaz.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Professional development for bilingual and ENL teachers is provided through Fordham University Graduate School of Education  by Ms. Gonzalez, literacy consultant, who works directly with bilingual teachers visiting their classrooms and providing  feedback.  She is in the classroom two to three times a week.  These coaching sessions and professional development sessions  are monitored by school administrators through agendas and coaching logs of assistance.  At this time K-2 teachers are being  provided with professional development for a six week period by Maria Guerrero, ELL services Administrator from the Bronx  Field Support Center.  The focus is providing scaffolds for Ells.             Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   To facilitate and ensure academic excellence for all ELLs, parents of ELLs are regularly informed through Spanish and English  monthly calendars, newsletters, meetings, and workshops as to new developments concerning our English Language Learners  and all students. All teachers of English Language learners conduct weekly sessions with parents during the Tuesday afternoon  Parent Engagement time. Annual parent meetings are held in September (9/13/2017) and May (5/23/2018). Every effort is  made to communicate and assist parents throughout the school year and to do this we have personnel providing services to  our ELLs, regular students and their families.  Translation services are provided as needed by contacting the office of  translation and interpretation unit.      We have a bilingual related services social worker, a bilingual family engagement coach in grades K-2, other personnel who  speak French and Albanian and other related services as well as a bilingual parent coordinator who is actively involved in our  community and assessing the needs of our community. The School Leadership Team and Parent-Teacher Association are also  very involved in the life of the school and our school community in general. They hold monthly meetings. During these  meetings parents are informed and updated about school/community related issues and updates on mandates.  If needed, we  would contact the Translation and Interpretation unit for speakers of other languages not available.         2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      89         ELL parents are always included in school wide events.   Parents are always invited to these community meetings where we  discuss and showcase our students' progress both academically, creatively and artistically. Our Parent Coordinator ensures  that all events are translated into spanish by using a communication device that allows parents to hear the translation through  headphones as it takes place. Our Parent Coordinator also works with outside organizations such as Wellness in the Schools,  Institute for Family Health, Mission Society to coordinate activities for ELL Parents.   Our Family Engagement Coach, Jeanette  Diaz targets specific grades for workshops and topics have included: How to help your child with homework?, Reading  Strategies, Teaching your Kindergartener how to read, ELA What does that mean for your child? amongst others.     Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Ted Husted, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      91                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Great Expectation School                                                                              School DBN: 10X085  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      a. Parents are a vital part to our school community, so they are encouraged to participate and be part of our many  decision makings in our school. In order for this to happen, we use data to determine and monitor the language  preferences of our parents to better serve them. During registration school staff conduct an initial interview with  the parent and the student. The home language survey which is used and done during enrollment provides us  with information about the home language of the parents/guardians of our students. The Parent Coordinator and  Family Engagement Coach act as liaisons with parents/guardians to determine what the translation needs may be  and communicates those needs to the administration and other personnel of the school.   b. We use the School Parents' Preferred Language Report and the School Level Adult Preferred Language Report  which shows the language preference of the parents in written and oral language for communication.    c. At registration, and in the emergency contact "blue card" & the white card, the parents provide the languages  spoken at home and identify the language they prefer to receive information in oral and written language for   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      93      communication. This information is updated as needed and entered into the Automate the Schools system, which  will reflect on the School Level Adult Preferred Language Report.    d. At the beginning of the school year, teachers have parents fill out an emergency contact sheet where parents  also identify the language they prefer to receive information in oral and written language for communication.    e. The Parent-Teacher Association team has a volunteer form that was created to find parent’s who would like to  volunteer in our school and preferred language and also asks the parents preferred language of communication.    f. At the beginning of the school year, in Pre-K all parents are given a (ESI-R- Early Screening Inventory) parent  questionnaire in which they provide information about their children and their home language and preferred  language for communication.    .          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    Bengali (AKA  Bangladesh)   French   Fulani   Mandinka (AKA  MAndingo)   Mossi (AKA More)   English   Spanish   Soninke   Swahili (aka kiswahili)   Twi   N/A   N/A   N/A   N/A           9   5   2   1   0   528   442   7   1   1   N/A   N/A   N/A   N/A   0.9   0.   0.2   0.1   0   53.01   44.38   0.7   0.1   0.1   N/A   N/A   N/A   N/A   8   5   2   2   1   516   451   8   1   2   N/A   N/A   N/A   N/A   0.8   0.5   0.2   0.2   0.1   51.81   45.28   0.8   0.1   0.2   N/A   N/A   N/A   N/A   3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu).

Include  procedures to ensure timely provision  of translated documents to parents.    We use the template found on the  DOE website for the languages that are  covered. We use bilingual staff  personnel to assist with translations  and interpretations. The parent  coordinator uses the Blackboard  connect to send messages, emails and  texts to our parents. Staff members  use the T&I unit to submit documents  to be translated into the covered  language or reach out to a DOE vendor  for any non-covered languages.

We usually utilize in-house staff to  interpret for the parents. However,  for parents who have a preferred  language not covered by school  staff, when appropriate we use an  over-the-phone interpreter via  Language Line or hire a DOE Vendor  to send an  on-site interpreter for the covered  languages. If needed for languages  not covered by staff parents bring  their own interpreter or we provide  an outside interpreter via DOE  vendor for the non-covered  languages.    Parent coordinator translates in  Spanish using the translating device.  Other bilingual staff can assist with  consecutive interpretation for the  principal using a microphone during  meetings.
