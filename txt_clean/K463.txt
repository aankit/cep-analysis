This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The school’s mission is to prepare students to be reliable, ethical, and socially responsible communicators, and  leaders by providing them with exposure to and hands-on experience with the multi-faceted aspects of journalism.  Additionally, our goal is to graduate college-ready students who are self-disciplined and strong community members.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   The Secondary School for Journalism is located in Park Slope, Brooklyn, on the John Jay campus, along with four other  schools. The demographics and metrics for the school sit at approximately the city average. This positions us to move  the school into a range of above average achievement. We are especially focused on improving the graduation rate,  college readiness, and college entrance. Subsidiary goals to accomplish these ends include strong course-passage  rates, strong Regents passing rates, strong college readiness as measured by Regents, PSAT, SAT, ACT scores, and  evaluation of student writing.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Low performing students who have failed a course that they need to be on track for graduation.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   According to the school’s Quality Review conducted in April, 2015, SSJ’s strengths are a curriculum aligned to the  Common Core and teacher teams who work and learn together as the school strengthens its model of distributed  leadership.       A key focus for us this coming year is to strengthen our culture that emphasizes college preparation for our students  on every level, including academic and personal. By working with data on the school, discussing it, and planning from  it, we can move together as a school community and through strengthening curriculum and instruction. In addition,  we are working to re-brand ourselves as a high school to prepare students for college, so we discuss both the explicit  requirements for college, and the rigor necessary in classrooms. In 2016-17, we will establish an instructional team to  provide strong academic leadership and professional development. The planned instructional focus for 2016-17 will  be "Read. Discuss. Write." If teachers provide students with higher order thinking questions, a variety of rigorous text  and resources, then students can engage in evidence-based discussions and debates that will result in student writing  (and other products) that informs, argues, and narrates, which can then be peer and self-assessed. Furthermore, we  will focus on writing throughout the curriculum, and on non-academic skills that will be driven by high expectations  and developing leadership among our students.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 15K463   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   215   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32        Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Secondary School for Journalism, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students  Secondary School for Journalism will support parents and families of Title I students by:       ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;    ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;    ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;    ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;    ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;    The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:    ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;    ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;    ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;    ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;    ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act;    ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;    ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;       The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:    Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;    ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;    ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;    ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;    ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;    ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;    ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;    ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;    ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.       School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Secondary School for Journalism, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds  Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student  achievement between the school and the families.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?   Students are given the oral interview questionnaire to determine whether or not they have a gap of two or more years in  schooling.  If it is determined that students have a two-year gap, and they are Spanish speakers, then they take the LENS.  Our  school uses teacher-based tasks to assess early literacy skills of non-Spanish ELLs.  These tasks consist of written work as well  as assessment of students’ decoding and comprehension skills.  Students are tested specifically on phonemic awareness  through minimal pairs tasks.  The writing assessment asks students to write about their favorite time of year.  These data  provide important insights regarding our ELLs readiness for reading complex texts and engaging in high level writing tasks.  The  data also provides school staff with information about computational and mathematical understanding.  ELLs who require  further support in literacy are provided with after school tutoring opportunities as well as assistance in the ENL class.  The  instructional plan of the school takes into account student literacy needs.  Teachers provide scaffolds for our low-literacy  learners to assist them in acquiring the content while also developing literacy skills.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Co-planning ENL and Content teachers to provide instructional modifications and support for ELLs, after school programs for  academic support/Regents review     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs through various measures, including the NYSESLAT, Regents exams, class  grades and progress in language development as measured through formative assessment throughout the school  year.  Formative assessments, including journal writing, Socratic seminars, literary and argumentative writing are evaluated  based on rubrics that include language-based as well as content-based criteria.         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Programming students for ENL according to mandated minutes, Pull-out services for targeted intervention, After school and  Saturday Regents prep classes     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    N/A      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    The results from the 2016 NYSESLAT  reveal that the most challenging sections of the exam are the writing sections.  This  pattern is prevalent across grades and performance levels.  The data show that there continues to be a need for a strong focus  on helping students to synthesize information and cite evidence from complex texts.  Overall, students showed strength in  speaking skills, demonstrating that they are developing the ability to produce academic language aligned to content based  tasks.  The NYSITELL data reveal that students are at the entering level in English.  They require scaffolding in each content  area course, bilingual support and materials when available, and a freestanding ENL program with clear language and content  objectives.   Instruction is aligned with the data from the most recent NYSESLAT and NYSITELL results.  Students are  programmed according to the level they attained on these exams, and appropriate modifications are provided in their classes  according to their proficiency levels.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?

The school ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency level  through a combination of programming, using push-in and pull-out models.   Entering students receive 3 units of ENL  instruction.  1 unit is ENL standalone instruction, the second unit is integrated English as a new language in ELA instruction,  and the third unit can be either ENL standalone or integrated ENL/ELA instruction.  Emerging students receive 2 units of ENL  instruction.  At least .5 of a unit is ENL stand alone instruction; 1 unit in integrated English as a new language in English  language arts instruction, and .5 of a unit in either ENL stand alone or integrated English as a new language instruction.  Transitioning students receive 1 unit of instruction, .5 of a unit is for standalone ENL, and the other .5 is for integrated  ENL/ELA.  Expanding students receive 1 unit of instruction in integrated English as a new language in English language  arts.  Commanding students receive .5 of a unit of study in integrated English as a new language in English language arts  instruction for two years after receiving commanding on the NYSESLAT.        3.

Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.         Paste response here:  3.     Core content is delivered in English; however, when necessary students are supported in  accessing content (either through peer or teacher) in the native language.   To meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards, ELLs are provided with supports to make content comprehensible.  Supports include adapting course  materials, using leveled texts, native language support.  To foster language development, students are given explicit  vocabulary instruction, taught to use vocabulary and semantic mapping, and taught grammar through context.  ELLs’ ability to  participate in Socratic seminars and class discussions is enhanced through the use of sentence stems, and discussion  techniques that allow students to participate at their own pace.   Instruction includes various techniques, including direct  instruction, cooperative learning and student-generated questioning.  ENL teachers use common core aligned curricula, which  are content-based.  The ENL teacher uses content and language objectives in lesson and unit planning to ensure that students  are provided with the support they need to access content matter.  ENL teachers provide content teachers with glossaries,  dictionaries and translated material to support the ELLs in their content area classes.  Furthermore, they use scaffolds, such as  graphic organizers, sentence starters and text previews to engage ELLs in the content.      4.

In addition, cloze exercises and dictation passages are used to help students improve in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      writing and listening skills.  For our newcomers, the focus is on immersion in reading, writing, speaking and listening in  English.  To this end, we employ a variety of techniques and strategies in class, including vocabulary mapping, cloze and  dictation exercises, previewing for reading comprehension, retelling, writing about films and photographs, dialogue practice  and learning English structures.  Students are also given scaffolded instruction and practice for NYS examinations, with an  emphasis on reading short passages, filling our graphic organizers, multiple choice answer strategies and writing short  responses.  For ELLs who have been here for 4-6 years, we employ techniques that emphasize group work and differentiated  instruction.  We use the ‘Access’ series, which uses scaffolded activities to help students with reading in the content  area.  Students  create vocabulary maps as a means of expanding vocabulary and aiding in reading comprehension.  Long-term  ELLs have focused essay-writing strategy sessions to assist students in writing for state examinations; they learn to use graphic  organizers and highlighting of text to help with their writing.  Students with special needs choose from a variety of high  interest, accessible texts and work with graphic organizers to help them improve in their reading and writing skills.  Former  ELLs are programmed for up to two years after exiting ELL status for integrated ENL/ELA or ENL/other content area totaling 90  minutes per week.  All ELLs and former ELLs (up to two years after exiting ELL status) receive test accomodations, including  bilingual glossaries, time extension, separate location, simultaneous use of English and alternate language editions of exams,  oral translation for low-incidence language exams (except English exam).         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Paste response to question here:  8.     Teachers use graphic organizers, adapted materials, text previews, film, and leveled  texts as pre-reading activities, which support the ELL-SWD who is confronted with a challenging grade level text.  Scaffolding of  the materials is essential in providing support to the ELL-SWD.   Language development is accelerated through a focus on  learning vocabulary tier 2 and tier 3 vocabulary items.  Grade level materials include literary texts, content textbook and  primary source documents.  ELLs are supported through the use of IPads and smart boards in the classrooms.  The  administration works with the programmer to ensure that all ELL-SWDs whose IEP mandates ESL instruction receive the  appropriate program, including bilingual instruction if mandated.      7.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.
