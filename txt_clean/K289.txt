This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission Statement   Section 4: CEP Overview         We live in a rapidly changing world. At The George V. Brower School, we strive to provide all of our students with the  knowledge base and skills necessary for survival and success in today’s innovative world. We believe in the dreams of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8      our students, and work for nothing less than that every one of our students receives the opportunity to achieve all of  their goals and dreams.      At The George V. Brower School we believe in a global community of learners. We have created a global community  of students, parents, teachers and staff joined in the sole pursuit of educational excellence through academic  achievement and personal growth. At P.S. 289, we combine the New York State Common Core Learning Standards  and technology along with cutting edge instructional practices to provide a challenging and multifaceted curriculum.  Our students are led not only to master their basic analytical skills, but they are also led to develop their faculties of  personal expression and clear communication through speaking, writing, and exercise in the fine-arts. We place  strong emphasis on exploratory learning, interactive learning, computer based learning, and its applied knowledge for  today’s world.      We strive, above all, to grant our students a true base of knowledge and the skills to provide for the needs of every  student, preparing them to be lifelong learners and contributors well into the 21st century.      We believe that children ought to have esteem for themselves and their own culture as well as the culture of others.  Our children must be led to realize the importance of working and living cooperatively. We therefore place strong  emphasis in research based instruction and personal expression of ideas through argumentative writing, debating and  the creation of proposals to support their claims. Our students not only master the ability to evaluate and investigate,  they are equally able to express themselves and communicate their ideas vividly with content based vocabulary. In all  the areas of our curriculum, we emphasize scientific exploration, mathematical inquiry, and applications in  technology.      At The George V. Brower School, parents, students and staff live and work as a global community of learners,  emphasizing the needs of our students and celebrating their success.               2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    At The George V. Brower School, parents, students and staff live and work as a global community of learners,  emphasizing the needs of our scholars and celebrating their successes in preparation of College and Career readiness.      George V. Brower is an elementary school with 409 students from Pre-Kindergarten through grade 5. The school  population comprises 82% Black, 14% Hispanic, 2 % White and 2% Asian students. The student body includes 9%  English language learners and 29% special education students. Boys account for 49% of the students enrolled and girls  account for 51%. The average attendance rate for the 2017-2018 school year was 87.1%.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9         As a common core learning school, all classrooms at P.S. 289 offer a targeted instruction to meet the unique needs of  all learners. We currently use common core aligned curricula to prepare our students for success. During the past  school year, the school has used to the workshop model of instruction in the four major content areas; Language Arts,  Mathematics, Social Studies and Science. The Workshop Model allows opportunities for the teacher to provide  scholars with targeted small group instruction. In Language Arts we use Balanced Literacy to ensure that all scholars  receive instruction in reading, writing, listening and speaking. Our school uses Envision Math to provide all students  with standards based instruction in mathematics. Teachers use Harcourt Social Studies and Harcourt Science to  provide students with content based instruction. Literacy and Math instruction is supplemented with i-Ready ELA and  i-Ready Math. Blended learning is an integral part of our instructional approach. The students receive supplemental  instruction using MyOn, Ticket to Read, Imagine Learning and Voyager Math.      One of the areas of celebration at The George V. Brower School is Teacher Team Work. Teacher teams work  collaboratively to create plan, create curriculum maps, analyze student data and examine student work samples.  During the past school year, the students completed six units of study in Language Arts and nine performance tasks in  Mathematics. The teachers identified specific standards to focus on, and then delved deeper into conceptual  understanding and practice. This approach has yielded increases in student achievement as measured on the New  York State ELA and Mathematics Assessment.       School leaders support faculty members by using the Danielson Framework for Teaching and Learning. The  administrative team engages in targeted pedagogical support to improve student performance. Observations,  snapshots and Learn Walks are used to gather information to inform professional development for faculty members.  Targeted professional development includes; professional conversations, study groups, demonstration lessons, inter- visitations, peer planning and direct coaching. The Professional Learning Plan is constructed in collaboration with the  faculty members by using feedback from observations, Superintendent visits, the School Quality Review as well as the  faculty members themselves. During the forthcoming school year, the administrative team plans to increase the  frequency of observations to further develop professional skills of teachers who perform below Effective as measured  on the HEDI scale.      The faculty members at The George V. Brower school are striving to improve Family and Community Ties. In order to  support the school in meeting this goal, all members of the school community, the guidance counselor and the parent  coordinator provide support to parents including parents of English Language Learners and Student's with Disabilities.  We offer translation services to parents in their identified preferred-language and we translate school notices to  ensure that all members of the school community are made aware of all events and news. In collaboration with our  Parent Association, we also provide parent workshops that place emphasis on healthy living. Our faculty members  have conducted parent workshops to teach parents the skills necessary to help their child succeed both academically  and socially.      During the past school year we sought the need to improve student attendance. The school average attendance was  5.8% below the city-wide average for elementary schools. Consequently, we implemented clear attendance  procedures to ensure that student attendance improves. School Messenger will be used to notify parents of students'  absences. The SAPIS Counselor and Guidance Counselor will work closely with identified families to support them with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      improving their child's attendance. Students will receive incentives for improved attendance. With continued progress  monitoring and support to families, we believe that we can improve the yearly student attendance rate.      P.S. 289 has a partnership with Chess in Schools to teach students to become analytical thinkers, motivated learners,  critical problem solvers, proactive thinkers, take ownership of their accomplishments, and sportsmanship. There are  also partnerships with Arts Connection and Brooklyn Queens Conservatory of Music to bring music instruction to all  students, including English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The student body includes 11% English language learners and 23% special education students.       Our English Language Learners consist of students who speak, Arabic, Spanish, Bengali, French, Chinese and Haitian- Creole. The students have demonstrated strength in computational math and science. The 2017 New York State ELA  Assessment results show that 25.7% of the ELLS scored on Levels 3 and 4 vs. 0% in 2016. Data from the 2017 NYS  Math Assessment shows that current ELLs and former ELLs have have made a 12% gain in achievement in  mathematics. This trend has continued into the 2018 Spring semester. The end of year results for Performance Series  show that ELLs have gained 18% in Levels 3 and 4, reflecting a 37% average in the number of ELLs passing the  Performance Series Math Assessments. Some ELLs were able to move from a Level 1 to a Level 3. In Language Arts,  our ELLs continue to face challenges in reading comprehension and text analysis. The Spring 2018 Performance Series  ELA assessments show that 5% of ELLs scored a Level 4 in Reading and 19% score a Level 3. This data shows that there  is a need to focus on language development and phonics. During the forthcoming school year, we plan to utilize the  expertise of the Universal Literacy Coach to support teachers in crafting instructional lessons that support language  development.      At The George V. Brower School the students with disabilities are offered many avenues to success. We provide  intervention programs in reading and math to support students in the Least Restrictive Environment. During the 2017  - 2018 school year we continued to provide our SWD with supplemental instruction in mathematics using ST-Math  and Voyager Math. Some of our SWD have moved as many as four grade levels in math, as measured by the  Performance Series interim assessments. SWD students who used the programs with fidelity moved an average of 324  scale score points., reflecting a move of one performance level. During the 2017 - 2018 school year, we used Imagine  Learning to provide our SWD with support in Reading and the teachers focused on skill and strategy building.            4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   After analysis of the School Quality Guide, School Quality Report and feedback from the Superintendent's visits, we  have found that area of the Framework for Great Schools with the most progress in Collaborative Teachers. As noted  on the School Quality review report, Teachers Teams is an area of celebration at The George V. Brower School. With  support and professional from CSD 17 field liaisons, our teachers have been able to use the Data Wise inquiry process  to reflect and refine classroom instruction to support the unique needs of all learners. Our teachers meet during  common preps, after school and during professional development time to engage in the process of continuous  learning and peer collaboration.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         Rigorous instruction is an area of focus for the forthcoming school year. Data from the 2018 School Quality Guide  shows that the school trends 6% below the citywide average in Academic Press. Only 56% of the teachers surveyed  stated that students responded to challenging test questions in class. The District average is 61% and the Citywide  average is 66%. We plan to address by using the Next Generation Standards along with Bloom's Taxonomy Question  Stems to craft rigorous open ended questions to that challenge students' critical thinking. Additionally, we plan to use  the release questions on EngageNY to engage students test simulations.      Strong Family & Community Ties is another area of focus for the 2018 - 2019 school year. Data from the School  Quality Guide shows that the school have progressed 16% over the past three years. However, the school continues  to lag the citywide and district-wide averages. During the 2016 - 2017 the school only made an incremental progress  of 1% in improving family and community ties. We plan to address the concerns of our parents and students by  creating an inclusive community. To begin with, we will provide translators at all meetings and school functions. All  school notices will translated into the parents' identified preferred language. Our Parent Coordinator will work closely  with the Guidance Counselor, SAPIS Counselor and IEP Teacher to provide parents with information to support their  child at home. We plan to use quarterly surveys to monitor parent needs and parent feedback in regards to our  efforts to strengthen family and community ties.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 17K289   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   394   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     The results of the 2017 – 2018 School Quality Report shows that teachers are proficiently making purposeful decisions  to build coherence and college and career readiness in the English Language Arts Curriculum. There is a school-wide  genre-based writing curriculum in place that includes expository and narrative writing, as well as responses to  literature.    Each month teacher groups meet to create units of study where reading and writing are used to promote critical  thinking and reading comprehension. The units allow teachers to ensure opportunities for students to engage in  rigorous learning activities by using Webb’s Depth of Knowledge to plan differentiated activities for all learners.  During the past school year teachers developed unit plans that engaged students in four writing genres;  compare/contrast, cause and effect, chronological, and fact and opinion.   The George V. Brower School has many promising practices in place that strengthen student learning and promotes  family and community engagement. Community School District 17 has prioritized strengthening literacy skills as  achievement goals for all scholars. As a result, the school has created a framework that allows time for scholars to  read independently as well as time to write on a daily basis. This initiative has led to promising results amongst  English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities. The end of year Performance Series Assessments shows that  SWD made a 14% gain in ELA and ELLs made a 6.1 gain as compared to the beginning of the year Performance Series  Assessments.   During the 2018 – 2019 school year, the school will continue working with Teacher’s College at Columbia University to  promote writing across the content areas. We have designed six units of study that incorporate social studies and  science into the literacy curriculum. The students will be required to research and complete a non-fiction based  written assignment regarding the unit of study.   The priority need for this school year is to incorporate writing informative and explanatory content-rich texts to  examine ideas and to convey ideas and information clearly.

To address the need to build students' knowledge through  content-rich non-fiction, we plan to use content based texts as  the Principal's Book of the Month. The text will be used during  the Read Aloud to engage students in content based Accountable  Talk. The teacher teams will meet to plan strategies that will be  introduced to reflect what good readers ask themselves. Through  collaboration the teacher teams will create opportunities to  support students with developing and mastering independent  reading strategies for navigating through content based text. The  monthly writing genre will be used as an assessment to monitor  student progress in writing.   4. Non-fiction texts will be used to support student  learning in the content areas. The teacher and students  will engage in reading historical and scientific text where  there are text dependent short response questions and  extended essays to respond to after the reading. Close  Reading strategies will be used to support students'  comprehension of grade level non-fiction texts. Student  progress will be tracked with rubric based writing  assessments.

For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?   The faculty and staff at The George V. Brower School are committed to creating a welcoming and supportive  environment for all students. There are many supports available to scholars that enable them flourish  academically and socially. We have an open door policy and provide parents with support to help their  children at home, academically, physically and emotionally.       We are striving to establish a culture where students feel safe and supported so that their academic, social  and emotional needs can be met. The most recent NYC School Survey shows that 93% of the parents feel that  their child is safe at P.S. 289.       We believe that our scholars should be the decision makers in shaping the culture of our school. The Student  Council meets with the administrative team, the nutritionist and UFT Chapter Chairperson to propose new  programs, provide feedback on school activities and to collaborate on school events. During the past three  years the members of the Student Council have conducted service programs, such as the annual canned food  drive. Our scholars have selected to support our local food pantries and shelters with the donations from the  food drive.         The administrative team along with faculty members continues to analyze student data to provide students  with ongoing support in school. Upon reviewing our data, one area of concern is student attendance. The  school lags the city-wide average attendance rate by more than 6%, at an average of 87.1%. The end of year  attendance report for the 2017 - 2018 shows that nearly 45% of the students have been absent 10 or more  days during the school year. Furthermore, interim assessment data shows that students who are Chronically  Absent and or late perform below average in ELA and Mathematics.      Our priority need is to develop progress monitoring systems whereby we can collect student data to  implement strategies that support their social, emotional and academic needs thereby decreasing the number  of students who are chronically absent..          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19     Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

Brower School the faculty is engaged in collaborative planning to design learning plans that  meet the needs of our uniquely gifted scholars. Teacher Teams are currently engaged in structured inquiry- based professional collaborations using the Data Wise Inquiry Structure. Teachers engaged in low-inference  observation of student work, and focused on their implementation of instructional strategies that improve  student learning.     Lead Teachers are trained and equipped in using the Data Wise Inquiry Process to engage in collaborative  Teacher Team Work. With the support of the CSD 17 Director of Renewal School, our school is in the second  year of engagement in using Data Wise. The teams use the "I Notice/I Wonder Protocol" to engage in analysis  of student work as well as the analysis of data trends. This work has developed the teachers' capacity to self- reflect on their instructional practices and to work collaboratively to support one another in teaching and  learning.     The Teacher Teams collaborative work also includes the analyzing data to surface the achievement gaps  among the sub groups. Some of the data analyzed includes MOSL assessments, unit assessments, rubric based  writing as well as diagnostic reported from i-Ready, Imagine Learning and ST-Math.    Teacher Teams across the grades focused on improving student performance in writing as evidenced by the  implementation of a common process to improve student performance in writing. The teams worked on using  the RACER (Restate the question, Answer the Question, Cite the source, Explain the response, and Restate the  main idea) strategy to measure progress overtime. The teams also created common writing tasks and  measured student progress with the same constructed response rubric.    End of year data shows that our Teacher Team work is helping to bridge the achievement gap among students  with disabilities. The end of year data shows that on average, SWDs in Grades 1 and 2 made the greatest gains  in reading and writing, growing 1.5 grade levels as measured by Lexile Assessments.                     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23         This school year our priority will be to continue to focus our collaborative inquiry work in specific sub-groups  that appear to be lagging in ELA achievement.

The administrative team, faculty members and staff members at The George V. Brower School believes that all  scholars are uniquely gifted and have the potential to excel academically given the appropriate tools and  resources.The basis of our pedagogical practices and instructional decisions to equip scholars with the skills and  strategies necessary to become leaders in our ever changing global society. The staff's dedication to empowering  students through education can be evidenced by the 2018 School Survey which reflects that 93% of faculty members  feel responsible that all students learn and 94% of the teachers are really trying to improve their teaching.   At P.S. 289, the Workshop Model is used to provide students with targeted small group instruction. Through guided  practice along with independent and small group instruction, students are provided with opportunities to apply the  skill, strategy or concept they are being taught. Small group instruction allows for differentiation so that the teacher  may plan instructional activities that are academically suitable for each students' performance level. In all classrooms,  there is a school specific Balanced Literacy Framework and Balanced Math Framework that has been created with the  belief that all students are uniquely gifted. The Literacy and Math Frameworks allow for students to engage in  Accountable Talk, Socratic Seminars and debates. The aforementioned discussion techniques provide students with  the opportunity to think critically, use text based evidence to substantiate a point of view and establish concrete  reasoning to support their procedures and responses.   The priority need is to improve teacher practices in 3(c) Student Engagement in Mathematics, specifically in building  conceptual knowledge. The 2018 Measures of Teacher Practice reflects that 3(c) Student Engagement is an area of  growth for faculty members.

Brower School believes in partnering with community based organizations to support the needs of the  students and their family members. P.S. 289 has partnered with New York Junior Tennis League to provide after  school recreational activities for students from Kindergarten to Fifth grades. Additionally, the New York Junior Tennis  League conducts trips to cultural organizations during school recess for students and their parents. The school also  has a partnership with Chess in the Schools, whereby students develop critical thinking skills, team building skills and  good sportsmanship. The students participate in citywide competitions, in which they attend with their parents.  During the past year there was an increase in the number of parents attending chess competitions in the school and  citywide competitions. We will continue to grow our community based partnerships. During the last school year, we  were able to increase the number of after school enrichment programs.       The data reveals that parents want to be involved in supporting their child's educational journey at P.S. 289 and they  are also eager to be part of the P.S. 289 school community. We plan to offer a range of topics and times as well as  translations for our parent engagement activities. Additionally, we will work in partnership with our Parent  Association to conduct learning trips, using the Brooklyn Children's Museum as a community resource. We plan to link  our monthly units of study with the learning opportunities and trips offered to parents.   This school year we will prioritize Strong Family and Community ties by creating opportunities to engage parents in  the school, where the faculty can establish collaborative relationships with parents towards creating a culture for  learning fosters high expectations amongst staff, parents and students.

Our pre-kindergarten parents will be supported during transition into our school by allowing them to escort their  children to their classrooms. The parents are encouraged to stay with their children until they are comfortable letting  go. Parents are invited to sit with their children during breakfast, interact with the class and to accompany their  children on class trips and neighborhood walks as an extension of the common core units that are being taught in the  classrooms. Our Parent Coordinator and Pre-K Social Worker plan workshops for parents throughout the school year.  Students are assessed using the Work Sampling online program. In addition, pre-K student will have access to online  phonics and word study program.       4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The administrative team works collaboratively with the faculty to make decisions regarding assessments. Professional  development time on Mondays is used to engage teachers in professional learning activities regarding formal and  informal assessments. The administrative team works along with the Universal Literacy Coach to provide learning  opportunities with respect to creating summative assessments, rubric based assessments and performance unit  assessments.      The faculty members utilize the Common Core Learning Standards as benchmarks for student performance. Teacher  Team meetings are used as a forum to analyze student data and develop grade appropriate assessments that  measure student performance through multiple modalities. Teacher use rubrics and checklists to convey the  expectations of the instructional tasks.

Collaboration has been he key to teacher decisions regarding  assessments.       4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41        Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 289K, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       P.S. 289, THE GEORGE V. BROWER SCHOOL will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students         ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement  level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;  ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning  and decision making in support of the education of their children;  ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support  and monitor their child’s progress;  ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format,  and in languages that parents can understand;  ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to  improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between  parents and other members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43   Parental Involvement and School Quality      The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of  the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School  Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their  members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the  school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the  implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are  allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting  skills;  ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and  strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team,  the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes  providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership  skills;   ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report,  Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;  ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise  parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their  right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section  1118 and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);  ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of  the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations  and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44          ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the  school year;  ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent- Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;  ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;  ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;  ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of  their children’s progress;  ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed  about school activities and student progress;  ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a  format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Brower School, we believe that all students are uniquely gifted.  We are a Pre- K to Grade 6 school located in the a multicultural neighborhood in Crown Heights  Brooklyn.  There are 409 students enrolled and 38 of them are English Language Learners.  All  English Language Learners participate in a free standing ENL Program.  The program is  designed to support their English Language Development and to help ELLs succeed both  academically and socially.     Our ELL students are provided the required instructional minutes in ENL.  The ENL teacher  provides integrated and stand alone instruction to ensure that ELL students are supported with  content area work.  ELL students are groped according to their level of English Language  acquisition with peers of the same grade or contiguous grades.  Students engage in standards  based instructional activities and subject are work to support listening, speaking, reading and  writing in English.  The primary focus of the ENL program is to ensure that ELLs are ready to  participate and meet the demands of a rigorous curriculum that is grade appropriate and  standards based at every level.  Additionally, the ENL program uses Universal Design to  Learning to ensure that all students are provided with multiple entry points into the instructional   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         enable students to learn English by using content based units of study  support their success in all content area instruction by using non-fiction texts for   Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    activities.  As a result of our high expectations for all ENLs, the school will facilitate an after  school program for ENLs.    A review of the end of year Performance Series Data in ELA reflect a need to focus on  vocabulary development and reading comprehension in order to close the achievement gap  between ENLs and native English speakers.  The data reflected that just under a third of ELL  students were performing on grade level as compared to over 50% for native English  Speakers.  In mathematics the achievement gap between ENLs and native English speakers is  close to 12%.  This data shows that there is a need to support student improved performance on  the interim assessments as well as the state assessments.  By focusing on vocabulary  development and reading comprehension in the content areas, we believe that ELL students will  display an increase in proficiency as measured by the interim assessments and state assessments.    Title III funds will be used to facilitate an after school program.  The supplementary program  will provide additional instructional time beyond the school day.  Our goal is to provide (4)  hours of supplemental instructional time every week through our after school program.  The  goals of the program are to:     ·  ·  engagement and  ·  through shared activities and collaborative projects. &nbsp;  Instruction will be conducted in English with the use of differentiated instructional approaches  designed to help ELLs succeed both academically and socially.  Students will be engaged in  activities and group work that is standards based and that fosters critical thinking through the use  of Bloom's Taxonomy to challenge students within their zone of proximal development.  To  provide access and equity to all learners, students and staff will use technology to provide  students with visual and auditory engagement.  The ENL teacher will work collaboratively with  the content area teachers to deliver instruction that enables ELL students to engage in listening,  speaking, reading and writing in English through cooperative work, small group instruction and  Turn and Talk.    The after school program will focus on developing ENL literacy competencies including  listening, speaking, reading and writing in English.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Marc Mardy, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The George V.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      At the George V. Brower School we are committed to providing a rigorous educational experience to all scholars.  As part of our pursuit do what is best for our students, we have developed partnerships with parents and  community members. When parents enroll their children in P.S. 289, they are given the Home Language Survey  and interviewed by a trained teacher or administrator. During the interview, we obtain the language of choice for  communication. The data from from the Home Language Survey and Student Emergency Contact card is used to  inform faculty members of the family's preferred language for oral and written communication. When written  notices are sent home, they are translated into the family's preferred language of communication using  translation software as well as staff-members with written proficiency in the identified languages.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69     2.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      Our school strives to meet the needs of all families with limited-English proficiency. In case of an emergency we use  our staff members on-site who are able to speak Arabic, French, Haitian-Creole, Chinese and Spanish. We use the  office of Translation Support Services to reach families who speak Bengali. We also utilize School Messenger that  sends school-wide messages to families in Spanish.                        Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      At the beginning of the year Faculty Conference, staff members receive a copy of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 along  with training. They are provided the names of identified staff members who are able to provide translation services to  parents and family members. All faculty members are instructed to submit letters from the teacher to Principal so  that they may be translated prior to going home. Additionally, faculty members are reminded that translators are  available during the Tuesday Parent Engagement time. The extension numbers of the bilingual staff members who are  available for translation services are provided to all staff members.                        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72         Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Parents with limited-English proficiency are made aware of their right to receive information through the Parents Bill  of Rights which is provided at the commencement of each school year. Additionally, upon entering the school building  signs are posted in Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, French, Haitian-Creole and Spanish informing parents of their right to  request a translator during their visit. There is a welcome sign posted in the identified languages spoken by the  families enrolled in the school. There is also signage by the security desk and main office informing parents of  translation services offered by the school.      The Parent Student Handbook also contains information regarding translation services. When parents call the school  they are prompted to select their language of choice to be transferred to someone who can assist them. The Parent  Association works collaboratively with the faculty at the school to ensure that translators are available at Parent  Association meetings.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       To monitor and gather data regarding the school's translation services, we plan to conduct surveys and interviews of  parents and family members. After Open Houses and Parent Teacher conferences we plan to use an Feedback Slip in  the parent's language of choice to gather information regarding their experience. Additionally to gain information  regarding the effectiveness of translation services during the Tuesday Parent Engagement time, we plan to administer  quarterly Parent Surveys to gain insight into the parent's experiences and to gather information for improvement.       The school's cabinet team will meet monthly with the Parent Coordinator and Language Access Coordinator to ensure  that the needs of families with limited-English proficiency are being met.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73
