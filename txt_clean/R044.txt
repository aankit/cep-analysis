The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10         1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: SCEP Overview      Our school mission statement is: "At PS 44 we will equip ALL of our students to become life-long learners by providing  them with a positive, supportive and nurturing atmosphere that will empower our students to grow as confident  leaders."      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Public School 44, the Thomas C. Brown School, is located in the Mariner’s Harbor section of Staten Island. PS 44 is a  reflection of the diverse, low income community that it serves. Currently 90% of our students are economically  disadvantaged. PS 44 (Thomas C. Brown) is an Elementary school with 777 students from Pre-Kindergarten through  Grade Five. The school population comprises 38% Black, 51% Hispanic, 2% White, 4% Asian , less than 1% American  Indian / Alaskan Native, and 4% Multi-Racial students. The student body includes 8% English Language Learners and  34% have been identified as Students with Special Needs. Public School 44 has initiated and developed a successful  Dual Language program. PS 44 offers a Dual Language class on each grade from Pre-Kindergarten through Grade Five.  PS 44 opened the first Pre-Kindergarten Dual Language class in District 31.    Our strategic partnerships / collaborations with United Activities Unlimited (UAU), New York Center for Inter-personal  Development (NYCID), the Positive Learning Collaborative (PLC), Calvary Church, Sundog Theater, Marquis Studios,  Franklin Covey and the Wilson Language program are aligned to our school's mission. PS 44 has become a Leader in  Me school for the 2018-2019 school year. PS 44 is participating in the Learning Partners Program along with three  partner schools: PS 16, PS 41, and PS 68. The focus of this learning partnership is to elevate the instruction for our  Dual Language Learners and for our English Language Learners. We will continue to participate in Port Richmond High  School’s Community School Initiative and are working with the John Lavelle Prep charter school on a dissemination  grant to better support effective pedagogy. We also provide a summer camp program for at least 150 students.    Public School 44’s strengths include a commitment to ensuring that all students have an opportunity to attend their  home-zoned school. We offer a Dual Language (Spanish and English) program in grades Pre-Kindergarten through Five  to support our growing population of English Language Learners and to provide an opportunity for our students to  learn in two languages. We offer a variety of support services and settings for our Students with Disabilities. Our most  recent Framework for Great Schools Report suggests that P.S. 44 maintains strong family-community ties. In addition  to strong family-community ties, we have strong Teacher-Parent trust. We continue to grow our strong culture of  trust between the school and the community through our partnerships and initiatives. Our most recent Quality  Review indicates that we have an area of celebration in our capacity to maintain a culture of mutual trust and foster  positive attitudes that support the personal and academic growth of students and adults.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We consider all of our students to be special. We have three distinct student populations with specific needs: our 75  English Language Learners (ELLs), our substantial population of Students with Disabilities (SWDs), and our 19 students  who are both English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities (ELLs-SWDs). Our English Language Learners  gain proficiency in oral language (speaking and listening) before they gain proficiency in written language (reading and  writing). The greatest instructional need for English Language Learners is support with academic reading and  academic writing skills. We have a large population of Students with Disabilities. The instructional needs of this group  is as varied as the students themselves. However, two common threads are the need to increase proficiency in  academic reading and academic writing AND the need to increase proficiency in math.

These students tend to be  vocabulary-deprived, which then has an adverse effect on their academic progress.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   For the 2017-2018 school year our instructional focus was: "IF teachers use data to collaboratively plan standard  based ELA lessons that meet the needs of individuals, THEN students will demonstrate progress towards meeting ELA  grade level standards." For the 2018-2019 school year our instructional focus is, "IF teachers analyze and understand  independent reading level data to collaboratively plan standards based unit and lesson plans that meet the needs of  students through grouping, scaffolds, enrichment opportunities, and aligned resources, THEN more equitable  outcomes will be evident through an increased level of student engagement resulting in progress towards meeting  individual students' benchmark reading levels." . This instructional focus not only supports the mission of our school,  it is also aligns to the element of Rigorous Instruction (5A). We made the most progress in the area of Rigorous  Instruction.    In addition to the element of Rigorous Instruction, with a focus on early childhood literacy, two additional key focus  areas are: Collaborative Teachers (5B) and Strong Family and Community Ties (5E).                    2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 31R044   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   879   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Data from the Spring 2018 Administration of the ELA reveals that 57% of the students in Grades Three, Four, and Five  scored a Level One. 30% of the students in Grades Three, Four, and Five scored a Level Two. 10% of students in Grades  Three, Four, and Five scored a Level Three. 4% of students in Grades Three, Four, and Five scored a Level Four.   Data from the Spring 2018 Administration of the ELA reveals that zero percent of the English Language Learners in  Grades Three, Four, and Five (0 out of 34 students) scored at a Level Three or Four. Five percent of the Students with  Disabilities in Grades Three, Four, and Five (7 out of 142 students) scored at a Level Three or Four.   In recognition of the fact that the early childhood grades form the foundation for the upper grades, we have decided to  continue our focus on strengthening proficiency in literacy in the early childhood grades. After reviewing the item skills  analysis, we have identified our focus standard as: RL3 : Key Ideas and Details in Literature. Students in grades 3, 4, and  5 struggled with describing key ideas and details in literature on the Spring 2018 administration of the English Language  Arts test. We will bridge the focus on early childhood literacy with the need for stronger instruction in the area of  describing key ideas and details in literature by strengthening reading comprehension practices across all grade levels.

During the 2017-2018 school year, the School Implementation Team (SIT) met monthly to ensure that high quality  Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) are developed for each student who requires one. The School Implementation  Team was equally successful in developing high quality IEPs.    2. In the 2017-2018 school year, there were 153 classroom incidents. Staff observations, staff anecdotals, and data from  the Online Occurrence Reporting System (OORS) have identified students with behavioral challenges. These students  also have one or more of the following characteristics: high absenteeism as reported in ATS, high tardiness rate as  reported in ATS, and low academic performance as evidenced by classroom work and assessments.   The School Implementation Team observed that there has consistently been a disconnect between the Functional  Behavioral Analysis (FBA) and the Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP) developed for students who are struggling  behaviorally. Existing BIPs have not been consistently monitored and updated in order to ensure that the BIPs remain an  effective tool for the student.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           22      A review of current BIPs by the School Implementation Team has confirmed a need to monitor existing BIPs and for  newly created BIPs to be of high quality and aligned to the FBA.

High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and  paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   In order for all of the students to become poised to meet the expectations of the Common Core State Standards, the  teachers, the administrators, and paraprofessionals have all received extensive professional development. Over the  summer, teachers and administrators take advantage of the professional development opportunities that are made  available from the publishers of Amplify, Fundations, and GoMath, from the Central Office, from the Field Support  Office (FSC), and through in-house opportunities at PS 44. Teachers, administrators, and paraprofessionals will  continue to be engaged in continuous professional development regarding curriculum and instructional practices that  support multiple opportunities for students to succeed in achieving the academic expectations set by the Common  Core State Standards. Additionally, teachers and administrators will continue to engage in on-going professional  development in order to deepen knowledge of mathematical practices as part of the District 31 Algebra for All  Initiative.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information,  early intervention services, etc.).  PS 44 primarily accepts Kindergarten students from three Pre-Kindergarten programs: the Pre-Kindergarten program  at PS 44, a Head Start program, and Little Lamb (a community based organization). Records and information are  transferred from each of these programs to PS 44. The pupil accounting secretary receives the records from the Pre- Kindergarten programs and enters the information into the appropriate databases and creates cumulative files for  each new student. If a child in any of the three Pre-Kindergarten programs is in need of an evaluation, members of  the school based support team execute a “Turning 5” evaluation. The Pre-Kindergarten social worker holds numerous  parent workshops throughout the school year to support parents as the students are being prepared for  Kindergarten. The curriculum of the Pre-Kindergarten at PS 44 is aligned to the Common Core State Standards, and  vertical alignment between the Pre-Kindergarten curriculum and the Kindergarten Curriculum is in place at PS 44.   Additionally, PS 44 opened up the first Dual Language Pre-Kindergarten on Staten Island in September of 2013.  Parents of students in the Pre-Kindergarten Dual Language class receive home visits by the Pre-Kindergarten teacher  over the summer, and attend an orientation session in September. The students in the Pre-Kindergarten Dual  Language will be able to continue their education in English and in Spanish in the Kindergarten Dual Language  program. Students in the Dual Language Pre-Kindergarten participate in the activities of the Dual Language program  alongside the older Dual Language students.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     All of the teachers in the school are utilizing ELA and math programs that are aligned with the Common Core State  Standards and that contain embedded assessments. During the 2018-2019 school year, teachers will continue to  utilize the TCRWP Reading Assessments as a way to monitor student progress in reading, and the math vertical team  will create standard based math benchmark assessments as a way to monitor student progress in math. Professional  development regarding curriculum, assessments, and educational software will continue to be provided throughout  the school year. In order to meet the requirements of Advance, a local measures committee was formed. The local  measures committee met four times and went through a six step process. The local measures committee selected the  following:   ELA:   School-wide Teacher's College Running Records  Math:   The default measure was selected, which is: the Grade 4 Science Test           4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1.

Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           52        Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           53      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The Thomas C. Brown School PS 44, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students  The Thomas C. Brown School PS 44 will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           54      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           55      ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           56   School-Parent Compact (SPC)      School-Parent Compact (SPC)       The Thomas C.

Students who achieve academic proficiency as determined by the  NYSESLAT (New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test) will be able to  handle content area instruction in English. The ENL teachers have begun to implement the  SIOP (Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol) approach.       Title III funds for enrichment/supplementary activities will allow PS 44R to extend language  instruction for ELLs beyond the confines of the school day.  For the 2018-2019 academic year,  an after-school ESL Academy will be created to provide ELLs with continued opportunities for  language instruction and for language acquisition.   At PS 44R, the results of the NYSESLAT  taken by ELLS in grades 3,4 and 5 indicate that when proficiency in the modalities of reading  and writing are compared, proficiency in reading develops ahead of proficiency in  writing.  While this pattern follows typical second language development, the reality is that ELLs  in grades 3,4, and 5 have oral language skills that far surpass their written language  skills.  Our  ELLs needs to strengthen their written language skills (reading and writing).  The  results of the Spring 2018 NYSESLAT indicate the following:  Of our Grade Three ELLs, no  students are at the Entering Level, no students are at the Emerging Level, 3 students are at the  Transitioning Level, 6 students are at the Expanding Level, and 2 students are at the  Commanding Level.  Of our Grade Four ELLs, 0 students are at the Entering Level,  1 student is  at the Emerging Level, 1 student is at the Transitioning Level, 6 students are at the Expanding  Level, and 4 students are at the Commanding Level.  Of our Grade Five ELLs, 1 student is at the  Entering Level, 1 student is at the Emerging Level, 6 students are at the Transitioning Level, 19  students at the Expanding Level, and 6 students is at the Commanding Level.       In previous years, an after school ESL Academy was offered to students in grades 3,4 and  5.  An analysis of the Spring 2018 NYSESLAT administration reveals that ELLs in grades 3,4,  and 5 made modest progress toward reading and writing proficiency. It is expected that a strong  foundation in written language skills will develop by strengthening the reading and writing skills  of ELLs in grades 3, 4, and 5.  It is imperative that ELLs develop written language skills as  support for the development of strong content area skills.  A review of student work samples  confirms the necessity for additional support for ELLs in the development of writing skills.       The Title III program will be offered after school.  The after school ESL Academy will run  for approximately 19 sessions on the following dates:      THU      January 10, 2019    2:45-4:45  FRI        January 11, 2019     2:45-4:45       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   THU      January 17, 2019     2:45-4:45  FRI        January 18, 2019     2:45-4:45  THU     January 24, 2019      2:45-4:45  FRI        January 25, 2019     2:45-4:45  THU      January 31, 2019      2:45-4:45    FRI        February 01, 2019       2:45-4:45  THU        February 07, 2019     2:45-4:45  FRI         February 08, 2019      2:45-4:45  THU         February 14, 2019      2:45-4:45  FRI         February 15, 2019         2:45-4:45  THU         February 28, 2019      2:45-4:45    FRI       March 01, 2019          2:45-4:45  THU       March 07, 2019        2:45-4:45  FRI      March 08, 2019           2:45-4:45  THU     March 14, 2019           2:45-4:45  FRI      March 15, 2019            2:45-4:45    Each session will run for 2 hours.

In the event that the after  school ESL Academy is the only instructional program in the school building after the regular  school day ends, an administrator must be present.  Therefore, the after-school ESL Academy  will also be staffed by an administrator.        The after school ESL Academy is open to all ELLs in grades 3,4, and 5.  For the 2018-2019  school year, the after school ESL Academy will feature language instruction in English.  The  first goal is to develop skills and strategies that our ELLs in grades 3, 4, and 5 can use to improve  their reading ability.  The second goal is to develop skills and strategies that these ELLs can use  to improve writing ability. Students will receive targeted support as they engage in a Literacy  Workshop each week.  Teacher and students will read and discuss mentor texts that are  connected to a genre.  After the mentor texts have been discussed, students will produce a piece  of writing that is a reflection of the genre they read about and that is a continuation of the ideas  and themes they explored in the mentor texts.  The teachers will follow a gradual release model  of instruction, in which the teachers model a reading or writing strategy, the teachers and the  students practice that strategy together, and then the students use the strategy in their own  work.  Home language support will be provided through access to bilingual dictionaries and  glossaries as necessary.  The parents and guardians of the students in the Title III program will  receive correspondence in their preferred home language(s).       The materials to be used in the after school ESL Academy are supplemental and distinct from  the materials used during the school day.  The after school ESL Academy will utilize up-dated  NYSESLAT Test Prep materials to develop familiarity with the format and requirements of the  NYSESLAT and to deepen reading and writing proficiency..  In keeping with the emphasis on  deepening our students development as writers, informational text collections and  "stories and  poetry" text collections will be purchased from Attanasio and Associates.  These text collections  will support the students' development as readers and writers by allowing them to choose a text  according to their interests.  As in previous years, the Rigby ELL Assessment Kit, published by  Harcourt, will be utilized to track student progress across that four language domains, with a  particular emphasis on reading and writing skills.  A prominent feature of the Rigby ELL       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Assessment Kit is the four step process to help students achieve grade level fluency.  The four  steps are; (1) screen, (2) assess, (3) inform, and (4) instruct.       The following consumable classroom materials will be purchased for the after-school ESL  Academy: paper, pens, crayons, pencils, and folders.  The paper, crayons, pencils, and folders  will be used to support the literacy program described above.       The consumable classroom materials, the NYSESLAT test preparation materials, the text  collections from Attanasio and Associates, and the Rigby ELL Assessment Kit will be purchased  with Title III funds. It is anticipated that a maximum of $240 will be spent on consumables, and  that a maximum of $3000 will be spent on the program and assessment materials.       Student attendance records, program notification letters, returned parent permission slips, and  results of progress monitoring will be maintained by Sarah L. Hamilton, Assistant Principal, and  stored in a file in her office.

These teachers are  made aware of a variety of professional development opportunities via emails from the  Department of English Language Learners and Student Support (DELLSS).  The DELLSS offers  a variety of workshops throughout the school year.  Interested educators may register for the  workshops of their choice using the links provided in the emails.  Each teacher is able to  customize his / her own professional development.  The two teachers who will be providing  instruction in the after school ESL Academy routinely attend workshops offered by the  DELLSS.  Workshops offered by the DELLSS occur regularly throughout the school  year.  Some of the topics to be covered are: Literacy Instruction for ELLs aligned to the  Common Core State Standards, Native Language Arts Instruction, Math Instruction for ELLs,  and Response to Intervention in the context of meeting the needs of ELLs.  The professional  development sessions offered by the DELLSS are either half-day or full-day sessions.       There are many approaches to the teaching and learning of English as a Second  Language.  Among the many approaches supported by the DELLSS, three approaches in  particular complement the overall approach to instruction at PS 44.  The first approach is a  constructivist approach in which teachers and students are partners in the creation of  knowledge.  The second approach is a collaborative team based approach in which teachers of  ELLs become partners with teachers of special education students and teachers of general  education students.  In this approach, teachers are taught to view themselves as part of a larger  instructional team.  The third approach is a reflective teaching approach in which teachers are  taught to think critically about their teaching practices in order to affect change.  Reflective  teaching encourages teachers to keep effective teaching strategies and to discard ineffective       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64            Part C: Professional Development   teaching strategies.  This year our ENL teachers are participating in the District 31 training in the  SIOP approach.        Professional development for teachers who work with ELLs will be offered periodically  throughout the year, during the dedicated professional development block on Monday  afternoons.  Each professional development session will last for 70 minutes.  Sarah L. Hamilton,  the Assistant Principal in charge of Dual Language / ESL programs, will facilitate the in-house  professional development.  Professional reading will be provided to the faculty members who  participate in this series of professional development sessions.  Among the topics to be covered  during the in-house PD sessions are: Distinguishing between Language Acquisition and Learning  Disabilities among ELLs,Misconceptions about the Second Language Acquisition Process, and  Response to Intervention Models and ELLs.  Sarah L. Hamilton, Assistant Principal, will  maintain the agendas, attendance sheets, and minutes for the professional development sessions.          Additional professional development sessions will be set aside for the faculty members who  attended PD sessions offered by the DELLSS to turn-key the information to faculty members  who work with ELLs. The professional component will be provided at no cost to the  program.  The professional development, both in house and off-site, will positively impact the  progress of ELLs by providing the teachers with the supports they need in order to meet the  needs of our students.

As a culminating activity to the Title III  program, a field trip to the Museo del Barrio for students and parents is being planned for  March 29, 2019.       Parents will be notified of these activities via announcements sent home with their children,  and phone calls from the Parent Coordinator.  Communication with the parents will take place in  English and Spanish, as well as any other native language spoken by the parents (tentatively:  Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, and Urdu). The parent engagement activities will be organized by  Sarah L. Hamilton with the support of Wonda Williams (Parent Coordinator) and teachers who  work with ELLs.      Interpretation and Translation services will be made available to all families who require support  in their native language(s) in order to participate in the parent activities to be offered throughout  the school year.                   2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?   This year, PS 44R is returning to a focus on reading instruction that is grounded in the Five Pillars of Literacy: Phonemic  Awareness, Phonics, Vocabulary, Fluency, and Comprehension.    All students at PS 44, both ELLs and English proficient students, in Kindergarten, First, and Second grades are evaluated for  progress in phonemic awareness, phonics, and vocabulary (sight word) acquisition via the Fundations tracking  tool.  The Fundations tracking tool is the assessment component to the Fundations curriculum.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68        PS 44R uses TCRWP Running Records for all students in grade K through grade 5, including ELLs,  as an assessment of  Independent Reading Level (IRL).  As part of the assessment of Independent Reading Levels, the TCRWP Running Records  provide information about progress in fluency and reading comprehension.      The June 2017 Administration of the TCRWP reveals that of ELLs entering Grade One in September of 2017, one student is at a  Level A, five students are at a Level B, 2 students are at a Level C, three students are at a Level D, and one student is at a Level  E.  The Independent Reading Levels of these students range between one year below grade level to on grade level.    Of the  ELLs entering Grade Two in September of 2017, one student is at a Level EE, one student is at a Level A, two students are at a  Level B, three students are at a Level C, three students are at a Level D, two students are at a Level F, and one student is at a  level I.  The IRLS of these students range between two years below grade level to one year below grade level. Of the  ELLs entering Grade Three in September of 2017, two students are at a Level D, four students are at a Level F, one student is at  a Level G, and one student is at a Level I.  The IRLs of these students range from three years below grade level to two years  below grade level.  Of the ELLs entering Grade Four in September of 2017, one student is at a Level EE, one student is at a  Level B, one student is at a Level D, two students are at a Level F, one student is at a Level G, three students are at a Level H,  one student is at a Level J, one student is at a Level L, and one students are at a Level M.  The IRLS of these students range  from three years below grade level to two years below grade level.  Of the ELLs entering Grade Five in September of 2017, one  student is at a Level E, two students are at a Level J, one student is at a Level K, one student is at a Level N, and three students  are at a Level P. The IRLs of these students range from three years below grade level to one year below grade level.    Both the data collected from the Fundations tracking tool and the Independent Reading Levels is used to plan instruction.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The classroom teachers are responsible for the administration of the TCRWP Running Records and for the formative  assessments that are part of the Fundations curriculum. The ENL teachers and the Assistant Principal in charge of ESL & Dual  Language programs meet weekly to review the progress of the students and to plan the appropriate next steps and  instructional interventions.  The ENL teachers also meet with the grade level teachers to co-plan lessons that support both  language and content area objectives.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  ELLs in Grades 3, 4, and 5 are given the ELL Periodic Assessment in the Fall and in the Spring.  Students in the Dual Language  program are given the Home Language Assessment twice a year to measure progress in the acquisition of Spanish.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The ENL teachers and the Assistant Principal in charge of ESL & Dual Language programs will meet to review the results of the  ELL Periodic Assessment and the Home Language Assessments.  Instructional next steps will be decided based on the results of  these assessments.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   PS 44R has implemented a plan for Response to Intervention (RTI). Students are identified for academic intervention based on  a lack of growth in literacy, as evidenced by independent reading levels.  Students who have been held over, or who are  reading two (or more) years below grade level are eligible to receive RTI services.  Each round of instructional intervention  lasts approximately twelve weeks.  For the first six weeks, students (including ELLs as necessary) are identified who are in need  of Tier 2 intervention.  Students receive Tier 2 intervention for six weeks.  At the end of six weeks, the students are assessed to  gauge whether or not the instructional intervention was effective.  Students who show progress will receive three weeks of a  different type of instructional intervention.  At the end of these three weeks, the progress of all students is  measured.  Students who have made progress will continue to receive core instruction (Tier 1).  Students who have still not       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69         made progress will receive Tier 3 intervention.  These students will be re-evaluated after three weeks. This RTI plan allows for  Tier 2 and Tier 3 intervention to be introduced in a systematic way--after six weeks, after an additional three weeks, and after  a final three weeks--that is informed by data about the students' progress.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The EDAT reported NYSESLAT results for 48 students.  Of the 48 students, 13 students advanced 1 proficiency level, 4 students  advanced 2 proficiency levels, 19 students remained at the same level, and one student regressed one level.  Our students  continued their historical trend of scoring higher in the oral language modalities of speaking and listening then in the written  language modalities of reading and writing.  Our students scored the highest in speaking and the lowest in writing.  On the Spring 2017 administration of the ELA, two of our current Grade Four ELLs were exempt and twelve students scored a  Level One. All nine of our current Grade Five ELLs scored a Level One.  On the Spring 2017 administration of the Math test, all  fourteen of our current Grade Four ELLs scored a Level One. Three of our current Grade Five ELLs scored a Level Two and six  students scored a Level One.  The gains that our students are making on the NYSESLAT are not transferring to gains on the ELA or Math tests.           7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The results of the NYSESLAT, the ELA, and the Math tests have been shared with the parents / guardians of the students, the  current classroom teachers, the ENL and Dual Language teachers, and the administrative team.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The Freestanding ENL program is a blend of stand-alone (pull-out) and integrated (push-in) instruction.  Students who  are at the Entering, Emerging, Beginning, or Low Intermediate levels receive 180 minutes (4 periods) a week of stand  alone ENL instruction (the pull-out component) and receive 180 minutes (4 periods) a week of integrated ENL / ELA  instruction (the push-in component).  Students who are at the Transitioning and Expanding levels receive 180 minutes  of integrated ENL / ELA instruction (the push-in component).  Students at the Commanding levels receive 90 minutes  of integrated ENL / ELA instruction. In the Freestanding ENL Program, Mrs. Sonia Rodriguez works with ELLs in  Kindergarten, first, and second grades.  Mr. Camilo Trespalacios works with ELLs in third, fourth, and fifth grades.  All  groups on from Kindergarten through grade five are heterogeneous, with mixed proficiency levels in each group.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.        N/ A     c.  DL program.  If applicable.         The Dual Language program serves ELLs who share a grade. Students who are at the Entering and Emerging levels       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70         receive 180 minutes (4 periods) a week of ENL (English as a New Language) instruction and 180 minutes (4 periods) a  week of integrated ENL and ELA instruction.  Students who are at the Transitioning and Expanding levels receive 180  minutes (4 periods a week) of integrated ENL and ELA instruction. Students at the Commanding level receive 90  minutes (2 periods a week) of integrated ENL and ELA instruction.  This is accomplished via student grouping into  literacy groups targeted to provide either ENL instruction or integrated ENL/ELA instruction.    2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              2a. In the Freestanding ENL program, ELLs who are at the Entering, Emergining, Beginning, and Low Intermediate levels  will receive 180 minutes (4 periods) a week of stand-alone (pull-out) ENL instruction and 180 minutes (4 periods) a week of  integrated ENL (push-in) instruction.  ELLs who are at the Transitioning, Expanding, or Intermediate levels will receive 180  minutes (4 periods) a week of integrated ENL (push-in) instruction.  Former ELLs who are at the Commanding or Proficient  levels will receive 90 minutes (2 periods) a week of integrated (push-in) ENL instruction.              2b.  In addition to the ENL minutes, which are delivered as described in the answer to question 1c (see above), the  students in the Dual Language program receive 5 periods of ELA instruction and  5 periods of HLA of instruction each week.  In  the Kindergarten Dual Language class, Ms. Becera provides both ELA and HLA instruction.   In the Grade One Dual Language  class, Ms. Villasana provides both ELA and HLA instruction.    In the Grade Two Dual Language class, Ms. Tehseldar provides  both ELA and  HLA instruction.  In the Grade Three Dual Language class, Ms. Suarez provides both ELA and HLA instruction.  In  the Grade Four Dual Language class, Ms. Chau provides both ELA and  HLA instruction.  In the Grade Five Dual Language class,  Ms. Miranda provides both ELA and HLA instruction.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.       The Freestanding ENL program is a combination of stand-alone (pull-out) and integrated (push-in) instruction.  The ENL  teachers will be pulling students out of the classroom during the literacy instruction and will be pushing into the classroom  during content area instruction.  The structure of the lessons in ReadyGen follows a general pattern.  There is a whole group  lesson in which the concept for the unit of study is introduced.  After the whole group lesson, the students are aplit into small  groups for targeted instruction on language and content skills.  At the end of the lesson, the entire class re-groups for a whole- class share.  The majority of instruction time is spent working with students in small groups.  The language of instruction is  English.  Additional language support is provided to ELLs through the use of individualized word walls, the use of visual aids,  and explicit grammar instruction when necessary.  In order to meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards, the  ESL teachers will provide scaffolded support for both content area and language needs.     The  freestanding ENL program features instruction that is designed to meet the individual needs of the  students.  Differentiated instruction is particularly important since the ELLs are heterogeneously grouped.  Scaffolding  methods such as "Sensational Sentences", the increased use of visuals, personalized word walls, and "Think-Pair-Share" will be  utilized to support the development of academic language.  Bilingual dictionaries are available in the school library as home  language resources for content area instruction. There are also home language books available in the school library.  The ENL  teachers provide content area support by providing the ELLs with strategies they can use to understand concepts in science,  social studies, and math.  In the Dual Language program, GoMath / Vivan Matematicas is used as the math curriculum.  Harcourt Social Studies is used  for Social Studies in English and the parallel curriculum is used for Social Studies instruction in Spanish.  Harcourt Science is  used for science instruction in English and the parallel Spanish curriculum is used for science instruction in Spanish.  As with  teachers in the Freestanding ENL program, teachers in the Dual Language program provide content area support by providing       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71      the students with strategies that they can use to understand concepts in science, social studies, and math.           4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELLs in the Dual Language program are evaluated for progress in Spanish literacy via the Estrellitas program and via the  Spanish TCRWP Running Records.  In addition to the Estrellitas phonics program in Spanish and the Spanish TCRWP Running  Records, students are also evaluated with the end-of-unit tests in the Spanish literacy curriculum (either StoryTown/VIilla  Cuentos or Journeys/Senderos).         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    6a. To meet the needs of our SIFE students, we follow this process: (1)grade-level and age appropriate placement, (2)  identification as en ELL, (3) parent choice of program, and (4) instructional strategies geared towards newcomers. A SIFE  student needs a lot of support in order to have acess to an education.  The guidance counselor and the ESL teacher will work  with the classroom teacher to create an individualized plan to help the student.  6b.  To meet the diverse needs of the ELLs, CALLA (Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach) will be used.  This  approach is uniquely suited to the diverse needs of ELLs at PS 44R.  For ELLs receiving no more than three years of language  development support services, CALLA is vital to developing social and strategic listening skills while developing academic  language skills.  ELLs in this category face a double challenge because these students are expected to develop both the social  language they need to function within their community and these students are expected to develop academic language to  take the required New York State ELA and Math tests.  6c.  For ELLs receiving four to six years of language development support services , CALLA  can be adpated to help the students  develop more sophisticated content area vocabulary and more complex written skills.  6d.  This year, we do not have any long-term ELLs.  In previous years, the long-term ELLs who have received more than six  years of language development support services have had tremendous difficulty in acquiring reading and writing skills.  An  initial evaluation of these students revealed that these students are ELLs-SWDs.    6e.  All former ELLs, students who reached the Proficiency level on the Spring 2016 administration of the NYSESLAT and  students who reached the Commanding level on the Spring 2017 administration of the NYSESLAT will receive 90 minutes of  integrated ENL instruction per week.  As former ELLs, these students are entitled to an extension of time (time and half) on the  state ELA, math, and science tests.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELLs who are also identified as SWDS have IEPs.  These IEPs are reviewed by Sonia Rodriguez and other members of the  Language Proficiency Team (LPT) to ensure that these students receive mandated services according to their IEPs.  Mrs.  Rodriguez has access to SESIS and can look at student IEPs.  For ELLs who have also been identified as SWDs, the written  language skills (reading and writing) remain a huge challenge.  The biggest discovery in terms of reading is stamina.  The ENL  teachers will be focusing on ways to develop greater concentration and stamina when reading academic content.  The bigger  difficulty in terms of writing is the ability to receive information, think about the information critically and then write a  coherent response.  This population of students has a wealth of ideas that get lost in the transition between their thoughts and  their written responses.  The ENL teachers will be focusing on strategies that will enable the students to read about the topic,  think about a topic, and write about a topic in an organized way.  CALLA is suited to the needs of these students through the       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72      intensive use of graphic organizers.          7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  PS 44R has an array of strategies in place to allow for the diverse needs of ELLs-SWDs to be met within the least restrictive  environment.  ELLs-SWDs receive a range of services in accordance with their IEPs.  There are ELLs-SWDs who are placed into  self-contained special education classes, into Intergrated Collaborative Teaching (ICT) classes and receive SETSS services.  In all  situations, the student is placed into the least restrictive environment possible.  PS 44R embraces the philosophy of placing  SWDs into the least restrictive environment.  Students are offered services through SETSS, then placement in an ICT class, and  finally placement in a self-contained class after other, less restrictive options have been explored.  Where appropriate,  mainstreaming into math and literacy lessons is utilized.  In the Freestanding ENL program, general education and special  education students are serviced together.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  At PS 44R, three ELL subgroups receive targeted intervention programs.  The largest ELL subgroup are the students that have  been identified as ELLs-SWDs.  The following interventions will be provided: differentiated small group instruction, Tier 2 and  Tier 3 instruction (the RTI process), as necessary and specialized interventions via ThinkCentral.  Individualized small group  instruction will engage the students through different learning modalities based on Howard Gardner's theory of multiple  intelligences.  The Tier 2 and Tier 3 interventions will be tailored to meet the needs of the individual student.  ThinkCentral will  enhance the reading-writing connection through activities that engage the students in reading and writing.  The language for  these targeted intervention programs is English.  The second ELL subgroup to receive targeted intervention programs is the group of ELLs receiving language development  support services for more than four years but less than six years.  These students continue to receive language development  support services due to weak written language skills.  To enable these students to improve their understanding of content area  knowledge, both reading skills and writing skills need to be strengthened.  To improve writing skills, small group instruction  that targets content, organization, and editing will be provided.  Students will have many opportunities to write daily.  The  language of instruction for these targeted programs is English.  The third ELL subgroup to receive targeted intervention programs are the ELLs who have already received at least six years of  language development support services.  Because these particular ELLs have weak reading and writing skills, the targeted  intervention programs utilized for ELLs receiving language support services for more than four years but less than six years will  also be used for these particular ELLs.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      In accordance with the changes to CR Part 154, the ENL program will contain both integrated and stand-alone ENL  instruction.  For the 2017-2018 school year, there will be a Dual Language Kindergarten class, a Dual Language Grade One  class, Dual Language Grade Two class, a Dual Language Grade Three class, a Dual Language Grade Four class, and a Dual  Language Grade Five class.  Our Dual Language program now features one self-contained, General Education class on every  grade from Kindergarten through Grade Five.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   For the 2017-2018 school year, we no longer have a Dual Language Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) class on Kindergarten, Grade  One, Grade Two, or Grade Three.  The decision was made to shift the Dual Language classes on these grades from the ICT to a  strictly General Education model to best serve the needs of students with Individualized Education Plans who require specific  language support.  After a program wide review of student IEPs, it was found that the students' mandated instructional  requirements were not being served by placement in a Dual Language ICT.  It was found that the students' mandated       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           73      instructional requirements are best served by placement in a monolingual, English-only ICT setting for the majority of the  students with IEPs.  For a minority of the students with IEPs, the students' mandated instructional minutes are best fulfilled  with placement in an English-only ICT setting with an alternate-placement paraprofessional.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  The following program is offered to the entire school population: UAU (United Activities Unlimited).  At the beginning of the  school year, information was provided to the parents in English and the appropriate home languages about these  programs.  UAU is an enrichment programs that provide the students with a variety of activities, including arts and crafts.  The  funding sources for these programs is derived from a variety of outside sources.  All programs include ELLs among their  students.  Whenever a program is offered at PS 44R, every effort is made to ensure that ELLs' participation is welcomed.  We also offer a Title III Afterschool ESL program.         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.     The following technological support for ELLs is in place: Laptops are available in the classrooms, interactive whiteboards are  used throughout the school, the school has a state-of-the-art computer lab, students receive instruction in computers,  overhead projectors are available throughout the school, and a variety of computer-based instructional materials are utilized.  Students in both the freestanding ENL and the Dual Language programs have access to instructional materials and to books in  their home languages.          13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support varies according to the type of program model.  In the Freestanding ENL program, home language  support is present through access to books in the home language.  There is always home language support available to the  students.  In the Dual Language program, instruction takes place in both Spanish and English.  The split between Spanish and  English is roughly 50% Spanish and 50% English.  The Dual Language program features a full Spanish language curriculum in  literacy, science, Social Studies, and math.          14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Both the Freestanding ENL and the Dual Language programs provide age appropriate services for ELLs.  For ELLs in the lower  grades, the instructional focus is on building a strong foundation in terms of literacy skills.  In the upper grades, the  instructional focus is on providing ELLs with the content area skills required for academic success.  The Kindergarten Dual  Language class follows the Kindergarten curriculum.  The Grade One Dual Language class follows the Grade One  curriculum.  The Grade Two Dual Language class follows the Grade Two curriculum.  The Grade Three Dual Language  class follows the Grade Three curriculum, and the Grade Four Dual Language class follows the Grade Four curriculum.  The  Grade Five Dual Language class follows the Grade Five curriculum.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?       The following technological support for ELLs is in place: Laptops are available in the classrooms, interactive whiteboards are  used throughout the school, the school has a state-of-the-art computer lab, students receive instruction in computers,  overhead projectors are available throughout the school, and a variety of computer-based instructional materials are utilized.  Students in both the freestanding ENL and the Dual Language programs have access to instructional materials and to books in       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           74         their home languages.          16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Any identification of newly enrolled ELL students prior to the beginning of the school year is dependent upon the availability of  appropriately trained staff to administer the NYSITELL.  During the school year, newly identified ELL students are placed in  grade appropriate classes.  Newly identified ELLs are welcomed into the PS 44R community, and are given equal opportunity to  participate in the extra-curricular activities alongside their classmates.         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    There are no language electives offered to ELLs at this time.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   A. In all our our Dual Language classes, from Kindergarten through Grade Five, we use a self-contained  model.  On each grade, the teacher (who is fully bilingual) provides instruction in English and in  Spanish.  50% of the instructional time is allocated for instruction in English and 50% of the instructional  time is allocated in Spanish.  Students in the Dual Language classes have 25 periods of instruction from  their teacher each week. 12 periods a week feature English as the language of instruction and 12 periods  a week feature Spanish as the language of instruction.  Some weeks may have an extra period of  instruction in English, alternating with weeks that feature an extra period of instruction in  Spanish.  EPs and ELLs are integrated for approximately 80% of the instructional day.    B. Math, Social Studies, and Science are all taught in both English and Spanish.  Reading and Writing are  taught as a literacy block.  There are literacy blocks in both English and Spanish.    C. All Dual Language classes follow a 50-50 model.  Some classes feature 1/2 day instruction in English  and 1/2 day instruction in Spanish each day.  Other classes alternate between a full instructional day in  English and a full instructional day in Spanish.    D. Emergent literacy is taught in both languages simultaneously.         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           75      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  There are three approaches to the teaching and learning of English as a New Language that the Department of English  Language Learner Support Services (DELLSS) supports.  The first approach is a constructivist approach in which teachers and  students are partners in the creation of knowledge.  The second approach is a collaborative team based approach in which  teachers of ELLs become partners with teachers of special education and teachers of general education students.  In this  approach, teachers are taught to view themselves as part of a larger instructional team.  The third approach is a reflective  teaching approach in which teachers are taught to think critically about their teaching practices in order to affect  change.  Reflective teaching encourages teachers to keep effective teaching strategies and to discard ineffective teaching  strategies.  All ELL personnel in the school will be exposed to constructivist, collaborative, and reflective teaching practices as  part of the professional development plan.  All  teachers of ELLs are regularly informed of PD opportunities offered through  the DELLSS.     Professional development for teachers who work with ELLs will be offered at PS 44R.  PS 44R will offer professional  development that embodies a constructivist approach, collaborative teaching, and reflective practice.  The professional  development to be offered at PS 44R will target cluster teachers and classroom teachers that have a significant number of  ELLs.  A total of ten hours of professional development will be provided during the school year.  Sarah L. Hamilton, Assistant  Principal, will provide the in-house professional development.  Research articles regarding text complexity will be provided to  faculty members.  Among the topics to be covered are: An Introduction to Text Complexity, Text Complexity and Vocabulary  Development, Text Complexity and Content Area Reading, and Implications of Text Complexity for Writing.  Attention will be  paid to instructional strategies for ELLs that are also effective for students with disabilities (SWDs).     PS 4R has implemented the GoMath curriculum at all grade levels, PreKindergarten through Grade Five.  PS 44R has  implemented the Mondo curriculum for grade levels 3, 4, and 5.  Grdaes 3, 4, and 5 have built units of curriculum utilizing  resources from Teacher's College and RedayGen.  Mondo and GoMath are aligned to the Common Core standards.  In the Dual  Language program, StoryTown / VillaCuentos is used in Grade One.  The teachers have worked to align the bilingual literacy  curriculum to the Common Core.  In Kindergarten, and in Grades Two, Three, Four and Five, Journeys / Senderos is used as the  bilingual literacy curriculum for the Dual Language program.  Journeys / Senderos is aligned to the Common Core.           2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The core staff that is responsible for helping ELLs transition from elementary school to middle school are the fifth grade  teachers.  As ELLs transition from elementary to middle school, they need a firm foundation in content area skills and the  ability to work more independently.  The ENL teachers support the move toward independent work and toward greater facility  with content area material through collaboration with the fifth grade teachers.  There are inter-visitations to the middle  schools that receive students from PS 44R.  Mrs. Williams (Parent Coordinator), Mr. Robert Palumbo (Assistant Principal), and  Ms. Benetta Amet (Guidance Counselor) assist all fifth graders, including ELLs, with the transition to middle school.                     2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           76      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Annual individual meetings for parents of ELLs will be scheduled during the Tuesday afternoon sessions that are set aside for  parent engagement activities, and at times that are convenient to the parents.  Morning appointments and afternoon  appointments will be made available.  Mrs. Rodriguez and Mr. Trespalacios can provide interpretation and translation in  Spanish and the Translation and Interpretation Unit will be utilized for language access to Arabic, Urdu, Yoruba, and Chinese.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents of ELLs are included in all of the parental involvement activities at the school.  In the Dual Language program, parent  workshops for both parents of ELLs and parents of EPs are offered throughout the school year. During the the 2017-2018  school year, the Dual Language Parent Council will meet once a month to discuss concerns, celebrate successes, and consider  future directions for the Dual Language program.  Parents of ELLs in the Freestanding ENL program are invited to attend a  series of parent workshops throughout the year.               Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    While the intent of the LAP is to describe programs for ELLs in grades Kindergarten through Five, PS 44R was given the honor of  opening up the first Dual Language Pre-Kindergarten on Staten Island.  In September of 2013, PS 44R opened its first Dual Language  Pre-Kindergarten class. We have maintained that Pre-Kindergarten class.                             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           77   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Sarah L. Hamilton, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           78                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Thomas C.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Quantitative methodologies were used in the needs analysis of translation and interpretation services at PS 44R.  Three sources of quantitative data that inform this particular needs analysis are: (1) Home Language Identification  Surveys (HLIS), (2) Student Emergency Contact Cards, and (3) ATS reports. In particular, the RAPL (School Level  Adult Preferred Language Report) and the RADL (School Level Adult Detail Report) were utilized. Based on the  information provided in the Home Language Identification Surveys, the Student Emergency Contact Cards, the  RAPL report, and the RADL report, the largest translation and interpretation need continues to be Spanish. A  review of these data sources reveals that Arabic, Urdu, and Chinese are also preferred languages among our  parents. Of the 71 English Language Learners at PS 44R, 59 students have Spanish as a native language, 4 students  have Urdu as a native language, 5 students have Arabic as a native language, and 2 students have other languages  as a native language. However, we recognize the reality that although a child may be a former ELL or may have       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           80      never received ESL services, that child's FAMILY may indeed speak a language other than English. We will continue  to make very effort to communicate with all of the parents in our community.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The Welcome Poster is prominently displayed outside of the main office. There are Language ID Guides present at the  security desk and in the main office. The Parents' Bill of Rights and the Parents' Guide to Language Access will be sent  home to families via their children's backpacks. Copies of the Parents' Bill of Rights and the Parents' Guide to  Language Access will also be available during each of the Parent Teacher Conference meetings.         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?          We will send out a brief survey to the parents in January as a mid-year check on the quality and availability of services.  We also take attendance at parent meetings and workshops. If we find that parents from our Arabic, Chinese, and  Urdu families are not attending meetings, it could be a red flag that we are not providing proper language access for  these families.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           86
