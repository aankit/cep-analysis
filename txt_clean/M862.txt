This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mott Hall II is dedicated to the academic and personal development of scholars who will become tomorrow's leaders.  Scholars are challenged to question, anticipate and solve problems, assume personal responsibility, and emerge as  enthusiastic life-long learners and independent thinkers motivated by the pursuit of academic excellence and social  responsibility.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Mott Hall II graduates will be independent and inquisitive young people on the path to being life-long learners and  doers. All learning at Mott Hall II takes place in the context of the age of technology into which our scholars are born  and in which they will someday lead. Scholars receive the individual attention they need in order to thrive. In an  atmosphere like that of a family, both caring and firm, scholars are challenged by a rigorous scholastic program and  nurtured by activities that address their developmental progress from child to adolescent. Mott Hall II teachers not  only encourage creativity and critical thinking, but self-discipline and responsibility as well.    The Mott Hall II philosophy of educating the whole child is realized through innovative courses that provide academic  challenges and cultivate personal initiative. Courses and enrichment activities within and beyond the regular class  schedule reach into the city, linking scholars to the world of work, the natural environment, community service, the  arts and higher education. These programs include partnerships with Urban Advantage Middle School Science  Initiative, Columbia University Teachers College, Manhattan School of Music, Asphalt Green, Society for Educational  Arts, and Sheltering Arms After-School Program. Core courses include English, Social Studies, Mathematics, Science,  Art, Music, Physical Education, and foreign language.    We also abide by and adhere to the following guidelines and values:      We take responsibility for results: We take responsibility for the results of our scholars. We do not make excuses for  poor student achievements. We constantly ask ourselves what we can do to improve the achievement and  engagement levels of our scholars.    We act professionally: We are positive, optimistic, pro-active, and professional with our scholars, their families and  with each other.    We are dedicated: We believe that we must work harder than what is sometimes expected of educators elsewhere in  order to achieve the results we want. We are dedicated to making the school’s goals a reality.    We sweat the details: We sweat the details, particularly regarding student behavior, engagement, organization and  academic achievement. We believe that if we make a big deal of the little problems, then big problems will never  materialize.    We are caring and strict: We are both caring and strict. We are comfortable with our authority as adults, however, we  also know that we must strive to build deep, caring, trusting relationships with each student.    We have high expectations: We have very high expectations for student behavior and academics. We are constantly  measuring the realities of every day against these high expectations and constantly readjusting our practices, actions  and mentalities to reach them.    We act with a sense of urgency: Mott Hall II is uniquely suited to close the achievement gap. Most of our scholars  enter the school performing at grade-level or better. We must use every minute of every class as efficiently and  productively as possible in order to ensure that our scholars are able to compete with students from other rigorous  schools. We also must ensure that our scholars succeed in high school and college.    Our school, our success: Success can only be obtained if all stakeholders (administration, teachers, parents, students,  etc.) work together to achieve our goals.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Mott Hall II serves students with disabilities and ENL students. Their specific needs include a modified curriculum;  additional teaching staff to provide support; academic intervention services when necessary.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Mott HalI's enjoyed the most significant growth with Strong Family-Community Ties. The school grew from 3.99 to  4.36. For the 2018-2019 school year, Mott Hall II will place the greatest emphasis on rigorous instruction as we absorb  students from P.S. 165 and work to accelerate the pace of learning for all scholars.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 03M862   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   342   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

NA        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. [Mott Hall II] , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Elementary and Secondary School ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy  to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      [Mott Hall II] will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Mott Hall II utilizes STAR Reader and Accelerated Reader to baseline all ELL scholars and to measure their progress. the  school's instructional plan places a strong emphasis on literacy instruction. Through the use of these softwares, we are able to  learn reading level (grade level), percentile rank, instructional reading level, language acquisition and level of achievement as it  pertains to the reading of literature and informational text. Once this information is determined, we subsequently provide  targeted support to scholars, through the use of leveled and differentiated tasks, to ensure growth throughout the school  year.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our ESL program by how well scholars do during the course of the year in their core classes as well  as how they do on NYC performance tasks, school performance tasks, and NYS Assessments (ELA, Math and Science). Progress  made on STAR Reader and Achieve 3000 is also closely assessed to determine if scholar's met their individualized goals as set  forth by ENL teacher.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Not applicable to Mott Hall II.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Our ELLs have made progress and all are considered advanced.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Instruction is delivered in 55-minute periods throughout the day.  a. There are many organizational models in place: Push-In (Co-Teaching), Pull-Out, Collaborative as well as Self- Contained models are evident across disciplines.  b. Program models include block periods where classes travel together as a group. classes are set up Heterogeneous  formats.The ENL pull-out class consists of an upgraded format where students are in mixed grades.  c. In the stand alone model, scholars are grouped homogeneously, regardless of grade, as Mott Hall II only has  advanced level scholars.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   The mandated number of instructional minutes, as per CR Part 154, are provided by a certified teacher in each core class as  well as during their scheduled ESL class.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50       a. ESL instructional minutes are delivered specifically in eight 55-minute periods a week. The remainder of the mandated time  is delivered during ELA classes throughout the day, all week as a push-in program. ELA classes are comprised of five one hour  block periods, for a total of 300 instructional minutes per week. Beginner ELLs and intermediate ELLs receive a total of 360  minutes a week of services. Advanced ELLs receive 180 minutes of mandated service a week. Sixth and seventh graders receive  Spanish as a second language while eighth graders are in a class of native speakers.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Content areas are delivered in 55-minute periods in a heterogeneous setting. Word walls are evident in each classroom and  are accessible to all students. the objective (aim), "do now" and lesson are always visible on the whiteboard or on the "ELMO"  screen. New vocabulary introduced to students each period is always written in a designated area so that it is easily visible to  students. Teachers orally go over lessons thoroughly and repeat segments of lesson if students are unclear. Visual aids,  manipulative, pictures and technology are used in the content areas to facilitate understanding and language development. In  addition, instructional lessons are developed around the Common Core Learning Standards across disciplines. Student learning  focuses on meeting set goals specific to the Common Core. The ENL teacher provides specific scaffolds, such as graphic  organizers, vocabulary support, and individual attention to support content area learning for ELLs. As additional support,  Achieve 3000 is use dto develop targeted Common Core Learning Standards across disciplines.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Evaluations of ELLs are determined by the HLIS. If a language other than English is considered the primary language then  student is evaluated accordingly. For students whose home language is Spanish the Spanish LAB is administered. They are also  provided with translated versions of the NYS test for Science, Social Studies, and Math, if available in their home language.  Glossaries are available for State tests as well as class use.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Instruction is differentiated for ELL subgroups by how students are grouped. More advanced students might be paired with  intermediate students to assist with given tasks. Individual conferencing between student and teacher is often an occurrence.  During individual tasks teacher works with individuals for a given time frame.  a. We currently do not have SIFE students. If we did have SIFE students our plan would be as follows: We would provide AIS  once a day where students would receive decoding and fluency instructions using the Wilson Program. These students would  also be mandated to participate in the Extended Day program. We would develop an after school program that would provide  NLA instructions which will develop their academic skills in their native language. Classroom instructions would be in a small  group with many one-to-one teaching opportunities. Students' library would consist of low inference/high interest books.  Students would be provided with visual aids as much as possible.  b. In addition to the services above, newcomer's participate in a before school program which focuses on the listening and  speaking modalities. ENL teacher provides a mini lesson targeting listening and/or speaking skills, then students are directed to  either the listening centers to practice skills or to work in groups to develop skits which will present to the class as a group.  c &d. The plan for ELLs receiving services for 4 to 6 years and long-term ELLs is the same. ELLs participate in a more rigorous  program (ENL) where they engage in reading more non-fiction texts. Emphasis is made on writing skills through continuous  response to non-fiction text. Writing assignments and projects require more extensive and elaborate detail. A wide range of  academic vocabulary use is expected and taught throughout all content area. They receive additional instruction during  extended periods throughout the day.  e. Former ELLs still receive testing accommodations for two years after becoming proficient. This includes acomodations such  as time and a half and separate location for standardized testing. Additionally, former ELLs receive 90-minutes of ENL services  for two years.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL-SWDs are taught using low inference/high interest books, manipulative, visuals aids, and pictures to teach content areas.  Special education teachers consult on a regularly basis to best serve those students. ENL teacher uses her time with the ELL- SWDs to emphasize and reinforce materials and content being taught by special education teachers. Total Physical Response  method is used to teach ELL-SWDs. Some instructional strategies used are graphic organizers, visuals, audio, cooperative  learning activities, modified class work, and multicultural resources. Materials used to accelerate English language acquisition  include flow charts, maps, charts, graphs, pictures, t-charts, venn diagrams, time lines, computers, videos, films,  demonstrations, labeling, music, books, games, journals, community resources, check-lists, and portfolios. These materials  provide extra support for English language acquisition through content area learning.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL-SWDs students are participating in an Explorations program which offers the student individualized instruction for at least  one hour a week according to the data obtained from the ELA test scores. All our ELL students receive two hours of ESL  instruction in a Pull-out and Push-in program where skills are taught according to the results of the NYSESLAT scores. Flexible  scheduling is used to ensure that scholars are able to participate with their non-disabled peers. this includes aligning after  lunch classes so that ELL-SWD students have the opportunity to take enrichment classes with their non-disabled peers.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  ELL students receive targeted individualized instruction during the Learning Explorations period each week. This instruction,  which is grounded in the NYS ELA & Math item analysis tool, is tailored to the individual need of each student. ELL students  receive targeted instruction in both math and literacy. Additionally, student teachers provide extra support in the classroom  during instructional time. During lunch hours eighth grade teachers offer a quiet space for students to do homework.  Assistance, if needed, is also offered in all subject areas by the teacher. The social studies teacher offers help with writing  during lunch hours, as well as afterschool, targeting students who demonstrate low levels of writing skills. The Latin teacher  also offers homework help during lunch hours, as well as afterschool, targeting students who are struggling in their language  classes, the science teacher offers weekly afterschool tutoring for students who are struggling in science. We also have two  afterschool sciences classes. Sixth graders are offered a class dealing with neurosciences and eighth graders are offered a class  in alternative energy.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the 2015-2016 school year, Mott Hall II is offering Latin for the first time. This new program will enhance the language  development of our ELL scholars. Additionally, Achieve 3000 was purchased to better support ELL scholars. Leveled articles and  other critical tools are now accessible for teachers to use with these students.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Mott Hall II has a rich after school offering including the Sheltering Arms program, sport teams, science enrichment, Latin  dance, and other initiatives. All our ELL students participate in all the extracurricular activities, all the sports programs and in  all our school trips and evening activities and social dances. All AIS is offered to ELLs before school, after school and during  lunch. Our ELLs are invited to fully participate in all activities through various school communication methods such as phone  calls, newsletters, fliers, and bulletins. Each source of communication is available in the home language of each ELL in order to  promote and encourage attendance.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Glossaries, dictionaries, laptops, chromebooks, literacy software, low inference/high interest books, and Spanish books are  used in all core classes.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   For our Spanish speaking ELL students, native language support is offered during foreign language class. They are also provided  with dictionaries, glossaries and Spanish libraries. In addition, students are able to use Google translate in class.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    By basing all instructional decisions in sound data, the school ensures that all scholars, including ELLs, receive the appropriate  services and supports. Additionally, teachers set goals for scholars to ensure that they progress throughout the school year.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Glossaries, dictionaries, laptops, chromebooks, literacy software, low inference/high interest books, and Spanish books are  used in all core classes.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   For newly enrolled students, we hold two orientations at the beginning of July and at the end of August every year, where  incoming students are given a tour of our building. During this orientation we also inform them of the expectations and  supports available to them throughout the school year. Students have an opportunity to meet teachers and ask questions at  that time. The ENL teacher, the parent coordinator, as well as administration are involved in these activities.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    latin is offered to all ELL scholars     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Mott Hall II does not have a dual language program.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  1. ELL personnel often participate in professional development workshops outside the school building targeting specific models  such as SIOP twice a month. All teachers of ELLs also attend monthly meetings lead by the ENL teacher. Topic discussions  include teaching strategies used with ELL students and specific ways we can develop academic language. All subject teachers  receive professional learning support with literacy instruction. The school places a strong emphasis on the use of Achieve 3000  and the Basic Writing Program to support ENL language development. The Principal and Assistant Principal receive support  from the District under the leadership of Superintendent. This includes guidance on implementing CR 154 and best practices  for creating an inclusive environment for ELLs. Guidance counselors receive professional development on creating an inclusive   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         environment for ELLs. The school secretary is also trained on how to welcome families and support ENLs as they transition into  our school.  Professional learning is offered in various forms to support implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards for ELL  students. First, department teams are required to identify priority standards to support ELL scholars. For the 2015-2016 school  year, vocabulary and language acquisition are areas of focus for ELL students. Additionally, all teachers are trained on utilizing  strategic supports during instruction to ensure that tasks are leveled and differentiated to accommodate the unique needs of  ELL students. The ENL teacher attends monthly PDs focusing on the NYSESLAT and on teaching and learning strategies specific  to English language acquisition.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The school participates in two High School fairs a year. Staff are given sample mini lesson to do with their students so they are  prepare to participate in the HS fairs in a way that is meaningful to them. Teachers are also given the opportunity to take their  students on HS visits to further prepare them for their transition. We also provide college tours to provide students a look at  their future and help them set long-term goals. Guidance counselors receive training on how to create a welcoming and safe  environment for ELL students.  Continuous professional development is given to teachers throughout the year that goes over the 15% minimum hours and  50% total for ENL teachers. The school relies on the Manhattan field Support Center to provide professional development to  the ENL teacher. The ENL teacher participates in the MFSC QTEl Institute. In addition to this we are offering the professional  development in the Language Allocation Policy LAP Tool Kit Facilitators Guide from the Office of Language Learners to the staff  by the ENL teacher. The ENL instructor attends professional development throughout the year as per the expectations set  forth by the DOE. Sign-In sheets are kept of teachers who attend all professional development and agendas are maintained in  a file at Mott Hall Ii. ELL specific topics include NYSITELL/NYSESLAT training and ELL specific learning and teaching strategies for  English acquisition through Common Core Learning Standards. Topics of training includes helping scholars access the text;  creating an inclusive environment in the classroom; and differentiating materials so target specific subgroups.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   We have a very small group of ELLs in our school and the parents are informed by the ENL Coordinator, through scheduled  annual meetings, as to the progress of their child. All our parents are invited to functions in our school and since the majority  of our ELL parents are Spanish speaking we have bilingual staff members who are available at all meetings and parent reach  out to ensure communication. We have a strong, involved PTA, consisting of ELL and non-ELL parents/guardians. All  parents/guardians including the parents/guardians of ELLs are invited to attend parent curriculum workshops, PTA meetings,  SLT meetings and other meetings with staff administration including other scheduled social and cultural events. Parents are  encouraged to participate in information meetings here at the school and join in High School tours and the district Middle  School Fair so they are more fully aware of educational options for their children. The PTA reaches out of get parents involved  in planning, as well as, participating in these events. Parents are kept informed by letters and updated calendars. Parents are  invited to attend all PTA meetings, parent teacher conferences, classroom events, concerts, fairs, information meetings and  graduation ceremonies. They are notified by phone, letter, PTA happenings, information boards & bulletin boards, etc.  Translation is provided by ENL teacher, other teachers, fellow parents and DOE translators.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Considering our small number of ELL scholars, our participation is rather high. Almost all ELL parents attend most parent  events including PTA meetings and student after school events. ELL parents are also given access to Engrade Pro, an online  grade book, so they have the ability to track the performance of their scholars. To ensure adequate use of this software, ELL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         families receive all information translated and can attend parent breakfasts to learn how best to gain access to everything the  school offers.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Marlon Lowe, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                 School DBN:   Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
