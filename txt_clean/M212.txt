This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   As per our mission statement, the key focus of Midtown West School (MTW) is to foster an environment in which  children, parents and staff from diverse backgrounds work together in a nurturing and academically rigorous school  community.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 212 Midtown West School prides itself on our rich and engaging social studies core curriculum. This core  curriculum compels students to examine the world as researchers, breaking the boundaries of the classroom to  include New York City, its suburbs, rural New York, and the World. Students at Midtown West engage in  interdisciplinary units of study that blend literacy, mathematics, the arts, STEM (science, technology, engineering &  math), and social sciences.    Some of the unique characteristics of Midtown West School that support the Frameworks are listed below.     School-wide looping structure. The grade structure at Midtown West School is composed of three two-year loops in  which cohorts of students remain with the same teacher for two consecutive years (K/1, 2/3, 4/5).     Interdisciplinary curriculum . Midtown West School subscribes to an interdisciplinary learning philosophy through  which students appropriate their learning through child-centered, project-based opportunities such as extensive units  of study, class museums, and historical re-enactments. These learning experiences blend multiple content areas so as  to expose students to an intellectually rich and authentic experience and provides the rigorous instruction as  described in the Framework.    Community Meetings . Every Friday morning, the entire school community – including parents – meets in the school  auditorium to sing, celebrate students, learn about school-based events, and watch students perform. This  atmosphere of solidarity is also present at the classroom level where each class meets briefly as a group in the  mornings to engage in community building curriculum. This process creates trust and fosters parent engagement as  described in the Framework.   Family inclusion . Midtown West families are invited into the school each day to drop their child(ren) off at the  classroom door. School security knows parents by name and actively greets families as they enter. In grades pre-k, k,  and 1, families are invited into the classroom to spend a few minutes participating in the morning routines. As of this  school year, to increase security and better identify parents within our shared building, all parents and caregivers  have been given school specific ID badges. We are working to further increase security while maintaining the open  door policy by meeting with the Executive Board to find ways to strengthen the use of the ID badges.    Service Projects . Students in 4 th and 5 th grades at Midtown West are asked to serve in a year-long service project.  These service opportunities include Peer Mediators, Penny Harvest, Peer Tutors, Student Action Team, Library Squad,  and the Green & Healthy Team. We believe that students can and should be committed to serving the school  community, neighborhood, and larger global causes. It creates a supportive environment and builds trust between  the upper and lower grade classes.    The Arts . Midtown West School believes that a critical part of students’ education is the Arts. As such, our  curriculum includes partnerships with various arts organizations in which an artist-in-residence works with students.  We also partner with theatre and danced based organizations to dramatize major social studies units. This process  allows teachers to collaborate with both outside artists and one another as grades and classes work together. We also  employ full time Music and Art teachers to further enhance and support the curriculum.    Clubs . All students from grades 1 - 5 are able to choose a club in which to participate one period a week. These  clubs consist of students from multiple grades and include activities such as gardening, yoga, Math Olympiad, etc. The  process allows students from various grades to collaborate and build trust. It also allows teachers to work with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      students outside of their regular classroom, fostering collaboration between teachers and builds trust among the  community. Parents with a special talent or hobby to share are encouraged to direct students within a club as well.    Collaborations with Bank Street, Teachers College, and Metamorphosis Teaching and Learning Communities. All  staff participate in regular and ongoing professional development that occurs both in house and at lab sites. This staff  development is provided by expert staff developers in reading, writing, social studies and math. This process builds  effective school leadership as teachers support and turn-key for one another. It raises the level of instruction building  rigor. It also fosters collaboration between teachers through planning sessions, loop meetings and inter-visitations.    Family Conferences. Family conferences are one of the rich opportunities in which MTW families – including the  student – engage in conversations with the teacher three times throughout the year. These conferences are a  dialogue between teacher, student, and parent(s) that encourage open communication about the accomplishments  of the learner. It is also an opportunity for teachers and students to craft and share goals (with the input and support  of the parents) and develop action plans to achieve the goals.   Parent communication/Reporting . In order to enhance our home-school communication (including our academic  goals for students), MTW has designed our own report cards. These report cards were a part of a collaborative  process in which teacher teams designed a reporting tool that both reflected the work of MTW and included the  Common Core Learning Standards. These report cards are closely aligned to the goals and mid-year reflections. In  addition to comprehensive reporting of student progress, teachers communicate to parents via weekly newsletters.   Community Standards - PS 212 Midtown West has created Community Standards through collaboration between  teachers, students and leadership that supports respect, responsibility and problem solving.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The school has a small ELL population, as well as students with IEP's that require SETTS and other related services.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The Key Areas of focus at PS 212 Midtown West   As per our mission statement, and in direct connection with the Framework for Great Schools, the key focus of  Midtown West School (MTW) is to foster an environment in which children, parents and staff from diverse  backgrounds work together in a nurturing and academically rigorous school community. As a result, we have  developed many goals that involve students, teachers, and families. These goals range in nature from the formal goals  stated in our CEP to those of various committees to the goals of our teacher inquiry teams. The committees each help  to build a level of trust and strengthen Family-community Ties. Each goal is aligned to four key areas that collectively  serve to promote our instructional focus of Engaging Students in Learning . These school-wide priorities are as  follows: 1) participation in purposeful inquiry, 2) development of curriculum and assessment. Both of these goals are  directly related to the elements of the Framework around rigorous instruction and a supportive environment. 3)  culture of professional development, and 4) the crafting of professional goals to drive all instruction. These goals  support the element of Collaborative teachers. These priorities guide me as the instructional leader, supporting the  element of Effective School Leadership, to set my own goals for school improvement. These goals include: increased  student performance in ELA and Math, development of habits of inquiry within staff, fostering a culture of  professional development and teacher leadership, increasing practices that engage students in learning, and the  development of horizontal and vertical pacing calendars.   Key Areas of focus for Teachers’ as Educators:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      1. As a part of a collaborative observation process in which teachers participate in examining the Danielson  Framework during our feedback sessions, teachers are able to reflect on their own professional goals that were  crafted in September. Collaboratively, we identify the elements of one or two components that were evidenced in the  lesson and design goals to support the teacher’s growth to the next level.    2. By the end of the 2018/2019 school year, all teachers will have had the opportunity to lead one or more  professional development sessions and/or parent workshops.   Key Areas of focus for Students as Learners:   1. In our efforts to support the focus of “engaging students in learning,” we as a staff strive to the following:   1. Incite curiosity in every child;   2. Equip each student with learning tools;   3. Provide opportunities for everyone to explore the richness and diversity of the world;    4. Celebrate the accomplishments of each child in her/his learning journey.   These goals embody what we believe to be at the heart of learning at MTW. Furthermore, they have allowed us to  authentically connect the Common Core Learning Standards, as well as the Danielson Framework, to our unique work.   Key Areas of focus involving parents:   ● To attend parent workshops . We believe it is important for parents to know how we educate their children. Parent  workshops are one way that allows us to do this. They also support parents in how they can support learning at home  as well as inform parents of curriculum and teaching.    ● To be involved in committees, parent/student events, or discussions/dialogues with the Principal and staff.   ● To be involved in community events . Every week we hold a community meeting (whole school) that involves  students and staff. Parents are able to attend. This event invites parents to be a part of the community in a  meaningful way.   ● To be involved in classrooms . All parents are invited into the school at arrival and dismissal. Parents are able to  come to the classroom (in early grades, into the classroom) to say good bye to their child. This fosters trust between  parent and teacher; it also demonstrates to all students how we consider parents to be co-participants in their child’s  education.      The CEP goals for the 2018/2019 school year:   1. By June 2019, 85% of students in grades K-5 will meet end-of-year grade-level benchmarks in mathematics as  evidenced by performance on a variety of measures including end-of-year assessments, Investigations end-of-unit  assessments, teacher developed assessments, and the NYS math test.   2. By June 2019, increase by 1-3 percentile points the Median Adjusted Growth Percentile for students who scored in  the lowest third in ELA as measured by the NYS ELA exam. Returning students in testing grades identified in the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      school’s lowest third in ELA will make progress above the citywide median. Collectively, they will average an adjusted  growth percentile in ELA of at least 59th.   3. By June 2019, 100% of classroom teachers will have participated in 2-3 cycles of team-based action-research that  result in findings (e.g., strategies, understandings, activities, etc.) disseminated to the teaching staff as a whole. These  teams will meet as inquiry teams at least once per month during common prep times, as measured by agendas,  minutes, and sign-in sheets from team meetings and documents disseminated to the teaching staff.   4. By June 2019, 100% of teachers will engage in professional development, inquiry, and discussions in order to  develop practices that support the social emotional development of all students. Teachers will identify challenges and  collaboratively explore strategies and interventions as described in resources such as Resolving Conflict Creatively ,  and The Responsive Classroom .   5. Over the course of the 2018/2019 academic year, staff at Midtown West School will continue to integrate STEM  (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) into their daily instructional practices as evidenced by the use of such  practices in lessons, student activities, and assessment and planning. As measured by the use of agendas and sign-in  sheets for professional development, classroom observations as documented in Advance, the increased  implementation of STEM practices will result in an increase in student learning.   Why these goals were created:   As a school community, we recognize that all school initiatives are connected – and dependent on – other school  initiatives. For example, by prioritizing high quality professional development, work around curriculum and  assessments evolved, as did participation in meaningful inquiry and collegial interactions. As time went on,  professional conversations reflected the new work, which in turn created a desire for more professional development.  All the while, student learning increased: group charts represent the distributive property of multiplication, student  book partner conversations involved the development of theories about characters, etc. Now that some teachers are  equipped with the understanding to lead their own professional development for colleagues, many of our 80 minutes  PD sessions on Mondays have been devoted to staff-led PD. As such, I am distributing leadership and building capacity  from within. In the framework developed to communicate our school wide priorities, the interdependency and inter- connectedness of everything is made explicit. When one component is improved, other components improve as well.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 02M212   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   366   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.        Midtown West’s overarching emphasis on the Framework for Teaching Engaging Students in Learning helps us to  organize an approach to curriculum centered on challenging content and complex thinking. The goal below – based on  the Framework for Great Schools – was developed over the course of the 2018/2019 school year in consultation with  staff, parents, and students whereby the nature of “rigorous learning” at Midtown West (MTW) was assessed through  various means. This needs assessment included but was not limited to regular and ongoing discussions at grade-level  meetings, loop-level meetings, inquiry meetings, professional development sessions, and faculty conferences. The  Principal’s observation process (based on Danielson’s Framework for Teaching) was a large contributor to the overall  assessment of classroom practices. In addition, teaching staff met one-on-one with the principal to reflect on  strengths and areas of growth. By means of parent feedback from Coffee & Conversation sessions with the principal,  as well as individual/small-group meetings with the principal, parents were provided regular opportunity to express  their perceived needs of the school. The School Leadership Team (SLT) engaged in regular needs-based discussions in  an attempt to provide positive direction for the school. Furthermore, the SLT participated in a learning walk in order  to identify elements of each CEP as they occur in the classroom. Throughout all of these needs-based practices,  increased attention to cognitive rigor has emerged as a shared priority for all constituent groups of MTW. Some of the  targets of this goal include the complexity of work asked of students, the rigor of this work, as well as the  appropriateness of the work in achieving learning goals for individual students. In addition to the increased attention  to further align teaching/learning to the CCLS, attention has also been given to documenting and recording cognitively  rigorous activities by means of detailed, grade/content specific pacing calendars.   Listed below are some findings based on feedback from our 2017/18 Principal Practice Observation, visits from  consultants/staff developers, and other data sources that detail areas in which Midtown West is working to improve:   *Increase academic rigor . As informed by the 2018/2019 Principal Practice Observation, teachers at Midtown West  strive to maximize the level of rigor of all instruction and learning activities.   ● Further foster student independence. As informed by the Principal Practice Observation, teachers at Midtown West  are working on providing all students with opportunities to appropriate learning across a variety of independent  activities.   ● Strategically use other adults. As informed by the Principal Practice Observation, Midtown West staff is strategizing  ways to ensure the effective and maximal use of all adults present in the classroom (paraprofessionals, student  teachers, etc.).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15      ● Strategically use instructional time. Midtown West staff are examining how to maximize all instructional time by  being aware of the length of minilessons, the use of differentiated learning, the use of small group instruction, and  how to maximize students’ “time on task.”   ● Through our professional development, staff are working on crafting a series of connected mini-lessons that work  together to support the learning objectives of all units of study.   ● Continue to create instructional and curricular cohesion.    ● Engage in rich tasks, not exercises .    The strengths of Midtown West School relative to the Framework’s element of Rigorous Instruction – and inferred  from the above data – are broad in scope. Based on these data, we have identified the following strengths for the  2018/2019 school year:   ● Collaboratively develop curriculum and activities to increase rigor;   ● Support parents in their role as participants in their child’s education .   The needs of Midtown West School relative to the Framework’s element of Rigorous Instruction – and inferred from  the above data – are broad in scope. Based on these data, we have identified the following priority needs for the  2017/2018 school year:   ● Continued Professional Development to support curricular cohesion    ● Leveraging schedules to support maximum use of all adults   ● Creating opportunities for parents to engage in the curriculum to support learning at home        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  The goal below – based on the Framework for Great Schools – was developed over the course of the 2017/18 school  year in consultation with staff, parents, and students whereby the nature of a “supportive environment” at Midtown  West (MTW) was assessed through various means. This needs assessment included but was not limited to regular and  ongoing discussions at grade-level meetings, loop-level meetings, professional development sessions, and faculty  conferences. The Principal's observation process (based on Danielson’s Framework for Teaching) was a large  contributor to the overall assessment of classroom practices. In addition, teaching staff met one-on-one with the  principal to reflect on strengths and areas of growth. By means of parent feedback from Coffee & Conversation  sessions with the principal, as well as individual/small-group meetings with the principal, parents were provided  regular opportunity to express their perceived needs of the school. The School Leadership Team (SLT) engaged in  regular needs-based discussions in an attempt to provide positive direction for the school. Furthermore, the SLT  participated in a learning walk in order to identify elements of each CEP as they occur in the classroom. Throughout all  of these needs-based practices, the Framework’s element of “Supportive Environment” has emerged as a shared  priority for all constituent groups of MTW.    Listed below are some findings based on feedback from visits from consultants/staff developers, and other data  sources that detail areas in which Midtown West is working to improve:    Further develop social/emotional curriculum across the grade levels     Forge greater connections between Community Meeting activities and classroom practices (as per Principal  Observation Practice)    Improve connections between recess time and the physical education curriculum (as per School Wellness Council)    Explore potential of School Wellness Council initiatives such as Sustainability programs, healthy eating, etc.     Midtown West continues to utilize opportunities to collaborate with co-located school (PPAS).    Further improve school-wide procedure/protocols for class reps to improve communication between class and  home.

The principal’s classroom observation process (based on Danielson’s Framework for  Teaching) is a large contributor to the overall assessment of teaching practices. The one-on-one conference with the  principal is in fact a "needs assessment" in itself as staff come prepared to share with the leadership their questions,  goals, values, and aspirations for the school, including their ideas as to how the school could perform better. The  School Leadership Team (SLT) engages in regular needs-based discussions in order to provide positive direction for the  school. Furthermore, the SLT participates in a yearly learning walk in order to identify key elements of each CEP as  they occur in the classrooms. Throughout all of these needs-based practices, the Framework’s element of  Collaborative Teachers remains a shared priority for all constituent groups of MTW.    Feedback from these interactions, visits from consultants/staff developers, and other data sources detail areas in  which Midtown West will continue to work to improve:   *Align practices of all teachers to strengthen school wide instructional   cohesion around our social studies-based curriculum    * Nurture a culture of rigor and respect for all constituents   her data sources detail  areas in which Midtown West will continue to work to improve:  Align practices of all teachers to strengthen school wide instructional  cohesion around our social  studies-based curriculum  Nurture a culture of rigor and respect for all constituents       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

NA        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Midtown West, P.S 212, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.S 212 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  In addition to the NYSESLAT/NYSITELL, teachers use data gathered from the Fountas & Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System  (BAS), Qualitative Reading Inventory, TCRWP and various formative assessments (e.g. reading behavior checklists,  conferencing notes, etc.)  to assess the early literacy skills of our students. The data gathered with these methods are  particularly informative of the reading, writing, speaking and listening skills of our ELLs. More often than not, ELLs at the lower  levels of English proficiency perform below their peers in the four modalities.  Our Academic Intervention Team (AIT) is  monitoring the students we are concerned about and providing our teachers with strategies to support them in the classroom.  Small group interventions, including Orton-Gillingham based programs, are underway to support our ELLs needing Tier 2 and  Tier 3 support for literacy development.           2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         ENL teachers meet with individual teachers as well as in loops to discuss student needs and plan accordingly.  They are looped  into daily and weekly plans so they can support students with their day-to-day academics.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of the ELL program is determined by students’ progress on classroom assessments and the number of students  advancing on the NYSESLAT.  We have also developed grade-level, English language benchmarks based on the New Language  Arts Progressions that assist us in progress monitoring and instructional planning.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    ENL teachers meet with the AIT (Academic Intervention Team), classroom teachers and support staff to assess the data for  skills mastered and plan further interventions for ones still in progress.  AIT grade teams and ENL teacher meets with  classroom teachers during scheduled AIT meetings and monthly Monday staff developments for dissemination of information.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   For each ELL who scores below specified levels of performance on the NYSESLAT and/or classroom assessments, the school's  AIT (Academic Intervention Team) in conjunction with the ENL and classroom teacher determines what support services need  to be provided to the student. Strong core instruction for ELLs in English language development is provided at Tier 1. At Tier 1,  the AIT and ENL teachers provide suggestions for classroom supports that can be given by the teacher.  These are then  assessed after a six-week period.  Students move into Tier 2 and Tier 3 if they demonstrate a need for more targeted and  intensive academic support based on the assessments given and data compared by ENL and classroom teachers. This extra  support commonly occurs in small groups with instruction focused on specific learning targets highlighted as areas of need  from the assessments. Tier 2 and Tier 3 instruction is tailored to meet ELLs’ language needs and is based on research-based  intervention strategies.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Along with the NYSESLAT data, we also use school developed grade-level, English language benchmarks based on the New  Language Arts Progressions that assist us in progress monitoring and instructional planning.  The outcomes of these  assessments guide us in deciding the direction of supports for individual students.  The outcomes from this data along with the results of the Fountas & Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System (BAS), Qualitative  Reading Inventory, TCRWP and various formative assessments (e.g. reading behavior checklists, conferencing notes,  etc.)  guides the AIT, ENL and classroom teachers in deciding, not only supports within the classroom in Tier I, but also if and  when students need to move beyond Tier I into II & III and possibly an evaluation because we  believe there is a connection  between their disabilities and their language acquisition potential.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Teachers have weekly loop and grade planning meetings to discuss assessments and student progress with the  ENL teacher  and AIT grade leads.  Monthly AIT meetings are set at the beginning of the year so that the team can meet with classroom  teachers to discuss assessments and student progress and make adjustments as needed.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Depending on English proficiency level, ELLs require anywhere from 90 to 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week.  Students are grouped by grade and proficiency levels. The maximum allowable grade span for grouping instruction in  ENL is two contiguous grades. Instruction is delivered through standalone ENL, which is when students are pulled out  and specific skills are targeted based on assessments and integrated ENL, where ENL support is given to support the  curriculum/lessons currently happening within the classroom. Proficiency level determines what combination of the  two types is provided (e.g. Beginners receive 180 minutes of standalone and 180 minutes of integrated). Standalone  ENL is delivered in small groups in a separate location. Integrated ENL is delivered in the classroom using a co- teaching or parallel teaching model.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     n/a      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      n/a     2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Our school will follow the mandated ENL units as stipulated in CR Part 154.  Beginner/Entering:  360 total minutes, 180 standalone ENL, 180 integrated ENL/ELA, 90  Low Intermediate/Emerging:  360 total minutes, 90 standalone ENL, 180 integrated ENL/ELA, 90 Flexibilitly, Standalone or  Integrated ENL/ELA  Intermediate/Transitioning:  180 total minutes, 90 standalone ENL, 90 integrated ENL/ELA, Flexibility, standalone or Integrated  ENL/ELA  Advanced/Expanding:  180 integrated ENL/ELA, or other content area  Proficient/Commanding:  90 integrated ENL/ELA, or other content area  Supports available for former English language learners, NY State requires 90 minutes per week of integrated ENL instruction  for two years after a student test out of the program. Academic Intervention Services (AIS), content area support, ENL  instruction or regular consultation between the ENL teacher and main stream teachers may be included as part of the services.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      For Freestanding ENL, our only program model, all lesson plans include both content and language objectives. The language  objectives specifically address the needs of the ELLs. The primary goal of the program is to amplify the literacy and  cognitive/academic skills of all ELLs by incorporating recognized and researched based ENL instructional strategies across  content areas. ENL strategies include but are not limited to: scaffolding, songs and chants, repetition, graphic organizers (i.e.  tables, flowcharts, graphs and story maps), modeling, interactive read alouds, language rich experiences, accountable talk, and  audio/visual support. Our balanced literacy and math workshop models meet the demands of the Common Core Learning  Standards and are utilized to support the content areas. The balanced literacy approach to reading and writing allows for a  strong emphasis on vocabulary development. The teachers at MTW are trained to help the students learn the difference  between social and academic language. They strive to be appropriate language models who continuously engage students in  the content areas through differentiated instruction and the activation of prior knowledge.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   ENL and AIT teachers find resources, such as dual language texts, translated text/videos and music to support students and  give them the opportunity to access the information in their native language.  Evaluation comes from observations of student  work/conversations and conversations with parents.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Every student is different. How we differentiate is based on individual needs. Instructional decisions are made after reviewing  assessments and observations. Having said that, here are some typical differentiation examples for each ELL subgroup:  (a). SIFE students - We don't have any students with interrupted formal education, but in the event that we do, a plan of action  based on individual needs would be implemented.    (b) Newcomers - Small group instruction with language support is provided. Listening comprehension is emphasized by using  read-alouds and music. We use visuals and have students point to pictures or act out vocabulary. It is important to speak  slowly and use shorter words. Gesturing as much as possible helps as well.  (c). Developing - The strategies above are continued, but more academic language is introduced. Students are supported with  graphic organizers and prompting. Scaffolds are given to encourage responses with explanation and justification. A lot of work  is done around vocabulary development to support their transition through the stages of language development.   (c). Long Term - These students are in testing grades, so accommodations are put in place to help them succeed. These include  directions read, extra time, separate location and small groups. Differentiation strategies like those used for newcomers and  developing ELLs are built upon. Long term ELLs should be approaching native fluency, so instruction supports filling in the gaps  and offering challenges.   (e) Former ELLs - Differentiation tactics should be applied as they would for any student. Considering their former ELL  designation, access to and use of English should be a priority when making instructional decisions.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   When considering ELLs who have IEPs, multiple modalities for learning must be considered. Most students in this subgroup  benefit from visual supports. This includes graphic organizers, color or picture coded charts, non-verbal cues, videos, etc.  Technology plays a role here too, as we use iPad apps and the Attainment Workstation (computer program) to support  language development. The use of technology with effective programs provide individualize instruction and opportunities to  practice in various context.  It also provides the ability to work at their own pace.  Audiobooks are also very helpful. They are  used at all grade levels, particularly lower grades, to support reading and exposure to English. Native languages are  incorporated where appropriate, like when the students write fiction and non-fiction dual-language books. They help support  the language transition, but also give students the opportunity to celebrate their home languages. Because most ELLs with IEPs  also receive related services, it is imperative that the staff meet to develop schedules and discuss goals. In the past we had  beginning ELLs who also receive SETSS, Speech, OT, PT and Counseling. In these cases, it is vital that we monitor the mandates  and find ways to support each other's work.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Teachers and service providers are creative in their planning to ensure that ELL-SWDs are participating in the general  education curriculum with their non-disabled peers. When appropriate, service providers and/or ENL teachers will push into  the classroom, supporting the students with the lesson taking place at that time. At other times, when the students need to  pulled out, the service providers/teachers reinforce what their colleagues are doing with the student, or they give the student  tools/strategies to carry over into the classroom.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  All students, including ELLs, go through the RTI process. We have targeted interventions for each tier and subject area. Most of  these interventions are ways teachers can differentiate the general education curriculum to support their ELLs and ELL-SWDs   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      (See Part V). One specific program for reading intervention we use is Fountas and Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention, which  is geared towards the lower grades. We also have teachers trained in the Wilson Reading System and other Orton-Gillingham  based programs. Math, social studies and science remediation is provided for prospective students in small groups.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      The school has purchased an updated math curriculum, Investigations, which has a newly written ENL component for teachers,  as well as, the Teacher's College reading and writing curriculum and staff development which has an ENL component as well.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None at this time, other than outdated procedures non-compliant with CR-154.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded the same access to school programs as any other child. Students are offered before school support around  literacy and math.  Translation and interpretation services are provided to ensure that parents are aware of available  opportunities.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Math: manipulatives, games, reckenreck, beadstrings, supplemental units, and development of school-wide mathematical  vocabulary.  Science/Social Studies: field trips, computers, hands-on materials, and experiential learning.  Literacy: iPad apps, word walls, language games, frequent discourse, book partnerships, books on tape, dual-language books  and teacher/student conferencing.  Specifics regarding differentiation and supports for subgroups can be found in Part V.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   ENL is our only program model, so home language is used where applicable. Students are encouraged to see connections  between their home languages in order to better understand how languages are structured and organized. Students explore  their home language to see how it is the same and different from English (Are there words that sound the same and mean the  same thing? Are there words that sound the same but mean different things?). We have seen success writing dual-language  books in English-Spanish to help foster these connections.  Students are given resources such as dual-language texts,  translated texts/videos and music in their native language.  The information is assessed through classroom work, observations  and conversations with parents.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All TESOL teachers are aware of the procedures and mandates outlined in CR-154. In addition, all teachers are expected to  know the Common Core Standards and New Language Arts Progressions. ENL teachers meet with and get weekly plans from all  grade teachers so that they are sure that their resources and services are grade and age appropriate. Systems are in place to  ensure that every ELL receives the minimal instructional time mandated by CR-154.          15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We share a co-location with a middle school/high school but do not coordinate efforts.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Assistance to newly enrolled ELLs and their families is provided by the LAC, ENL teacher, Parent Coordinator and PTA. In  addition to the required parent orientation and tour, given by teachers and the Parent Coordinator, various parent workshops   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         given by teachers and the Parent Coordinator and social events, provided by the PTA take place regularly. Our guidance  counselor is available for transitional difficulty if needed.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    There are no language electives offered at this elementary school. We have a Spanish club that meet once a week.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   n/a       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  ELL personnel will attend language acquisition professional development offered through the Department of Education as per  their academic calendar and Teachers College, which occur throughout the year. Teachers are permitted to attend any  relevant workshops that will support their work with our ELL population.   Teachers of ELLs are offered professional development on-site, through the city and at Teachers College that is dedicated to  language acquisition.  Professional development includes workshops around testing, phonics, and word study.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The ENL teachers, LAC and parent coordinator work with ELLs, their families and their teachers to assist in middle school  planning. Parents are given school recommendations aligned to language program needs. Parents are also given a list of  relevant questions to ask as they embark on middle school tours.   MTW provides over 50 days of on-site professional development to the staff per year. Attendance and agendas are saved from  each workshop. 15% of the PD for all teachers is dedicated to language acquisition and best practices for integrated ENL. In  addition to the on-site PD, the ENL teachers are sent out to workshops relevant to their expertise (50% of all their PD is  dedicated to language acquisition). Those teachers turnkey the workshops to the whole staff.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In addition to parent/teacher conferences, ENL teachers meet with parents at least once a year to discuss language  development progress, assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. Translation and/or  interpretation services are provided through the T&I Unit when needed.  Parents are invited to meetings through email,  newsletters, and phone calls.  The meetings include the classroom teacher, ENL teacher and any other support teachers who  work with the child.  If parents cannot attend the meeting, conference calls, or emails are set up to allow the conversation to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59            happen.  Goals and an action plan to meet them are created by teachers and students prior to the meeting and communicated  to the parents during those meetings   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Response for #2: For every face-to-face meeting with parents, an attendance form is signed and detailed notes are recorded.  These are retained in the student's cumulative folder. All other interactions (e.g. phone calls, emails) are recorded as well. See  Part IV, questions 4-10 for more information about communication and retainment of records.  The PTA also schedules several  Cultural Pot Luck celebrations to bring in the ELL parent population.     Response for #3: We have a high level of parent involvement at our school. This benefits our ELL families tremendously. Parent  involvement is fostered by the PTA, our staff and our school community as a whole.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kathleen Loua, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Midtown West School                                                                              School DBN: 02M212  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
