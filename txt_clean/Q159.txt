This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our Vision at P.S. 159 is a true partnership of administrators, teachers, school staff, students, and parents all working  together toward the same goal. We want our students to be independent, lifelong learners who have the essential  skills to succeed in today’s society and to become responsible members of our global world.   Our mission is to achieve this vision by creating a safe and stimulating educational environment for our students.  Through our commitment to Common Core Learning Standards based instruction and the values of a multi-ethnic,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      democratic society, our dedicated school staff works diligently to provide our students with an exciting and rigorous  instructional program.                   2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P.S. 159 Q is a vibrant school that is housed in a three-story U-shaped brick structure built in 1931 and sits in the  middle of Bayside, a neighborhood of modest, middle-class private homes.   Our educational program meets all the Common Core requirements of literacy, mathematics, social studies, science  and the arts. The integration of technology and providing effective remediation, enrichment and extra-curricular  programs are part of our goal in meeting the needs of all the students in our school.   For the 2018-2019 school year, we will continue implementing Teachers College Reading and Writing Project, Math  Exemplars as an additional mathematical assessment to develop critical thinking and reasoning skills to solve real- world problems. In addition, we plan on deepening our teachers' knowledge of content and pedagogy on the new  Social Studies curriculum, Passport to Social Studies.    Teachers in Kindergarten through Grade 5 use the Teachers College Units of Study in Opinion/Argument,  Informational, and Narrative Writing. Two years ago, we partnered with TCRWP as a project school. We are thrilled to  continue working with staff developers from Teachers College and are looking forward to attending calendar days at  TC. The TC curriculum fosters higher-level thinking through regular opportunities to synthesize, analyze, and critique  writing, and build writing independence and fluency in our students. Teachers embed test sophistication within their  literacy teaching by supplementing with correlating NY Ready reading lessons.   We provide additional instruction in vocabulary building and word study skills through the implementation of the  Wordly Wise program for Grades 3-5. The Fundations phonics program is used with our K-2 students. Students with  disabilities are provided with additional support in decoding and fluency through Wilson Reading. Our English  Language Learners (ELLs) are supported by their classroom teacher, who is dually licensed (General  Education/Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL). For our ELLs that have scored at the  Entering/Emerging level on the New York State Identification Test for English Language Learners (NYSITELL) or the  New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) these students are provided with  additional support by our ELL coordinator.We also have these students utilize Imagine Learning Licenses.          The Go Math! program has a strong emphasis on constructivist learning which focuses on students’ conceptual  understanding of mathematical ideas and concepts. We provide additional instruction around problem solving using  the “Exemplars” Math program to differentiate instruction for our students and increase the level of rigor that takes  place in our daily math lessons. Next year, our school's Instructional Focus will be on assessment and how teachers  can use assessment in order to drive all aspects of their instruction while also tailoring and differentiating tasks for  students based upon their mathematical ability.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Our Science Program emphasizes a hands-on inquiry based approach to learning where students construct their  understanding of the natural world through problem solving and active exploration. A full time science cluster teacher  who provides hands-on activities in a fully equipped science room supports our science program.   The Arts program at P.S. 159 offers instruction in the Visual, Performing, and Musical Arts. Our third through fifth  grade students perform at our annual Spring Choral Concert. Students in kindergarten and first grade participate in  interactive learning in music by singing, dancing and playing instruments; students in second and third grade learn  how to play the recorder and perform for their parents in the Spring; fourth and fifth grade students learn how to play  the guitar, drums and keyboard for which students collaborate in each lesson to create a musical piece. Our school  partnered with CASA for an after school program in order to provide our students in grades three through five with an  artistic cultural experience through teaching artists.       During the 2018-2019 school year, our school is excited to introduce a full-time STEM (Science, Technology,  Engineering, and Math) teacher to our building. Our STEM teacher's role will be to support our classroom teachers'  and students through designing a STEM curriculum that is tailored to the grade specific standards and programs. This  robust curriculum will promote rigorous learning and higher order thinking. Students in Kindergarten will be working  with Code and Go mice. First and second grade students will be using Wonderbots and Dash and Dots. Third grade will  utilize Little Bits and Fourth and Fifth grade learners will work with Lego Robotics.       Our building is ‘wireless’ and all classrooms have Internet capability. We have laptop carts and iPad carts that the  students utilize in their classrooms to support the various units of study. Promethean Staff Developers train teachers  on the use of Interactive Promethean Boards, which are in all classrooms. In addition, all classroom teachers have  document cameras that are utilized to aid in the facilitation of their instruction. Students in Kindergarten have Smart  tables in their classrooms that help to increase engagement.   At P.S. 159, we are strong believers in recognizing student achievement and celebrating the success of our students.  Two students of the month are chosen from each class and their pictures are displayed in the main lobby. The art  teacher also chooses an artist of the month, whose artwork, photo and biography are displayed in the school lobby.  We have class performances throughout the year and student work is beautifully displayed around the school. The  Celebration of Learning, is an annual curriculum fair that showcases each students' learning process and  achievements during the year. The Celebration of Learning has become a tradition in our school. It is an event that all  P.S. 159 stakeholders look forward to each year.    We, at PS 159, are committed to addressing the emotional, social and academic needs of every child. This year, we  have introduced the Sanford Harmony Social and Emotional program. This is a school wide programs that spans from  Pre-Kindergarten to Fifth Grade. The program is designed to improve student cooperation, collaboration, and  problem solving. Research supports the fact that the program reduces teasing, bullying, and aggression. Additionally,  the program builds trust and encourages connection and empathy. There is also resources that aid in parent outreach  and communication.         Another initiative at P.S. 159 includes our Peer-Tutoring program. Peers work together during their lunch time to form  bonds while sharpening their study skills.   We recognize the importance of working closely with our administrators, teachers, students and their families, as well  as with outreach organizations, as we strive to have every child achieve his or her potential.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         We have a structure in place for all educational staff to share strategies and best practices through our monthly  school-wide liaison team meetings. We have liaisons in literacy, math, English as a New Language, and Special  Education.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our vertical liaison teams will meet throughout the school year in order to share out best practices and engage in  inquiry work cycles. The liaisons will meet to look at student work, determine a need among the learners, and then try  out different strategies to help that pre-determined group of learners make progress. In order to meet the specific  learning needs of all of our learners (ELLS, FELLs, SWDs, and enrichment students), we have formed an English  Language Learner liaison team, a Special Education liaison team, a mathematics liaison team, and a Literacy liaison  team.             4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Areas of Growth During the Previous Year       During the 2017-2018 school year, our school continued to make growth, as it had in the previous year, 2016-2017, in  the area of English as a New Language (ENL). We decided to focus on this population of students as they historically  have not made as much progress as our non-ELL population. In addition, this population of learners have been a  district-wide focus. We incorporated the arts within the classroom and outside of the classroom.         After the Framework for Great Schools report, our school made the most growth in the area of trust. The most  significant areas of growth in this area were made between the parents and teachers and parents to principal in the  area of trust. During the 2017-2018 school year, we plan on working to increase the level of trust between our  teachers.                      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 26Q159   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   678   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 159Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS159Q will support parents and families:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s programs. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Parent Involvement Policy, parents of participating students, parent members of the school’s Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were  consulted on the proposed Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To  increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  programs as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s  Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as described  in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and  ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

DiDio has determined that the Title III afterschool program designed  specifically for ELLS has had a positive impact on their learning of the English Language as  evident in the NYSESLAT scores. During the 2018-2019 school year we will extend our  program to support all of our English Language Learners in grades K-5, including long term  ELLs, newcomers, and SWD/ELL's.    We will have 6 group's: 1 Kindergarten group, 1 group for Grades 1, 1 group for Grade 2, 1  group for Grades 3, 1 group for Grade 4, and 1 group for Grade 5.    Grade K has  students (4 Entering, 5 Emerging, 6 Transitioning, 6 Expanding).   Grade 1 has students (2 Entering, 0 Emerging, 5 Transitioning,  20 Expanding).  Grade 2  has students (3 Entering, 1 Emerging, 3 Transitioning, 14 Expanding).  Grade 3 has students  students (2 Entering, 5 Emerging, 1 Transitioning, 10 Expanding).  Grade 4 has  students (0 Entering, 2 Emerging, 3 Transitioning, 7 Expanding).   Grade 5 has students (1 Entering, 4 Emerging, 0 Transitioning, 7 Expanding).       The 6 teachers are dually licensed in English as a New Language (ENL) and Elementary  Education, formally known as Common Branch.   The program goals are to prepare students to  meet the English as a New Language Standards as demonstrated through the NYSESLAT  results, in addition to meeting the Common Core Learning Standards for reading, writing,  listening, and speaking.         The program will run on Wednesdays and Thursdays for 20 sessions. The program will begin  on January 10th, 2019 and end on March 28th, 2019.  P.S.159 offers all ENL programs as per the  Parent Choice Surveys.  Therefore, all instruction will be in English. However, we will offer  native language support through Imagine Learning software licenses and translation  services/interpreters.  Student dictionaries and glossaries will also be available in all languages  for student use in school and at home.       The program will utilize the new Common Core NYSESLAT test sophistication materials  that are supplemental and distinct from those used in daily instruction. In addition, teachers will  utilize leveled libraries, non-fiction articles and books, and the use of thinking maps to support  writing.  Technology materials include use of Promethean boards, iPads, and laptops to access  Pebblego.com (nonfiction articles in an audio format for use at home and school), Imagine  Learning (individualized program with native language support to target phonemic awareness,  comprehension, vocabulary and fluency), BrainPop, Brain Pop Jr., Brain Pop for ELLs, and  video streaming from Discovery Education (supports nonfiction concepts through video).         The Title III  program will be inclusive to all ELL students, including long term ELLs,  SWDs, and newcomers. Families will receive invitations to have their children enrolled in the  program through letters that will be sent home in their preferred language of communication.  Records for the program will be maintained through agendas and excel spread sheets of  attendance. There will be flexible grouping to support individual student needs and to ensure all  students are receiving small group instruction based on school-wide/classroom data and  NYSESLAT results from the prior school year.  Small group instruction will be used throughout  the program in order to maximize English language acquisition.  Content will be delivered with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   appropriate ELL teaching scaffolds. Teachers will use realia, videos, and explicit vocabulary  instruction to ensure that ELLs are able to access content knowledge. Close readings and  questioning/discussion will be used with sentence frames. Students will be engaged in group  discussions, as well as, turn and talk opportunities. Interactive Read Alouds and Shared Reading  will also allow for students to participate orally in a shared reading experience.  Visual supports,  Total Physical Response (TPR) and Thinking Maps will be used to support our students and  allow for Multiple Entry Points throughout the lessons.   Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:                  Providing a collaborative environment where professional training, administrative support  and empowerment of teachers within the school is essential to attracting/retaining highly  qualified teachers and supporting all teachers to ensure they become highly qualified.  High  quality Professional Development assists all teachers in providing effective instruction for  ELLs.         Our school has formed the English as a New Language (ENL) liaison team. This is a vertical  team of teachers who come together to discuss the curriculum, how to differentiate the  curriculum for their ELLs, and the Title III program. In addition, the ENL liaison team meets to  turn-key any out of school professional development they have received from the Queens North  Field Support Center.  These workshops are being offered free of charge to the schools and the  Field Center is covering the cost of the per-diem substitute.  We have designated a lead person  for ENL liaison who will be trained to lead the liaison professionally.  The leader of the  liaison will keep a binder with all the agendas for the meetings along with sign in sheets for the  participants to ensure that everyone has received the information.  ENL liaison meetings will  meet every month to discuss the current status of ELLs and how to differ or strengthen our  instruction.  Based on these meetings, the administrative team may invite an out of the building  personnel to come in and do a professional development to meet the needs of our ENL educators  or send our teachers for further professional development/training.  We believe that the  frequent training, professional development, and providing opportunities for teachers to meet and  discuss their concerns with administrative team is essential in promoting a well developed  environment for educators as well as our ELL population.  This high quality training will have a  lasting impact on the teacher effectiveness and performance.      Teachers to be trained - All pedagogues, paraprofessionals and support staff are provided with  appropriate ongoing PD.  The ENL Coordinator will have an ENL Liaison Team that will meet  on a monthly basis for specific ENL professional development. This ENL liaison team will meet  in the beginning of the year in order to determine an inquiry focus for the school year. Every  month, the team will meet to analyze student work samples, discuss strategies and best practices,  and develop a focused plan with frequent opportunities for reflection and revision.    Schedule and duration/Topics To Be Covered - Pedagogues attend Professional Development  every Monday. Administration and staff work together to ensure that this time is used to meet the  needs of our staff and students.  The staff has created a list of topics to use as a menu throughout   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         Part C: Professional Development   the year.

These workshops are mostly monthly and cyclical. They are full day sessions or half day  sessions.  Staff also participates in Professional Development scheduled by Queens North  Borough Field Support Center. Grades meet weekly during common preps and our Tuesday  Professional Work Time.  During this time, Professional Development takes place to target grade  specific needs. Our Literacy Coach will be attending grade meetings and Professional Work  Time meetings to support our Reading and Writing Units of Study. Our Teachers College  Facilitator also offer school-wide support through labsites.  These labsites highlight and share  best practices and support collaborative planning and teacher reflection.

Communicating  with parents in both Native and English Language is key to welcoming, informing, and  encouraging parent involvement.   Schedule and duration - Parent-Teacher conferences are held and translators are provided.  Report cards are distributed in the home language when available. Additionally, teachers  communicate throughout the year with parents using written translations or oral interpreters, as  needed on an individual basis. Bilingual staff are available for these meetings.  Our staff can  communicate in Korean, Mandarin, Cantonese, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Greek, Punjabi,  Urdu, and Hebrew. Meetings can be held before, during or after school. Parents are also  encouraged to bring their own translators (fluent in their dialect and language) to meetings,  conferences and other activities. For additional languages we use the NYC DOE Translation and  Interpretation Unit. Our staff has been introduced to an application (app) called Remind. This  app allows teachers to send out reminders that can be translated into 70 different  languages.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  At P.S. 159 we are currently using Teachers College in grades K-5.  We have analyzed the Reading level data that is gathered  from Running Records and analyzed pre/post assessments. We determined that our ELLs are not making the same progress in  Reading and Writing as our non-ELLs.  We have also used our NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data to provide insights about our  ELLs and notice the struggle to make progress in the reading and writing components and often perform better in the listening  and speaking.  Therefore we are providing addition AIS supports with two teachers this school year, and looking at this as part  of our inquiry focus for the year.   In the early childhood grades we are also using Fundations at P.S.159 will receive whole  group and small group instruction utilizing these literacy tools.  In addition, we also utilize Imagine Learning which provides  ongoing data of our students progress and tailors computer-based instruction for the individual students. The data gathered  from all formative assessments is used to plan small group instruction.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      Two years ago, we decided to conduct an in-depth study on ELLs through our participation in the CAHN Fellowship. Our  research determined that in order for ELLs to make progress in Reading and Writing, they must first become comfortable to  express themselves. Our work was rooted in listening and speaking. We conducted professional development sessions on how  to raise the comfort of our ELLs through the arts. In addition, we also had an after school arts program. The strategies that the  teaching artist utilized was shared out with our ELL teachers. Since the first arts session was so successful, we decided to  implement a second session. After comparing the listening and speaking data from the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, and classroom  data,  we could see growth in both of these areas so we therefore set forth to focus on Reading and Writing.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Allison Myers, our Literacy Coach, supports teachers in their work with Teacher's College.  Teachers are also sent to Teacher's  College workshops throughout the school year.  Information obtained at these professional developments are turn- keyed at  our grade meetings and vertical team meetings.    Melissa Delmonte our ELL Coordinator/Teacher leads our ELL Liason Team to meet with all our ELL teachers to discuss and  evaluate our ELLs' individual needs and how to best support these students.  This year our ELL team will plan an inquiry  focus  that will be used for both our vertical team and on the grade level.  The team will meet monthly to review and discuss  findings from each grade level an determine next steps.  Teachers of ELLs also will continute to meet together to share  resources and best practices to support ELLs of all proficiency levels.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Each year as a school, we look at the individual growth of each of our students and reflect on our programs and methods of  instruction. As we utilize data from the EDAT and  NYSITELL/NYSESLAT scores, ELA/MATH State assessments, TC Running  Records and Fundations, We continuously track data to determine the success of our programs and make any changes we find  necessary for the success of our ELL population.     We exercise a focused effort to address our ELL students.  We have staffed our school to have three licensed Early  Childhood/ENL teachers for kindergarten and two licensed Common Branch/ENL licensed teachers in grades K-5. This structure  allows for daily use of ENL methodologies from the classroom teacher throughout the entire school day.  In addition,  Melissa  Delmonte our ENL Coordinator/Teacher  is licensed in Early Childhood, Common Branch and ENL.  Mrs.  Delmonte provides support to our entire ELL community.   Our supports are targeted to ensure that our students will show a  greater increase in their NYSESLAT results and all classroom assessments, as well as standardized tests.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Interventions that are needed based on summative data is addressed by both our ELL Coordinator/Teacher Melissa  Delmonte and our SBST.  Either Mrs. Delmonte or an AIS provider will meet with struggling students to provide additional  supports in addition to the classroom teachers small group and one on one instruction.    Mrs. Delmonte services our Entering & Emerging ELLS, along with our ELLS/SWDs population.  She also will include students  that are identified by the EDAT, classroom teachers, or SBST as needing additional AIS services in her pull out or push in  programs.  Students will receive targeted instruction to support skills or strategies needed in the classroom.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   P.S.159 analyzes Teachers College running records throughout the year to select English Language learners who need  additional support.    This year we will also have two AIS providers working with our students.  We utilized both the Math and ELA scores,  NYSESLAT scores, and the EDAT to determine which ELLs would benefit from additional support.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         Using the information from the EDAT (which includes NYSESLAT, ELA and Math data) we can evaluate and inform our ELL  programs of areas of need of targeted instruction and areas in which we are doing well.  For kindergarten we also look at the  NYSITELL data and classroom assessments to plan for instruction.  When utilizing the EDAT we look at the risk factors to plan  for instruction.  For example if a student is determined to be having difficulty in writing, teachers and support personal will  create lessons and units to support that skill.  Also students who have shown no progress or dropped a level in the  NYSESLAT will be monitored to determine what specific skills and strategies will best support that individual child's language  needs.  The ELA and Math scores also provide information to determine students who need AIS support and what skills should  be retaught and reviewed both during AIS, small group work and whole class instruction.  This information will be utilized  when planning our inquiry foci for the 2017-2018 school year in all vertical teams (ELL, Literacy, Math, Special Education).     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Our ELL Liason team meets and analyses the data from the EDAT along with grade meetings and individual teacher meetings  with Mrs. Delmonte the ELL Coordinator/Teacher and classroom dually licensed teachers.  Administration and our Literacy  Coach also meets with our ELL team to discuss findings and support any adjustments needed in our instructional  practice.  Throughout the year we will choose inquiry foci to deepen our understanding of the struggles our students are faced  with and which instructional practices best support their needs.  The inquiry work will be shared both vertically with all grades  alone with grade level teams.  All teachers, even teachers without ELLs will be involved in the inquiry work to determine any  adjustments to our programs that are needed.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   For our integrated ENL Program, in all grades K-5 we have dual licensed teachers in the classroom.  On the K level, we  have 3 dual licensed teachers and for grades 1-5, we have 2 dual licensed teachers per grade.  For our stand alone  program, we have one ENL provider, Melissa Delmonte.  Groups are arranged in NYSESLAT Testing grade bands-i.e. K,  1/2, 3/4 and 5.  Groups are heterogeneous including entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding, and commanding  students.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?    Melissa Delmonte delivers Stand Alone ENL to support ongoing development of reading, writing, listening and speaking with  a  focus on strengthening vocabulary in order for students to succeed in core content courses. During Integrated ENL  instruction, students will continue to develop language skills through content area instruction. A schedule was made with  school administration based on CR Part   154-2 ENL Units of Study and Staffing Requirements.  Students are receiving the following: Entering 180 minutes Stand Alone;  Emerging 90 minutes Stand Alone.  Being that our school is set up with dual licensed teachers, on every grade, we are  providing our learners with more than the mandated units and thus providing them with additional support.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Core Content Instruction is delivered in Stand Alone ENL and Integrated ENL by focusing on the Scope and Sequence for  Science and Social Studies in addition to the CCLS and the ENL Standards for Reading, Writing, Listening and Speaking. The  curriculum followed includes Teachers College Reading and Writing Units and GO Math.  Instruction is in English.  Students  work in flexible groups, with partners and one to one to support ongoing language development. A variety of methodologies  will be utilized to make content comprehensible such as scaffolding, TPR, realia, visual supports, and fiction and nonfiction  read alouds.  Glossaries and picture dictionaries are provided as native language support for the content areas.  Classroom  teachers are dual licensed and incorporate their own strategies to allow access to content area support for ELLs.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   ELLs are instructed in English and teachers use a variety of scaffolds, multiple entry points, and differentiation. Students are  provided with word glossaries on classroom tests.  For NYS Math exams, students receive translated versions in their home  language or are provided with an oral translator.  During all meetings with parents/guardians, translators are made available in  order to help our families communicate any questions, concerns, and/or suggestions that they might have. ELLs are provided  with home language instructional support through the Imagine Learning program. The Imagine Learning program offers data  on students' progress in comprehension, vocabulary acquisition, decoding, and other word work strategies. In addition,  students are further supported through; bilingual glossaries, and bilingual staff members to support these students throughout  the year. Bilingual paras and staff will use the child's home language to continue to support and evaluate as needed as well as  check in to evaluate learning in a variety of settings when applicable.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Instruction is differentiated depending on the students individualized performance level in addition to their current level of  performance based on classroom data. Instruction is designed to have multiple entry points for students of all levels and  provide opportunities for independent practice and increased levels of student engagement. Newcomers are exposed to  introductory vocabulary to support content area instruction with use of a variety of scaffolds, visuals, realia, TPR, sentence  frames and modeling language.  Students are also given partners that can assist in native language support as needed.  As  students develop more language and become Developing ELLs, these strategies will continue to be utilized and students will be  given additional opportunities to expand on their thinking and can serve as models for their classmates.  Thinking Maps are  used with students at all levels; (including Newcomers, Developing, Long-Term and Former ELLs,) with color coding and visuals  depending on their individual needs.  Paper choice, learning centers, and activities are created to support all learners on all  levels mentioned above,  both in the classroom and with service providers.  We currently do not have any SIFE students but  should one arrive we are prepared to meet their unique learning needs.  We would ensure that this population of students  receives the mandated servicing in addition to possible Academic Intervention Services (AIS).  As per CR Part 154.2, mandated  services for Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status are in place, as per CR Part 154.2 and these students are  placed with dual licensed  teachers with ENL strategies embedded.  Test accommodations for ELLs and Former ELLs include  time 1/2, glossaries, and a separate location.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   At P.S.159 we use a variety or instructional strategies and grade level materials to provide access to academic  content.  Teachers College Units and Go Math materials used in addition to Fundations (Grade K-2) and Wordly Wise (Grade 2- 5) for academic vocabulary.  We also use Language Power with grades 3-5 to support content vocabulary through a thematic  unit approach.  Some instructional strategies include modeling language, TPR, realia, visuals, interactive read alouds and close   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      reading.  Teachers also use a variety of technology such as Imagine Learning for one on one, small group or whole group  instruction, Brain Pop, and other video resources to support content area instruction.  Teachers utilize thinking maps, leveled  nonfiction libraries, content word walls, anchor charts,  and multiple opportunities and activities to practice language related  to a specific unit of study.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our ELL-SWD students are serviced within the classroom, when scheduling allows.  We mainstream students for clusters such  as Music, Art, Computer, and Physical Education.  ELL-SWDs also work in inclusive groups to meet their English proficiency with  ELLs who do not have IEPs.  Our schools instructional focus is to have multiple entry points and student engagement for all  students.  For both Literacy and Math we plan instruction to include multiple entry points and differentiation to meet the  needs of all of our learners, including those with IEPs.  RTI approaches are provided for ELL-SWDs also as needed. Our  classroom teachers, ENL teacher and service providers collaborate and review the IEPS of ELL-SWDs to determine which  curricular and instructional programs, units of study, themes and specific individual goals need to be addressed for each  child.  We meet throughout the year to determine next steps and ensure that all service providers are best supporting the  work and goals of the classroom teacher and the IEP to increase their growth in all academic areas.  Instruction is tailored for  individual needs on an ongoing basis and materials being used are evaluated for effectiveness.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  P.S.159 offers Tier I, Tier II, and Tier III ELA and Math  interventions for all students including ELLS and SWDs.   The language of  instruction is English except for when students use Imagine Learning which offers native language support (Mandarin,  Cantonese, Korean, Spanish, & Arabic are currently being utilized for our ENL Students),  .  For our Early Childhood students  double dose Fundations is offered.  Target groups are created for all ELL subgroups depending on the specific need in  ELA,  Math, Social Studies, and Science.  Ongoing data is collected to determine which students need additional support and  our RTI providers work with students to target the individual needs within each group.  We use a range of targeted  intervention services within Reading, Writing, Math, Science and Social Studies, teachers plan for individual conferences, small  group instruction and Academic Intervention Services (AIS) is offered in Literacy.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the 2017-2018 school year we now have two AIS providers. Ms. Diminc this year will have the full time position of  providing AIS support and Mrs. Myers will also be adding additional AIS support to her program.  Based on the Teachers  College data, ELA State Exam results, NYSESLAT results, EDAT and IEP goals we will be offering AIS to those students in need of  additional supports.  We are also changing our focus during the ENL, Literacy, Math and Special Education Team Meetings to  take deeper look at data in order to plan for a focused inquiry study that aligns with our Instructional Focus for this school  year.  Teams will continue to meet but we have added an additional component where the Team Leaders, ENL Coordinator,  Literacy Coach,  and administration will also meet to determine the protocol to be used for meetings and analyzing student  work, as well as to collaborate to determine one focused inquiry for the building that will encompass the work for our SWDs,  ENLs, and literacy and math needs of our school.  By working together to  analyze school data to drive instruction all staff will  be involved in working towards increasing the growth in all academic areas for all learners.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.  Programs offered throughout the school day (chorus, student council,  band) and after school (Test Prep, Enrichment) are inclusive to all students including ELLS, SWDs and ELL-SWDs.  ELLs are  invited to programs through teacher dialogue, connecting with parents to ensure they are aware of the given programs and  where applicable; letters are sent home to invite ELLs to participate.  ELLs are represented in many of our programs such as  our school choir, art club, on student council as elected by their fellow classmates and during morning   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      announcements.  Translation services are provided by many of our staff members who are fluent in Chinese, Korean, Urdu,  Hindi, Punjabi, Greek, Spanish, and Italian.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We use picture dictionaries, thinking maps,  native language libraries, listening centers, Words Their Way and Wordly Wise  3000.  We use a variety or technology including Brain Pop, Pebble Go, video clips to support content area instruction, Imagine  Learning with native language support for individual students and Imagine Learning for small group and whole group  instruction.  We also utilize Language Power for grades 3-5 which includes opportunities for close reading and listening to texts  that are aligned with content standards.     The ENL students who are serviced with Mrs. Delmonte (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and FELLS) utilize the  Imagine Learning Program with her, the classroom teacher and at home.  The Language Power Program is utilized with Mrs.  Delmonte for grades 3-5.  This program supports students reading, writing, listening and speaking and also incorporates math,  social studies and science themes into the units throughout the school year.  The Words Their Way Program for English  Language Learners is used for grades K-2 in the stand alone ENL program.  Students from all grades in all ELL subgroups also  receive additional Fundations support during Mrs. Delmonte's program to support their classroom work and individual needs.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In our ENL program model, home language support is delivered by utilizing Imagine Learning, picture dictionaries and books in  the native language.  Students are given dictionaries for use in class and may borrow them to support at home.  Our school  does not have DL or TBE programs.  Many of our teachers, paraprofessionals, and support staff are bilingual and offer native  language support as needed.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    In grades K-5 teachers are dual licensed and provide the required services, in addition to the ENL support provided by Melissa  Delmonte.  Teachers work with their grade as a team, our Literacy Coach, Allison Myers and ELL Coordinator, Melissa  Delmonte to ensure that the resources correspond to ELLs ages and grade levels.  Our ELL providers provide materials as  needed to support all areas of instruction and supports any modifications needed to instruct our ELL population.  Our  collaborative professional community allows for staff to provide practices when differentiating for ELLS.    The resources used to support our ELLs are aligned to the units of study for their specific grade in reading, writing, math,  science and social studies.  The students are exposed to texts at their independent and instructional level that corresponds  with the vocabulary and themes being studied in the classroom. Reading A-Z offers texts on a variety of levels and teachers  also utilize other websites to find appropriate instructional tools to scaffold their lessons and allow for multiple entry points.  Pebble Go, Razz Kids, and Vocabulary A-Z are also offered as tools to support teachers and students in meeting the individual  needs of our ELLS while ensuring their grade level and age is considered when planning for instruction.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    We offer our new ELL families a parent orientation. During this orientation, the families meet other families of incoming  students. Translators are available to provide language assistance. Our goal is to make each and every one of our newcomers  feel welcome and comfortable in their new environment and therefore we set the children up with a biliingual buddy. We  share with the families information regarding the local library and Internet resources they can use to support their  children.  The same is offered to ELLs and non ELLs who enroll throughout the school year.  Parents will also be given access to  the GO MATH online component to support math instruction as well.   Our ELLs in grades 2-5 are invited to the Summer Title III  program, which includes our current ELLs and ELL-SWDS at all proficiency levels.  Our Parent Coordinator, Kim Johnson is  available for any further information regarding these programs along with our School Counselor, Mary Jane Blau.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56            17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our school has created a vertical ENL team to support our ELLs. This team meets monthly with the ELL coordinator and  Assistant Principal to share out best practices and investigate ways in which to support their students and the families of the  ELLs.  All teachers are also offered opportunities to go outside the building to Teachers College and any other professional  learning that administration or the pedagogue finds that they feel can support their professional development.  Administration  emails PD opportunities to staff as a whole and individually on an ongoing basis annually to support personal learning goals  and needs.  Teachers College mentors all teachers throughout the year in the building and includes best practices for  supporting ELLs within their unit of studies.  Non-pedagogic staff are given opportunities to have professional development  with our teachers and additional opportunities with administration, the ENL coordinator, Literacy Coach or other pedagogues.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Professional Development at PS159 is an ongoing part of our goal to grow as professionals and ensure we learn how to meet  the needs of all students.  Administration has created a Professional Development Team for the 2017-2018 school year to  meet with in order to determine professional developments for our building.  During these meetings the ENL teacher will  collaborate with administration and the other members of the team to plan for the 15% and 50% of total hours of PD.  We are  always including ELLs and SWDs in our professional learning as the strategies used with these populations are best practices  for all students.  Mr. DiDio had created an electronic tracking form for the 2017-2018 school year for all professional  developments for individuals and school wide.  Administration also keep agendas from all meetings.      All Teachers will will participate in many professional developments this school year including Thinking Maps, Teachers  College, Go Math, Imagine Learning and Common Core Learning Standard professional developments.  All information learned  at any professional development is turn-keyed between all of the ELL providers and administration, literacy coach, classroom  teachers,  paraprofessionals, guidance counselor, social worker, school psychologist, special education teachers,  occupational/physical therapists, speech therapists, secretaries and our parent coordinator .  Instruction is supported by our  involvement in Teachers College and  Thinking Maps.  Thinking Maps are being used in every content area to support  comprehension and processing.  Our Literacy Coach Allison Myers is supporting the staff with Thinking Maps.  During  professional work time, staff will receive training from Melissa Delmonte (ENL Coordinator) about the EDAT and other best  practices learned at District Level Professional Learning.  All teachers, including teachers of ELLs are encouraged to attend  outside Professional Developments offered throughout NYC from the Office of ELLs and turn key any information learned  during weekly grade meetings.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57            The professional development requirements as per the CR Part 154 will be met through ongoing training throughout the  school year from a variety of professional developments.  Agendas and Attendance are kept by administration for all  meetings.  Professional developments will take place during grade meetings, on Monday during Professional Development  time from 2:20-3:40 and on Tuesdays from 3:00 to 3:35 during Professional work and during professional development time on  non-attendance days for students.  We will work on planning Reading and Writing Teacher's College Units of Study and Go  Math Units of Study to support our ELL population.  We will also receive trainings from our administration and literacy coach  outlining citywide expectations and what that looks like for all students including ELLs and ELL-SWDs. As a project school, we  will also receive training from Teachers College staff developers to meet the diverse needs of our ELL population.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   This year P.S.159 had an ENL Workshop for all parents of ELLs and FELLs.  The ENL Coordinator Melissa Delmonte met with  parents to review NYSESLAT and NYSITELL scores for their child.  We discussed the progress or lack of progress, and offered ESL  Strategies  to support their students language development.  Translation services are offered by our bilingual staff members in  Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Urdu, Punjabi, Hindi, Italian and Greek.   Throughout the school year, Melissa Delmonte and ENL  classroom teachers will continue to support ELL parents and set up individual and group meetings as  needed.  Furthermore,  individual meetings will be scheduled in addition to parent-teacher conferences and initial parent  orientations, to discuss goals of the program, language development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and  language development needs in all content areas in English.  Such meetings will be conducted with a qualified  translator/interpreter in the language or mode of communication the parent or guardian best understands.  Attendance will be  recorded, maintained and filed in the ELL office.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parent and Community involvement is stressed at P.S. 159. We reach out to parents with the help of our Parent Coordinator.  Every effort is made to provide materials in their native language. We also provide translators at Parent-Teacher conferences  and at parent-orientation meetings and workshops. Notices are sent home in all languages available and efforts are made to  acquire translation and interpretation for lower incidence languages.  Staff members also assist with translation in writing  when necessary. There are bilingual dictionaries offered and available for use during the school year.        Parents are welcomed and encouraged to participate in classroom activities in order to be familiar with all aspects of  instruction.  Parents are invited and encouraged to join in classroom activities, celebrations and school trips.   We know that  parents and families are an integral part to each students learning and that families can offer support not only during the  school day but at home as well.  The Parent Coordinator Kim Johnson offers parent workshops to facilitate communication and  support the needs of our parents and teachers; and the goals we expect our students to meet by the end of the school  year.  Translation is always provided in all of our parent involved activities with our bilingual staff members or outside services  if needed.  P.S.159 also hosts "Can We Talk?" with the principal, assistant principal and parent coordinator each month to  discuss any questions or concerns parents have.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    Our school provides a special after school program in order to support our ELL students. This after school program helps the ELL  students to gain a further understanding of the English language in a small group environment.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58                         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Paul DiDio, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS159                                                                              School DBN: 26Q159  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      At P.S. 159 we begin the collection of the written and oral translation needs of our families upon initial admission  to our school. We offer translated HLIS documents, utilize bilingual staff members for translation support and the  phone translation services to ensure parents understand the importance of the HLIS form that they are  completing. Once the HLIS has been completed with a pedagogue (Jasmeen Kim, ESL Teacher) a record is kept by  the ENL teacher of both the oral and written language that is requested and a copy is given to the classroom  teacher. This data is used to ensure NYS and NYC-DOE notices, brochures and information available in the native  language are provided to parents. Translation services are also provided for PTC. Report cards are printed in  English and all other languages as provided by DOE. Teachers can ask for assistance from bilingual staff members  to orally communicate with parents throughout the year. Parents are also welcome to provide their own  translators for meetings with staff. The Parent Coordinator is available to assist with obtaining translation  services. Community notices and school event notices requiring a response are stamped “Important Information - Please translate” in the major languages found at PS159 to ensure families are aware of all important dates and  school updates.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         2.

Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      A. PS 159 provides each parent whose primary language is available by the NYCDOE, with notices in their primary  language. In addition, each parent has access to copies of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities. Upon request,  we provide translation service with bilingual staff members. For Parent Teacher Conferences, PS 159 hires official  translator's in both Chinese and Korean to assist. We also utilize our school aides and paraprofessionals to assist with  translation.   B. In the entrance of the school there is the large WELCOME sign provided by the NYCDOE that informs families in all  languages that we offer translation services. The school security agent also has small cards that are given to parents to  bring to the office, to indicate which language they need translation and interpretation services. The Parent  Coordinator keeps a binder that is dedicated to parent information in all translated forms. Included in the binder is  the Translation and Interpretation Folder, the Bill of Parent Rights, as well, as a sign indicating that interpretation  services are available.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      C.

PS 159 does not have a parent population of more than 10% whose primary language is neither English or a  covered language.  E. The Department’s website shall provide information in each of the covered languages concerning the rights of  parents to translation and interpretation services and how to access such services. Our staff strives to ensure parents  are aware of all of their rights and have access and knowledge of how to access such websites that support translation  services.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Informal parent survey will be used to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services. In  addition, we will strive to schedule a focus group of parents inclusive of all cultures and languages represented at P.S.  159, to gather feedback and best practices on the quality and availability of services.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66
