This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The MISSION of P373R is to ensure that all of our children are able to participate and enjoy the school experience,  be included in their community and have the same opportunities as their peers.   The School Leadership Team discussed, developed and introduced three shared school vision statements on which  the school community (including students, parents and staff) voted. All stakeholders voted through a secure on-line  website. The winning vision statement was voted upon in May, 2016 and is, "Imagine with all your mind, Believe   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      with all your heart, Achieve with all your might!" In addition, the PTA website is up-to-date with school /  community events and ongoing updates.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Our school is a remarkable and special place! The Staff and Parent collaboration value the individuality, personality  and strengths of the students who attend, while going above and beyond to provide support for the individual  educational needs. Our goal is to meet our student’s potential by providing a rigorous and engaging environment  that prepares them for a successful path towards their future.   For many years, P373R has worked in a collaborative partnership with the Teddy Atlas Foundation in order to offer  incentives and special programs for students who achieve specific criteria in social, behavioral or academic goals.  We continue to build upon this program. In addition, we have formed a partnership with the North Shore Rotary  Club, who works with us to strengthen our dance program. Last year we were able to form a relationship with On  Your Mark and created an after school program for students with autism. We also work with Wagner College  student-teachers. In addition, our school collaborates with many art organizations. With existing programs, new  initiatives and grant opportunities put into place, we have laid the foundation of a strong arts programming  throughout our organization.   In addition, this year, we have continued and built upon our partnership with Person Centered Care Services,  located in Staten Island, close to our main site. PCCS is a non-profit advocating for social change within  communities. They offer family training and incentives for our students.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   P373 is a District 75, special education, multi-sited organization that provides a structured environment that  integrates instruction and support services within the school and community to students who experience delays in  the acquisition and generalization of social, emotional and academic skills. Further, crisis intervention, guidance,  occupational therapy, physical therapy, attendance, psychological services, nursing and family outreach are all  parts of our school program for our students who demonstrate severe, long-standing and pervasive emotional  difficulties. Our special populations include students in 6:1:1, 8:1:1, 12:1:1 and 12:1:2 settings, grades pre-K-8, both  alternate and standardized assessment. This includes students on the autism spectrum, emotional disturbance,  intellectual disabilities, etc. Specific student needs include a school-wide behavior support program,  implementation of various visual supports to general curriculum in order to give students access and adaptation of  curriculum to focus on specific skills.   In order to meet these needs, we implement strategies consistent with Positive Behavior Interventions and  Supports (PBIS). PBIS allows for high levels of student engagement by providing incentives and celebrations for  student efforts and including students in the planning of special events. Collaborative Learning Communities (PBIS  team) came up with a behavior mantra, PAWS (Prepare, Achieve, Wisdom, Safety), chose a school mascot (The  Wolf) and voted on school colors (maroon and white) in order to strengthen the vision and provide clear  expectations to students, staff and families. Each of our sites has a variety of supports for meeting student  developmental needs. Although there is clear organizational coherence within our PBIS program, it will look  differently at each site, as the students at each site are diverse and have a variety and multitude of disabilities.       The following instructional practices implemented at P373R are aligned to our school community’s beliefs about  how students learn best: Students learn best with visual supports, consistency, collaboration between home and  school, parent training and collaboration/sharing of information with all faculty and related service providers. We  provide multiple entry points for each child in order to engage in common core aligned or connected curricula. We   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      engage all students through small grouping, implementation of Universal Design for Learning strategies (visual,  kinesthetic materials) and aligning or connecting practices with the common core shifts.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Based on the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, our school made the most significant progress in the area of  Effective Leadership, which was our focus from last year. In 2017, under Framework Element scores, we scored 2.68  and in 2018 we scored 3.08, with a total increase of .40. Based on the Survey Element scores, we made the most  significant progress under Supportive Environment, where we increased a total of .68 (4.13 in 2017 compared to  4.71 in 2018).   Our key areas of focus for this school year includes Strong Family-Community ties. In this area, we only increased  by .2, whereas the range of gains in all other areas was .07-.68. Additionally, in this area, we are -.61 compared to  the city average. Under Outreach to Parents, most of the responses were positive. For example, under outreach to  parents, the range was 80% - 98% with the majority in the 90s. The lowest score was 80% of families say that they  get the opportunity to visit their child's classroom, such as observing instruction or participating in an activity with  their child.   Under Parent Involvement in School, we had a 88% positive responses and are +2% compared to city average. The  range of responses was 70% to 97% positive. The lowest scoring area is 70% of families say that they have the  opportunity to volunteer their time to support their school.

Our highest scoring framework element, according to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide is under Rigorous  Instruction, where we scored 4.73 out of 5 this year and increased by .07 when comparing to last year. Under  survey element scores, we scored 3.96 which was .29 more than the previous year. Although Rigorous instruction  has been a strength for the past several years, we continue to increase in scores through the years.   Our priority need, and instructional focus, continues to include writing. This year we created a new writing  assessment based on the writing continuum. The following is a summary of the data:   ================================================================================================ =================   Based on the following writing assessment from the 2017-18 school year, students made the most progress under  Sentence Fluency. The least gains were made under Organization. Student strengths were under the areas of Ideas  and Presentation.

NA        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)                                 Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   0    0    0    0    0      1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 373, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 373 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Our core mission is to support student success with individualized programs developed  within the core curriculum based on formative and summative student data and to provide an  educational environment that will enable all students to recognize, understand, label, express,  and regulate their emotions in order to be successful in all academic programs. Our vision is  "Imagine with all your mind, Believe with all your heart, Achieve with all your might!"   There are currently 77 students who have been identified as English Language Learners (ELLs)  out of the 568 students in our current population at P373R. Our English Language Learners  speak the following languages: Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Bengali, Albanian, Urdu,  Yiddish, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Macedonian and Tamil.  In the 2017-2018 school year, 68 students participated in the NYSESLAT. They received the  following scores: 31 students scored at the Entering level, 22 students scored at the Emerging  level, 8 students scored at the Transitioning level, and 7 students scored in the Expanding level.  The overall 2018 NYSESLAT report indicates that the majority of our students scored either at  the Entering and Emerging levels. In reviewing the NYSESLAT data, our team found that the  students' strengths are in the listening/speaking modalities of the NYSESLAT across the board.   To further ensure the academic growth of our ELL community, this year, we will use our Title  III funding to assist in bridging language and communication gaps for ELLs. We will continue  our "Families Learning Together Through the Arts" Saturday program for ELL students and their  families.   "Families Learning Together Through the Arts" is a new program where families will learn  about several art forms. We will continue working with Marquis Studio. Marquis Studio is a  non-profit organization providing arts-in-education services to public schools. They strive to  develop a strong partnership between artist and teachers by providing art programs to  supplement traditional classroom teaching techniques. Each residency or workshop focuses on a  specific visual or performing arts discipline selected by school staff and administration. Marquis  Studio and the ENL teachers will be providing several methods of creating art such as; sculpting,  Origami, Islamic Art, and elements of the circus. They will also be discussing which part of the  world each genre of art originated from. In addition, the workshop will also focus on the fact that  art is a language form in itself and that drawings and paintings were one of the first means of  communication. Throughout each session students and parents will compare and contrast each  art discipline and write an opinion piece based on what they have learned.  As research reflects, most of our students do best when supported by their families in extra- curricular activities (Ortiz,2001). With this in mind, the team determined that a Saturday group  that engaged both parents and ELLs in varied activities would be a viable option for supporting  our ELLs and their families. We are planning to form two classes of students who require a  student to staff ratio of 12:1:1 (One class will contain grades 1,2,3 and the other group will   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   contain grades 4,5,6). As examined in the 2018 NYSESLAT scores, our ELL students need more  assistance in reading and writing; the two most challenging modalities for most English  Language Learners.  Our focus for this program is to explore and celebrate various art forms that have originated from  around the world. Such examples include the history of sculptures throughout Greece, Egypt,  China, and Italy, Origami from Japan, the Circus from London, and forms of Islamic Art . Food  will also be included for this program to display how people around the world utilized food  ingredients for the purposes of making art. Students can use grains and proteins such as dried  pasta and beans to create designs and sculptures. With this examination of our ELL population in  mind, the team carefully selected a target group of ELL students, which are believed to benefit  most from the Title III program. Two bilingual paraprofessionals will participate in the Title III  instructional program. Two certified ENL teachers will instruct the Title III program. The  program will be supervised by an Assistant Principal.    We are in the process of sending out an official Title III letter to parents of ELL students in their  native languages, explaining the program and encouraging them to take advantage of this  opportunity for their children and themselves. The planned program will build basic language  and communication skills, as families work side by side with students and instructors. We will  use communication devices and applications on Ipads to create basic letter writing. Take home  art projects will be accomplished through the use of arts and crafts, and multi-sensory activities.  The instructional institute will run for seven, four hour, 30 minute sessions on a series of seven  Saturdays: March 9th, and 23rd, April 6th and 13th, May 4th and 18th, and June 1st. Our  Saturday instructional institute entitled: "Families Learning Together Through the Arts" will  begin on March 9th . Program hours will run from 9:00am until 1:30pm. Student IEP goals will  be addressed during the implementation and delivery of instruction. Grouping and differentiation  will be implemented, as learners will be placed according to ability levels. Instruction will be  aligned with the Common Core State Standards and New Language Arts (NLA) progressions.  One to one instruction will also take place as necessary in designated areas of student support.  Staffing will remain in line with IEP mandates. Children will be grouped accordingly in 12:1:1  ratio.  Instruction will be provided in English by two ENL certified teachers, supported by two  bilingual paraprofessionals. One Assistant Principal will supervise and assist in facilitation of the  program. Instructional groups will have the opportunity to work with both teachers in order to  provide students with the opportunity to access all activities. There will be Title III staff  members and bilingual paraprofessionals representative of various cultures who will assist in  facilitation of language. Both bilingual paraprofessionals are fluent in Spanish and interpret  when necessary.  In past years, we have purchased a variety of programmable Alternate Augmentative  Communication (AAC) devices to increase expressive communication skills for Alternate  Assessment students throughout the school day. These devices are easy to program and have  become an integral part of classroom instruction for engaging all students in listening, speaking,  and writing. Additional AAC devices were displayed throughout the school environment  providing access to all students to increase independent communication skills. In addition, our  students are eligible to receive iPads as communication devices through a grant our school has in  place. This year, we plan to purchase one additional iPad with Title III funds to allow additional  students to use Proloquo2Go, a communication App for children who have difficulty with verbal  communication. Materials for the cultural art project include post-its, folders, pencils, liquid  glue, stamps, index cards,ink pads, paint, glitter, scissors, tissue paper and laminating sheets to  create projects that could be used for our future Title III programs. Additionally, food ingredients  for assembling art pieces will be purchased with Title III funds to guide our ELL students in  developing a deeper understanding of different art genres from around the world.

Parents will learn how to use  different art supplies to create works of art at home  as well as how to support the social and  physical needs of their children. Parent workshop will take place while the parents are  participating  in all of the instructional activities alongside with the students.    A Parent Survey was used to gather information at the end of the last year's Title III program  regarding availability and interest in Saturday programming. The survey calculated parents'  interests regarding Saturday instruction based on what they learned last year and want to learn  this year.  Additionally, upon the start of the Title III program, our program staff will engage parents, as  well as students, who attend the program to develop new language skills utilizing technology  during instruction to facilitate communication. Information will be provided to parents in both  their home language and English. There will also be interpretation provided on site by the  bilingual paraprofessionals during the Saturday program.   During Title III instructional sessions in which parents will participate, we will focus on  modelling strategies to improve listening, speaking, reading, and integrating technology in the  creation of communication boards and other activities based on family need.   Parents will be notified of the 2018-2019 Title III program by flyers given in their home  languages at:  PTA meetings, SLT meetings, Parent Coordinator Workshops (translation services and  interpreters provided) and Official Title III Letters will be mailed and sent in students' backpacks  in parents' home languages.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Students receive one on one and small group instruction that focuses on exploring various forms of texts. Students also receive  integrated services during ELA periods in which both ENL and classroom teacher provide multiple modes of learning using the  Common Core Learning Standards. Multiple modes of learning include, sharing understanding through small and whole group  discussions, visual representations, media, and writing through various modalities. In addition, teachers implement  UDL strategies and offer visuals and manipulatives to give access to all standards.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Summative and baseline assessments include NYSESLAT, Fountas & Pinnell, Ready Gen, First Author, Writing Revolution,  GoMath, and Common Core Math and ELA. However, we have many students who are far below grade level. Therefore these  students are alternately assessed using SANDI, FAST, SMILE and UNIQUE.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  When students are in need of intervention, classroom teachers provide the necessary UDL strategies as well as use  intervention programs such as Fundations, Wilson, and GoMath Intervention kit.  Depending on student need, UDL strategies  may include providing differentiated visual, auditory, and tactile representations to enhance student learning. In addition,  classroom teachers give students opportunities to demonstrate understanding through the use of visuals, communication  devices, and text-to-speech technology.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    An ELL goal checklist will be created based on the RTI framework and students' IEPs and shared with our LAP team. Checklists  are collaboratively created between classroom and ENL instructors. Instruction will be drawn from student data based on their  strengths, areas of improvement, and prior knowledge. The program will be monitored throughout the school year and  progress will be noted. Checklists will be completed during these benchmarks and adjustments made to measure progress  towards meeting a goal. Progress will be measured by the degree to which a goal is met. According to the ELL Policy and  Reference Guide, Response to Intervention (RTI) approaches should be applied to ELL students who enter with lower levels of  proficiency in the home language, or if anticipated progress is not noted after a reasonable time period. Therefore, in order to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         support ELLs, P.S. 373 uses multiple resources such as the Wilson program, Treasures, Fountas and Pinnell, and teacher made  informal assessments. In addition, teachers are involved in Inquiry Teams where they will apply RTI methods for ELLs in need  of intensive small group or one to one intervention.        5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The data patterns for the NYSESLAT reveal that most of our students are either in the Entering or Emerging level. Most  students scored highest in the Listening portion of the exam followed by Speaking (where applicable), Reading, and Writing.  The data patterns for the NYSITELL reveal that most of our students are in the Entering level, which examined proficiency in  Listening and Speaking.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   ELL teachers share the findings from NYSITELL and NYSESLAT with all pertinent staff (including classroom teachers) in order for  this data to inform instruction. This occurs through cohorts, inquiry teams, co-teaching planning sessions.  Progress monitoring  on student individual goals occurs three times during the year to determine growth, needs and next steps.  This is shared  during teacher team meetings and co-planning sessions.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   PS373R has a Freestanding ENL Program using the integrated and stand alone model for a total of 72 ELL students. The stand  alone model refers to grouping students in a separate location from their non ELL classmates. Stand alone instruction works  towards developing English language skills so that students can succeed in core content courses. According to the ELL  Reference Guide p. 34 Integrated ENL is instruction to build English language skills through content area instruction. It is  delivered by a dually certified teacher (ENL and a content area) or co- teaching by a certified ENL teacher and a certified  content area teacher (i.e., English language arts, math, science, or social studies). Both methods of integrated ENL instruction  include content area subject matter and English language development using ENL strategies. All ELLs and former ELLs up to 2  years after exiting ELL status must receive a minimum number of units of integrated ENL." Both ENL teachers work in  collaboration with the classroom teacher to provide ELL students with content area instruction along with the rest of the class.  All ELL students are grouped heterogeneously together by three consecutive grade levels and special education classification.  Grouping of ELL students varies on class size and student need.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Currently our school only features the ENL program.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Currently our school only features the ENL program.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.       In accordance with CR Part 154, students at all proficiency levels receive ENL services consisting of the maximum  number of minutes that can be provided based on current staffing constraints. All minutes are serviced by a certified  ENL teacher, through the integrated and stand-alone model. Collaboration with classroom teachers and related  service providers are done at the beginning of the school year and throughout the school year in order to ensure the  mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to the student's proficiency levels.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?     PS373R has a freestanding ENL program. Therefore, during CR Part 154 mandated integrated ENL minutes, the ENL instructor  integrates for ELA and writing workshop. The use of writing workshop is enriched by implementation of scaffolding techniques  to enhance students writing schema and other performance tasks. Some scaffolding techniques include, but not limited to,  modelling, bridging, and schema building. Differentiated instruction and grouping are provided during ELA and writing. ELL  students who score below grade level receive increased instruction in skill areas using ENL methodology that includes the  Language Experience Approach and the Balanced Literacy concept. All of our intervention programs are in English. ELL  students whose instructional mandate is bilingual are provided with alternate placement paraprofessionals providing native  language support as needed. These interventions may include Academic Intervention Services (AIS), Counseling, guidance  and/or other after school programs. During stand-alone sessions, instructional methodologies and strategies used with the ELL  students are Total Physical Response (TPR), Language Experience Approach (LEA), CALLA, and Cooperative Learning. Adapted  materials are developed to help ELL students have access to the content learned in the classroom.    To bridge the gap between home and school for ELL students, we will adopt the following practices in the classrooms: 1)  Creating an instructional climate that includes all students' languages, 2) Encourage students to bring their home languages  into the classroom, 3) Encourage ELLs from the same background to cooperate with each other to improve progress, 4) Expand  the school's cultural repertoire by exposing students to subtitled movies, expanding libraries of bilingual books, providing  materials in students languages through the Internet and 5) Teaching songs in different languages.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.     To ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native languages, bilingual guidance counselors and bilingual  school psychologists are redeployed for triennials and re evaluations. Informal assessments by the ENL teacher include the use  of alternate placement paraprofessionals.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?     a. In the event that a SIFE student enters our program, an ENL instructor and Parent Coordinator will invite them to a face to  face intake meeting. The parent will receive a Parent Handbook and all of the information on NYC family resources, with an  interpreter if needed, and translated in print. This will be followed by a team meeting discussing the student's physical and  educational needs, as well as school policy and procedures. We will follow the the student's IEP goals and if the student is  bilingual, we will have the alternate placement paraprofessional work with the student on making the content comprehensible  to the student. We will continue to assess the students and provide remediation from the following including AIS, the  Language Experience Approach, Writing Workshops, Balanced Literacy enriched with scaffolding techniques such as modeling,  bridging, contextualization and schema building. Students also will work towards increasing reading skills through infusing ENL  strategies into Literacy lessons in the classroom and in our Title III Saturday Program.    b. ENL instructors will provide newcomers instruction through the Language Experience Approach, Writing Workshop,  Balanced Literacy enriched with scaffolding techniques such as modeling, bridging, contextualization and schema building.  Students will also work towards increasing reading skills through infusing ENL strategies into Literacy lessons in the classroom  and in our Title III Saturday program.    c. Developing ELLs receive the following intervention services: increased instructional skill areas for students with below grade  level scores in NYSAA assessment. The instruction uses ENL methodologies and strategies such as the Language Experience  Approach, Writing Workshop, Balanced Literacy enriched with scaffolding techniques such as modeling, bridging,  contextualization and schema building. Students will also work towards increasing reading skills through infusing ENL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      strategies into Literacy lessons in the classroom and in our Title III Saturday program.    d. Long Term ELLs receive instruction that develop a strong foundation in academic language in English and content area  courses that focus simultaneously on content and literacy learning across content areas. Long term ELLs will be given various  opportunities to participate in advanced academic tasks and interactions so that they develop the skills they need to be vibrant  members of a school's learning community and be on a path to college and career readiness. Scaffolding techniques and ENL  strategies are implemented into literacy lessons in the classroom that will guide them to college and career readiness.    e. Former ELLs receive integrated ENL instruction in ELA and/or other content areas. Students will also work towards  enhancing their reading skills through infusing ENL strategies that can be applied throughout all content areas.  Students will  be encouraged to attend our Title III Saturday program. As per the ELL Policy and Reference Guide p.38, Former ELLs are  students who had been identified as English Language learners and subsequently exited from ELL status. For at least two years  following the school year in which a student is exited from ELL status, former ELLs receive at least one half of one unit of study  of English as a new language (90 minutes per week) and are eligible for certain specified testing accommodations.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Academic Language Development is part of our school plan for ELL-SWDs. We have inclusion programs to maximize time spent  with typically developing peers. For Bilingual students in alternate placement settings, all classes are instructed in English with  our alternate placement paraprofessionals assessing their students' level of literacy in their native languages and supporting  them academically in their native languages and in English. The classrooms all have Smart Boards, Ipads, and a library which  supports our special needs students in ENL instruction through literature in English and students' native languages. The ENL  teachers are fully certified and collaborate with classroom teachers and counselors by assisting them in the use of ENL  strategies and techniques, as well as help using the Teacher's Resource Center where there are books and materials available  in the students' native languages. Some interactive methodologies and strategies include, Total Physical Response, Language  Experience Approach, field trips, small group activities, role playing, games, Think/Pair/Share, etc. Materials that we use  include graphic organizers such as, t-charts, webs, maps, flow charts, and Venn diagrams. We also provide visuals such as  videos, captioning, labeling and modeling. To enhance our ELLs' auditory skills, we provide various forms of music, audio tapes,  and chants to help memorize difficult content.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   We are a District 75 school, therefore, all of our students have IEPs. Our Main location primarily follows the same Common  Core Standards based curriculum as the general education population. Our off sites have flexible programming with the same  standards based curriculum so that all of our ELL students interact with the general education population. In order to ensure  that all of our programming is used to maximize time spent, all teachers receive a common prep period to collaborate on  strategies and activities which may better enable ELL students to accomplish IEP goals and become more proficient in English  in the least restrictive environment. We have inclusion programs to maximize time spent with non disabled peers.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Included in targeted intervention for ELLs in ELA are the use of sight word cards, running records, and strategies such as  modeling and accessing prior knowledge through the use of visual and tactile materials, and the use of high interest reading  materials at the students' reading level on a one-to-one basis. Targeted interventions for ELLs in Math include the use of Plush  toy numbers and other TPR manipulatives appropriate for ELLs using the Go Math program. Alternate Placement  Paraprofessionals assist students with bilingual mandates under the leadership of the ENL teacher.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Data has shown that our students need improvement in extended writing and reading comprehension. Therefore, we will  begin a new writing program for our standardized students called The Writing Revolution. The Writing revolution teaches  students how to enhance their writing by using more sophisticated syntax in their own writing, using more complex terms and  sentence constructions, organizing ideas in sequence information, and practicing note taking and paraphrasing to help absorb  and retain information. This will allow instructors to identify comprehension gaps.   In addition,  we began a reading program called Ready Gen. Ready Gen facilitates students' learning of academic vocabulary,  close reading, and foundational skills, and further deepens content knowledge and comprehension. Ready Gen introduces  various genres and helps students understand key language, structures and ideas. Ready Gen also allows students to  practice three forms of writing: opinion, narrative and informative.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Not applicable.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   CHAMPS after school program is a middle school sports and fitness league that promotes physical activity among children  going through their critical years of middle school. This behavior based program is available for all students, including ELLs,  who need encouragement academically and socially. This program runs two times a week, from 3pm to 5pm in the fall, winter  and spring. Families receive a consent form in their preferred language. We also offer various Art programs. One Art program  is funded through the Cultural After School Adventures (CASA), which welcomes all students. It is an annual program that  allows students to express themselves through various forms of art. The 20 week Art program runs during school hours. In  addition, Sundog theatre and Urban Voices are programs that enhance students creativity through performing arts. These 20- 30 week programs are also held during school hours. This allows all students opportunity to participate in supplemental  activities. Families receive flyers and consent forms in their preferred language. We also offer a Title III Saturday program,  which welcomes all ELLs and their families. This program allows families to participate in student activities while learning  English. This seven session program runs from 9am to 2pm. Families receive informational flyers and permission slips in their  preferred language.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our classrooms have smart boards, Ipads, and smart tables. Smart boards are used interactively for students to collaborate in  small and whole groups. Interactive activities include, but not limited to, problem solving games for Mathematics, listening and  reading activities for ELA, Science and Social Studies. Some interactive games for the smart board are purchased from  Lakeshore Learning, which provide visuals and supplementary activities from their Science and Social Studies curriculum. The  Ipads include applications for Entering and Emerging ELLs that focus on phonics, grammar, and spelling. Other applications for  all of our proficiency levels include listening and comprehension activities. In addition, thinking maps and other various types  of graphic organizers are incorporated into all content area instruction. We also provide bilingual glossaries, dictionaries, and  literature for our ELLs.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  PS373R only has a freestanding ENL program. All of our programs are in English with alternate placement paraprofessionals  providing native language support as needed for Bilingual students.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   The required services support, and resources correspond to ELLs ages because the age range for placement is no longer than a  three year age span between students, which is appropriate to grade level. These service supports for special education ELLs  are discussed with parents during the Educational Planning Conference at the CSE level. PS373R has Parent Orientation   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      regarding the programs that we provide for our ELLs. In addition, content area programs are provided for all students for their  appropriate grade and age level. When needed, our school provides supplementary materials so that all ELLs have equal access  to the resources and programs. The school works collaboratively with parents, classroom teachers, and service providers to  ensure that each ELL student is receiving the appropriate resources and services for the ELL's age and grade level.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    PS373R has eight co-locations. Therefore, it is essential that our co-locations are in frequent communication. Our school  developed a folder in Google Drive, which allows all instructors to share resources, notes, rubrics, checklists, student data and  academic programs. Google Drive is a live program in which instructors can actively communicate and share comments and  suggestions, which will ensure that all ELLs needs are met throughout all co-locations.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Newly enrolled ELLs are encourage to attend our Chapter 683 program prior to the start of the school year. Before and during  the school year, families are encouraged to visit the school and receive a tour of the school with the parent coordinator. In  addition, we explain the Common Core Standards and how their child will work towards increasing their skills using Common  Core Standards and ENL methodologies infused into our curriculum.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   At this time we have no language electives.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Currently, our school only features the ENL program.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   All ELL personnel are given plentiful opportunities to attend professional developments throughout the  school year.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  In PS373R, non-ENL and non-bilingual teachers, related service providers, and administrators are offered the opportunity to  attend training which will suffice as Jose P. training as well as to fulfill CR Part 154 mandated professional development on ELL  topics by attending professional learning sessions offered by the District 75 Office of ELLs. Professional development  opportunities are also given during Election Day and Chancellor's Conference Day through UFT and District 75 headquarters.  Certificates are provided if taken at the District 75 department training.  ENL professional developments that are offered in  and out of our organization can be accessed on www.District75PD.org and DELLSS.  In addition, classroom teachers are given a  common prep period for opportunities to receive professional development.  50 minute webinars using WETEACHNYC.org and  Share My Lesson are available for all teachers throughout the year.  Each professional development will include an agenda,  sign in sheet, and a handout that highlights important information for teachers to refer to and implement into their  instructional practice when necessary. All professional development documents will be stored in the ELL Folder of Critical  Documents.     2.

Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As per the ELL Policy and Reference Guide p. 36, "Schools must individually meet with the parents or guardians of English  language learners at least once a year...". ENL instructors schedule appointments with ELL parents or guardians at their best  convenience during school hours. To accommodate our parents, meetings are conducted either in person or by phone. If  needed, meetings include a qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication the parent or guardian  best understands.  When meeting with the parents or guardians of the English language learners the ENL teacher discusses the  individual goals, needs, and program for that particular student. Parents are informed about the students strengths and any  additional needs in regards to the student's language development.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The role of our parent coordinator is to be a liaison between the parents and the school's principal. The parent coordinator  interacts with parents on a daily basis, in which she addresses questions and concerns that families may have in regards to  their children. In addition, the parent coordinator provides various resources that include, but not limited to, medical,  educational and after school programs.  Our Parent Coordinator has a meet and greet at the beginning of the school year. Interpretation services are provided to those  whose preferred language is other than English. We have a variety of school websites where parents can visit to learn about  activities that take place during the school year, view photographs of their children engaged in learning, and have access to a  variety of resources. Parents can access the website in other languages, if necessary. Monthly calendars and flyers are sent out  in English and in parents' native languages that inform parents about upcoming school and District 75 workshops and events.  Some events include, seasonal festivals, game nights and fund raisers. Some workshops include, Picture Exchange  Communication System Overview, Meet and Greets, and Medicaid waiver workshops. Phone blasts are included into our  parent outreach which address important information regarding the school and students. Phone blasts can be provided in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67            parent's preferred language as well.
