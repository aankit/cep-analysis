This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview         PHILOSOPHY     We believe a solid education includes a strong intellectual foundation across all disciplines, including the arts,   rich literature, meaningful trips, and hands-on exploration with diverse and relevant materials.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9           We believe the role of the school is to educate children to be aware of the world around them and be   thoughtful, caring, kind, and tolerant members of their communities.      We believe children are curious by nature and learn along their own unique paths and time line.    We believe children express their understanding in different ways.     We believe children’s learning is holistic and integrated across all subjects.    We believe children and teachers think deeply about their work and its relevance in the world.    We believe children learn best in a trusting and safe environment, one in which they are supported to follow   their interests and approaches to learning.     We believe children learn from making and doing with a range of materials and media, in collaboration with   peers and through the support of adults.   2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The Ella Baker School is a Pre-K to 8 th grade public school located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in the Julia  Richman Education Complex. We are a non-catchments area school and accept students from all five boroughs,  whose families work in the area. We serve a population of approximately 340 students from culturally, racially and  socio-economically diverse backgrounds.   The Ella Baker School is committed to a child-centered, experienced-based curriculum, where children devote time to  the exploration of ideas by using materials and developing extensive projects. Our community values the importance  of making choices, working collaboratively and planning curriculum that meet the interests, needs, and learning styles  of all children. Our experienced and devoted teachers work with each child for two years in multi-age classrooms,  providing continuity of experience and enabling collaboration for children of different ages.   The Ella Baker community is committed to building the confidence of each student and discovering each child’s  strengths and unique voice. We do this by enhancing our curriculum with the interests and needs of our children in  mind. We help them to connect and explore their ideas in a deeper, more meaningful way, while immersed in inquiry  and problem solving. During “Work Time”, children have the opportunity to make choices about their work and reflect  on materials and the methods to using them. They collaborate with others and become strong communicators and  creative thinkers. Children educated in this way become aware of the world around them and are thoughtful, caring,  kind and tolerant members of their communities.       Teachers take advantage of the many opportunities for learning in New York City. Our children attend many cultural  events. Our school continues to strengthen our collaboration with science institutions to further enhance our  offerings in scientific inquiry and research. We work with the Christodora Science Education Program, Museum of  Natural History, Rockefeller University and others that support our work. We are focus on creating rich  interdisciplinary core curriculum in science and humanities within trimesters throughout the year. We continue to  seek support from new organizational structures within the Department of Education: District 2's Math Leadership  Institute and The Manhattan Field Support Center's funding of the Math Collective and Balanced Literacy team.      Created in 1996 by former teachers and administrators from Central Park East Elementary School, The Ella Baker  School was founded on the principles of progressive education: inquiry, project based learning using a variety of  materials; developing children's ideas through choice; collaboration in the classroom and with staff; partnering with  parents, CBO's and cultural institutions throughout NYC; commitment to diversity in our community and respecting  varied historical and cultural perspectives; engagement in democratic governance and inclusive practices. The school  is named after Ella Josephine Baker (December 13, 1903 – December 13, 1986), an unsung hero of the civil rights  Freedom Movement who inspired and guided emerging leaders. Ella Baker’s influence was reflected in the nickname  she acquired: "Fundi," a Swahili word meaning a person who teaches a craft to the next generation. We aspire to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      teach and lead by her principles – to help students unlock the power within themselves to go out into the world with  confidence and with a love of learning.   The Ella Baker School celebrates a diverse student population with a wide range of learning styles, strengths and  challenges. Our inquiry, project based, curriculum incorporates a variety of materials, literature and experiences  supporting children's understanding of big ideas while developing the academic skills embedded in the study. All  curriculum is aligned to the NYS Common Core Standards. Teachers are able to work with individual children and  small groups targeting instruction that meets the needs of all children in the classroom. Groups are flexible according  to the needs of the children. Our teachers understand that children learn best by having clear expectations for their  work and by having many experiences where they are able apply and practice skills and concepts. Teachers provide  ongoing feedback, scaffold and differentiate instruction using a multi-sensory approach to teaching and learning  facilitating optimal learning conditions.      Our families and PTA work closely with staff and administration to support school wide initiatives as well as advocate  for additional areas of focus and growth. With the support and collaboration of the PTA our school is now able to  offer Spanish language and culture instruction to children in grades Pre- K through 8. We have also been able to offer  additional school trips and support a school wide interdisciplinary focus on science. We have facilitated workshops  that are of interest to parents especially in the teaching of math and reading. Our families come from all five boroughs  and work in the area therefore we offer many opportunities for families to connect with each other fostering a  deeper sense of commitment and engagement with our community. We continue to celebrate school wide traditions  engaging everyone in our community, some events are: Town Meeting, The Annual Potluck Dinner, Field Day, monthly  weekend play dates in all boroughs, The Ella Baker Commemoration, Talent Show, Art Auction, and a Family Review of  their children's "Collection of Work".          3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We will have three (3) Integrated Cooperative Teaching classes, (ICT) in 2018-2019. Special Education services  including Occupational, Physical and Speech Therapy are provided on site. Teachers work with all children to develop  their ideas and skills by designing compelling and relevant curriculum with multiple entry points for all learners. Our  experienced teachers target children in need of Academic Intervention and develop plans that support continued  growth and may lead to formal services if needed. We have a wide range of learners in each heterogeneous  classroom. Special Education staff meet weekly to discuss and develop teaching strategies to support children's  learning and teacher's differentiation of curriculum.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The Framework for Great Schools offers educators a clear path towards developing a strong teaching and learning  community through a Supportive Environment. It highlights the interrelationship between significant indicators that  have a deep impact on student achievement. Through Effective School Leadership the Ella Baker School is a strong  learning community that cares deeply about the growth and development of everyone in the school including  children, families and staff. All staff members collaboratively engage in weekly staff meetings where ideas are  exchanged and decisions are made. Teachers and paraprofessionals make professional decisions about curriculum  studies and have agency over their work. Teachers review student work and are able to make informed decisions  about amending work to support the needs of their students.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     After carefully reviewing student work, student collections and portfolios, as well as discussing the NYS tests in ELA  and in Mathematics, our school determined that we needed focused and sustained professional development in these  two overarching areas: mathematics and a review of the elements of a strong balanced literacy approach which  includes reading, writing, speaking and understanding. There are eight new staff members, (teachers with three or  less years of experience). We decided to build teacher capacity and teacher leadership to plan responsive professional  development in these core subjects.   The Ella Baker School is committed to developing student’s mathematical thinking and skills. We strive to develop  mathematicians and classrooms that are rich in inquiry using a constructivist approach to math. Our teachers work to  develop meaningful problems where students are required to show their thinking. Implicit to this work is context,  representation and discourse. We are also cognizant that children also need explicit, small group instruction to learn  skills. We therefore balance our classroom with problem solving and skill building.   We will continue to work with a professional developer from Math in the City as well as partner with other schools to  study best practices in math teaching. We will also update math curriculum in K-5 with TERC curriculum to further  support instruction with a cohesive approach to constructing mathematical thinking in teachers and children.    We will continue to adjust grade appropriate assessments aligned to the Mathematical Common Core Learning  Standards.    We were celebrated for the strengths in our community by the findings in the 2017-2018 Quality Review.   Findings:   "Teacher pedagogy promotes the ideas of multiple entry points and student engagement. Every classroom  demonstrated meaningful ways in which all students could access complex ideas or concepts and engage in high- level questioning and student-to-student discussion."   Impact   "Teaching strategies are aligned to the instructional shifts and promote college and career readiness skills. Learners  are actively engaged in multiple learning opportunities that incorporate higher order thinking skills and high-level  discussions.

We have begun working with outside organizations, such as the Tri-Institute Research Outreach program through the  Rockefeller University, Weill Cornell, and Memorial Sloan Kettering. Additionally, we have strengthened our existing  partnerships with Christodora and Math for America. We continue to develop our relationships with the American  Museum of Natural History, the Rockefeller Foundation, high schools science programs within the Julia Richman  Education Complex, (JREC) and with hospitals and scientists in our community.   The work of our science committee, comprised of teachers, parents and scientists, have been meeting to determine  our needs and extend science possibilities within our school and classrooms.

Throughout the 2018-2019 school year, all classroom teachers will develop student math proficiency. Three times a year  students will go through a series of interim assessments. Assessment cycles will be completed in October, February and  June using the Primary Learning Record. By June 2019 all students will achieve to at least 85% accuracy on grade level on  the fluency portion and develop and word problem strategies throughout the course of the year. Our school has been  granted the ability to develop and use our own assessments under the provisions of PROSE. To do this we have garnered  the support of City College and Math in the City to support and refine the research based assessments and follow-up.  Following these assessments, classroom teachers work collaboratively to describe and evaluate student work in order to  develop targeted instruction for the class, small groups and individuals. The assessments and subsequent cycle of work  is reviewed to understand children's thinking, understanding and growth. Teachers plan activities and lessons  accordingly. The careful review of each child's growth and understanding is recorded in three narrative reports  throughout the academic year. Children share their work during family conferences twice yearly.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15      Students will be instructed to use efficient and effective strategies as outlined by the Common Core Learning Standards  as well as have opportunities to articulate both orally and in writing arguments that justify their work and critique the  work of their peers.

We will continue to focus on a cycle of weekly professional development, recommitting ourselves to the  understanding and breadth of literacy, looking critically for ways to enhance opportunities for meaningful writing,  reading, dialogue and communication in all curriculum areas. There are quite a few new staff members and it is  important to engage all staff in discussions around our school wide understanding of literacy instruction and the  Habits of Mind. This forms the foundation for inquiry across content areas paying attention as well to democratic  principles of inclusion and multi-cultural perspectives. We will also focus on creating dynamic interdisciplinary core  curriculum in science and humanities as well as continue to develop mathematics instruction.   The Quality Review celebrated our school wide assessment practices as evidence by a rating of Well Developed.  However, this area was also identified as an area of continued focus. The findings and impact stated in the QR are the  following:   "School leaders and staff align assessments to curricula, use on-going assessments and grading practices to analyze  data on student learning outcomes, and make instructional adjustments at the team and classroom levels. Teachers  use on-going checks for understanding to inform them of next instructional practices."   "The school's use of common assessments, data analysis, descriptive reviews of individual students , and feedback ,  allow teachers to make thoughtful instructional adjustments at the classroom and school level that meet students'  learning needs."   Embedded in our work with PROSE is the understanding that we will continue to develop and strengthen our  assessment practices. After carefully reviewing our informal and formal assessments and The Primary Learning Record  (PLR), it was determined that we need to coach and instruct all teachers on how to use the PLR for collecting  information, reflecting on information and developing next steps for individual students, small groups and whole class  instruction.   Our internal data determined that teachers needed support on analyzing trends in the classroom and developing  targeted instruction that meets the needs of all students. We will work with teachers to share strategies and monitor  student progress throughout the year, and ensure assessments are aligned to curriculum so we are better able to  modify curriculum as needed. This process actively engages our staff in looking at student work. This practice allows  teachers to refine their ideas and thinking, further developing small learning groups to address particular needs/skills  in the classroom.   Our collaboration with other PROSE schools supports this work. By using Descriptive Review Practices developed at  the Prospect School, our teachers will continue to develop their skills in observing and noting children's modes of  thinking, learning and interests. This provides insight on how to facilitate new learning opportunities.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

By June 2019 students overall perceptions of their teachers and work will increase overall by 50% based n the  information provided by the 2018-2019 School Quality Guide.      By June 2019 the school will obtain an overall score in School Element Score of of a 3.25 under Supportive Environment..   The Ella Baker School will use school-wide assessment practices throughout the 2018-2019 school year and use this data  to develop plans that outline next steps and strategies for each child.      Our goal is to support each student by systemically collecting and analyzing student work using the Primary Learning  Record (PLR). This will ensure that each student is able to meet personal goals and work towards or exceed the goals  set forth by the NYS Common Core Learning Standards. We will use this tool within each curriculum area for work  during cohort meetings and weekly professional development.      To do this, we will analyze our system-wide use of the assessments to ensure that they are aligned to curriculum, the  demands of the Common Core Learning Standards and Capacity Framework. Our work will guarantee that we are  meeting children where they are and developing strategies to facilitate learning along the continuum across subject  areas. We believe that we must understand how children learn, paying close attention to their interests, strengths  and challenges. By knowing students and their learning preferences well, we can individualize instruction to address  needs using these areas of high interest.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          24     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

All teachers will use the Primary Learning Record (PLR) to record,  make observations, reflect on lessons and student work and  provide strategies for next steps. The school will complete this  process three times a year for each student. This process is  cyclical. Teachers will adjust book levels, develop projects that  motivate students, provide more or less supports for writing  assignments, and identify math models for students based on  individual next steps.   In each unit throughout the year, students will complete a task  which asks them to think deeply and make connections in their  work. Each task will be developed by the cohort and will embody  the skills, strategies and the big ideas inherent to the inquiry at  hand. This task will be used as a measure to demonstrate the  children’s understanding of the content areas being studied.  Work will be aligned throughout the course to allow children to  show their thinking. The end of unit task/project will allow  children to develop thoughtful, comprehensive projects that  delve more deeply into the subject matter while showing  children’s creativity, voice and choice within the framework of  study.

A belief at the Ella Baker School is that students are able to do great work. We believe that Project Based Learning is  the most effective way to motivate students and teachers to do work that is both interesting and important. We know  that this work is rigorous and meaningful. Project Based Learning is at the core of great thinking and utilizes all of the  Habits of Mind to ensure a comprehensive view of a study. These projects also involve families and our community in  real and meaningful ways. Our families/community members become stakeholders in this process and are present  throughout our unit studies: they visit classrooms to be interviewed; they participate in helping craft projects and give  advice on structure or revision; they assist in critiquing work; and most importantly, they come to celebrate the great  work of the students.    As a school we have identified that, although we were all participating in Project Based Learning, some teachers were  not familiar with the multitude of processes, elements and nuances that establish great projects where access, norms,  investigation and revision are paramount. This was evidenced by projects both complete and incomplete during the  2016-2017 school year.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  Teachers and administration have identified Project Based Learning as an initiative for the upcoming calendar year.    During the last trimester of the 2018-19 school year and over the summer of 2019 teachers teachers teams will develop  and projects that follow the criteria established by Learning Futures. Our professional development team began the  work with a writing unit. With the addition of a curriculum developer, we will continue the work over the summer of  2019. It has been is an on-going initiative throughout this current school year and will continue next year, Our goals is to  support teachers in organizing and implementing various projects across the grades.   With the help of the staff we have identified three dates throughout the 2018-2019 school year where cohorts and  classes will showcase their work. Additionally, we have identified dates where cohorts and teachers will be able to fine  tune their projects to ensure a comprehensive, rich end-products. Working in teams and using the same system for  refining each unit, we will reinforce the concepts and components that ensure student work to be as thoughtful,  rigorous and relevant as possible.   These projects force us to go beyond the classroom and reinforce the work we are already doing with outside  organizations, as well as develop new relationships with others.

Working with families is essential to how community is developed at Ella Baker. The School Quality Review (QR) rated  us as well-developed in 3.4. The QR findings describe this "holistic approach to students and commitment to  perpetuating a democratic community results in a high degree of efficacy among students and staff. The staff is  committed to... high expectations for all students." These expectations are based on a deep knowledge of individual  students. Knowing each student's family and embracing them as partners in their children's education is one key to  forging these expectations. This relationship begins even before children begin their first day of school through  parent-staff communication.      As a result of our high expectations of students and parent involvement, the QR found that the Ella Baker School is a  "highly supportive learning environment, where school leaders communicate high expectations for professional  learning and parent involvement leading to a path for college and career readiness for all students."       The data that supports these findings are the teachers plan for individual students, the guidance counselor's  relationship with students and families, the on-going relationships developed by service providers such as  Speech/Language Specialists, Occupational Therapists, Physical Therapists and Special Education teachers, and the  ways in which the staff communicates with families.      This year, in order to strengthen the crucial relationship between families and the school community, The Ella Baker  School will continue to build upon the legacy of Ella J. Baker and our commitment to social justice and human rights.  Staff, students and families will reflect on these issues throughout the curriculum. We will continue to honor Ella  Baker and other great civil right leaders in this country and throughout the world that have made lasting and  transformational contributions to the world. We will continue to host events organized by staff and parents to  showcase our students accomplishments through a variety of different modalities and in a way that pays tribute to  her legacy: past, present and future. One goal is that families will have opportunities to connect with this legacy and  feel stronger ties to the mission of the school.

Over the 2018-2019 school year, school staff and a parent committee will reflect after each event, looking at the  students involved, how they presented their materials, levels of parent attendance and involvement and what was  ultimately the takeaway of the event. In May, this group will gather for a last meeting to discuss the findings of the year  and look to build our event calendar for the 2019-2020 based on what went well and what needs continues to need  development. Working together in this capacity will ensure that staff and parents are connected in belief and mission.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Ella Baker School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      The Ella Baker School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ●providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ●providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ●fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ●providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ●sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      ●providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ●actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ●support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ●maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ●conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ●provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   ●host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ●schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or  evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ●translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ●conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ●holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ●hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ●encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ●supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ●establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ●encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ●providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their children’s  progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ●providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Assessments tools used at Ella Baker include, but are not limited to, the Teacher's College Reading Assessments with running  records, the Fundations Early Intervention reading and writing assessments, the Primary Learning Records (PLRs) and student  portfolios. These tools provide a look at student growth over time. The data shows that our students' academic needs are a  result of their emergent literacy skills as opposed to their language development. Due to this insight, we are continuing to  provide targeted instruction based on student need.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The Ella Baker School has a few tiers to look at  data to make recommendations for programming and instruction.  The  ESL teacher, Assistant Principal and Special Education Coordinator review data and develop plan to meet instructional   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         needs.  The ESL teacher then meets with the student's classroom teacher to share report and remediation.  The classroom  teacher then provides feedback and clarification for their own classroom practices. These groups meet prior to each marking  period to discuss growth and further remediation.          3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of our program is measured through the analysis of a wide range of data sources, including but not limited to:   - student collections   - Primary Learning Records   - Running Records  - Internal math assessments   - student reflections   - teacher narratives  - student articulation     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Again the committee ( ESL teacher, Special Education Coordinator and the Assistant Principal) plus the classroom teacher  follow a protocol to discuss further planning for each student receiving ELL support.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   RTI is a focused problem-solving model. Students are provided with increasingly intensive, targeted instruction designed to  match their learning needs, as demonstrated by performance on periodically administered assessments. This problem-solving  model holds particular promise for ELLs, a group for which there are significant concerns about appropriate placement in  special education services; evidence suggests that in many cases, ELLs identified with learning disabilities (LD) are experiencing  difficulties that may not, in fact, stem from LD. When fully and effectively implemented, the RtI model is designed to:      •     determine whether students are benefiting from an instructional program within a reasonable time      •     build more effective instructional programs for students who are not benefiting      •     compare the efficacy of different forms of instruction      •     design more effective, individualized instructional programs      •     reduce inappropriate referral rate      •     increase educational opportunities for linguistically and culturally diverse populations   All of these actions have great potential for effective prevention and intervention efforts to support academically at-risk  ELLs.  This information helps initiate important conversations about classroom- and school- level models of prevention that  meet the needs of diverse populations of learners, including ELLs at-risk for academic difficulties.  Student data continues to  drive instruction which targets the needs of our students.  This model is used as a framework to ensure that the most effective  instructional techniques are being used to help support each child as the progress.          6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Our students are growing in their language development, especially listening and speaking. However, they are not at the point  expected by the NYSESLAT in terms of writing and listening.  5 out of the 7 students that took the  NYSESLAT made growth in  their assessments, 2 students made the jump to advanced intermediate to advanced.  The data indicates that most of our  efforts will be placed on narrative writing.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Our staff reviews students work and assessments to support skill and language development. Teachers develop individual  plans that differentiate instruction and provides strategies for optimal learning. Using a multi-sensory approach to teaching  and learning is also instrumental to student success.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   As per the new CR Part 154 requirements, beginning September 2015, students will be carefully programmed to  receive the mandated ENL and ELA instructional minutes based on new proficiency guidelines.  Beginners/Entering  students will receive a minimum of 540 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 180 minutes of ENL standalone, 180  minutes of integrated ENL/ELA and 180 minutes of standalone or intergrated ENL with ELA or any other content  area).  Low Intermediates/Emerging will receive 360 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 90 minutes of  standalone ENL, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA  and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any  other content area.)  Intermediate/Transitioning willl receive 180 ENL minutes per week (this consists of 90 minutes  of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other  content area). Advanced/Expanding will receive 180 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 180 minutes of  integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.)  Proficient/Commanding or students who are former ELL's will receive 90  minutes of ENL each week (this consists of 90 integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.)   We have a series of delivery models to ensure that each student receives these mandated ESL and ELA minutes. The  school schedule and teacher programming ensure that all entitled ESL students receive the mandated number of  minutes required according to CR Part 154.  In addition to our regular content curriculum all ELL students are given  extra ESL instruction in order to meet the number of minutes they require of ESL instruction each week.  Instruction is delivered through a combined pull-in and push-in model for all English language students. The ELL  teacher collaborates with the classroom teacher and related service providers to establish goals and discuss present  levels of performance of each student. All educators working with the student helps to determine necessary  classroom supports to scaffold learning and any modified or reference that is needed. b. Students are grouped  according to academic need, behavioral needs, interests, and preferences. It is our belief at Ella Baker that this mixed  heterogeneous-homogeneous grouping approach leads to greater student engaged as student choices are  represented, including through grouping.:        b.

Intermediate/Transitioning willl receive 180  ENL minutes per week (this consists of 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area and 90 minutes of standalone   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area). Advanced/Expanding will receive 180 minutes of ENL per week (this  consists of 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.)  Proficient/Commanding or students who are former  ELL's will receive 90 minutes of ENL each week (this consists of 90 integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.)   We have a series of delivery models to ensure that each student receives these mandated ESL and ELA minutes through  discrete ESL classes. The school schedule and teacher programming ensure that all entitled ESL students receive the mandated  number of minutes required according to CR Part 154.  In addition to our regular content curriculum all ELL students are given  extra ESL instruction in order to meet the number of minutes they require of ESL instruction each week.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      The Ella Baker School is a school that utilizes the Common Core Standards to guide the instruction of all students, thus does  not prescribe to methodology. However, the school does assess the needs of all students and uses methods that are  differentiated to meet those needs.       Delivery of content material:   Ella Baker teachers as well as all of our content area teachers provide content area support for ELL's through all content area  classes. All students take math, science, social studies, and ESL and/or English every year.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Every step possible is taken in order for students to be evaluated in their home language, when necessary. In the past we  have utilized out of classroom teachers, DOE teachers from neighboring schools, and outside translation services.  However,  based on our school data for the past 10 years, no student in K-8 has needed to be evaluted in their home language in content  subjects.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. We advise the parents who choose to enroll at Ella Baker of the options for ELL learners offered by the Board of Ed. and at  Ella Baker specifically. b. Provide more periods of ESL group sessions to increase the exposure to the language. Provide the  required number of ESL periods along with qualified support during the remainder of the instruction time (ESL pull out and the  certified Bilingual teacher providing monolingual instruction). c. Provide more individualized ESL instruction to address  particular language deficiencies based on teacher observations and formal and informal assessments. Teachers present  student as a case study to the collective group. The team then discusses the student's work, assignments, and assessements to  determine follow-up interventions. d. Please see letter c. e. Student work is presented at monthly conferences with the LAP  team to review their work and ensure growth moving forward, and to determine/confirm that additional English language  support is no longer needed.   b. Instructional plan for SIFE Students:  All students who are identified as SIFE students (Students with Interrupted/Inconsistant Formal Education) are immediately  flagged and provided additional support in English literacy until a level of proficiency is achieved as determined by the SIFE  coordinator and the SIFE leadership team along with the student’s individual teachers and guidance counselors.  The common  denominator among these students is a weakness or inability to read or write in their native language.   Once students are  identified to enter the SIFE program, our challenge is to find ways to teach students to read and write in English and acquire  content knowledge when they have limited, if any, literacy skills in any language and may also have serious affective issues as  well.    In order to service students who are struggling, each team has provided extra services:  including one-on-one work with a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      paraprofessional, small group instruction, and after school tutoring.  School-wide, a Saturday enrichment program has been  established, and changes in student programs (such as an extra language arts period) have been made.  Our SIFE model requires three important features:  •     An intensive Language Arts period is held during the regular core daily program to accelerate learning taught by a specially  trained literacy ESL licensed teacher in small group settings of five to ten students in which instruction is guided by individual  students’ needs.  This class is focused on reading comprehension, reading fluency and vocabulary development based on high  interest topics drawn from the social studies curriculum.     b)     Instructional Plan for Newcomer ELL Students:  Newcomers to the school, along with their parents, meet initially with a guidance counselor who assesses their needs and  academic development during intake.  All new students and their parents receive an orientation developed by the guidance  staff along with the parent coordinator.  All students new to the United States and to NYC are given the NYSITELL exam which  assesses the students English language abilities.  For students transferring in from NYC schools, test results are reviewed and  students are then matched with teams of teachers who it is felt would best meet the needs of the specific student.  The  teachers meet in teams to discuss the specific needs of all new students.  A plan is formulated to best meet the needs of each  particular student.     c)     Instructional Plan for Developing ELL's:  The plan for developing ELLs receiving  service for 4-6 years consists of ongoing support and mentoring. ELLs with 4-6 years of  service are placed in appropriate classes to best meet their needs and continue their English language development.  Their  teachers meet regularly in teams to discuss the needs fo the specific students.  A plan is formulated and updated regularly to  meet the needs of each student.       d)     Instructional Plan for Long Term ELL's:  The plan for long term ELLs consists of ongoing support and intervention.  Each case is evaluated on a case to case  basis.  Smaller groups may be provided to accomdate some interventions.       e)     Instructional Plan for Former ELL's up to 2 years after exiting ELL status):  As students reach proficiency and test out through the NYSESLAT assessment, they continue to receive a full program of ESL  services to support and provide for their continued academic growth and development of English proficiency.   Students who  are determined to have reached proficiency continue to receive support from their teachers as needed per CR Part 154.2.  All  former ELLs receive their mandated .5 unit of ESL services.  Former ELLs continue to receive the mandated testing  accomodations after they they have tested out on the NYSESLAT exam.            6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    Instructional strategies and grade level materials used to provide ELL-SWDs access to academic areas and accelerate English  language development:  The guidance counselor, Assistant Principal and Special Education teacher review all IEP’s for ELL-SWD’s to ensure that all IEP  mandates are being met and to ensure that the ELL-SWD student receives the appropriate program in the least restrictive  environment.  After reviewing the mandates of the IEP, the full team of teachers meet with the Special Education teacher to  discuss specific instructional strategies that would prove valuable to the growth of the ELL-SWD student and follow the  mandates of the IEP.  The team along with the guidance counselor, Assistant Principal and Special Education teacher ensure  that all of the mandates in the IEP are carried out. If additional support is needed the student is provided with additional  support services as per the IEP.  Requests are made, as needed, for assistive technology such as I pads outfitted with speaking  technology for a student whose speech is effected by paralysis.      The ELL-SWD students who may have learning needs undiagnosed in their home country, have been here a short time and are  only beginning to learn English, and/or have experienced serious disruptions and inadequacies in their earlier academic  preparation are addressed by creating instructional opportunities geared to their needs. Students with Individualized   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      Education Plans (IEP's) receive full support from the instructional teams to which they belong. Those students are included in  mainstream classes, and receive additional services in language, counseling, and adaptive physical education. In biweekly  meetings, the teachers of our instructional teams meet to review the progress of these and other students. Teams of teachers  along with the guidance counselors meet regularly throughout the semester to review the progress of each student in  accordance with their specific IEP.  .  Some of the specific instructional strategies for ELLs depending on the requirements of their specific IEP’s include: Teachers,  guidance counselors and special education teacher meet regularly to discuss the individual needs of the ELL-SWD  student.  Once students have been identified as ELL-SWD and a program has been established following the mandates of their  IEP, the challenge is to find ways to teach the student the skills they require while also teaching the student to read, write and  speak English and acquire content knowledge when they may have limited, if any academic skills, have specific disabilities as  described in their IEP and may have serious affective issues as well.  In order to service the ELL-SWD student in the least  restrictive environment, students are mainstreamed into the regular academic class and each team provides extra services:  including one-on-one work and small group instruction.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL students are provided with intervention in the content areas based upon need. Need is deteremined through a variety of  avenues: formal and informal assessments. The ELL teacher works with the classroom teacher to determine and provide the  appropriate curriculum for intrevention.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  All of our targeted intervention program are geared towards supporting all of our ELL subgroups.     • Small group instruction is provided for students in need of smaller settings.  These classes occur throughout the day based on  need.  Each class is instructed by a special education teacher specializing in mathematics and English Language Arts.  •The Ella Baker Schooll is also closely conneceted with many programs that come in to provide services that build acedemic  foundations through self esteem:  Everybody Wins Reading program, Manice Educational Center, S'Cool Sounds         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      None.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   ELL students are considered for all intervention services during school and after school. Aside from a students mandated  services, the school provides an afterschool program that supports the various needs of all students.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   Approximately 3% of our students are ELLs and therefore all of our programs are equal access.  In addition to the support and  intervention services listed in the answer to question five of this section, we have the following after-school classes; while they  may not all be “academic” in theme, all of them are designed to continue students’ language development through activities  incorporating listening, speaking, reading, and writing of English:                 •     Read Ahead  •     S'Cool Sounds  •     InterSchool Orchestra  •            Manice Education Center  •     Asphalt Green Swimming Program  •     92  nd   Street Y Music Introduction Class   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         All ELLs and former ELLs are invited to participate in the activities listed above     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  A variety of instructional materials are used to support ELLs.  Students have access to computers and computer programs that  can display native language, students can use computers and i-pads to gather content material.  Instructional materials such as  graphic organizers and templates are used to scaffold student learning, understanding and dissemination of material.  These  types of materials are provided and accessable to all students.           13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   The LAP team meets weekly to review the progress of each child. As a group, LAP members present student work as  participants in case studies, and the team discusses strategies for adressing children's needs. We review and make  recommendations for individuals and groups of students. These sessions are geared towards moving students through their  continuum.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   Our instructional teams meet regularly to ensure that required services and supports correspond to ELLs' age and grade  levels.  All of the required services for our ELLs are available to students. We use a wide array of resources in our school  including teacher-made materials, text books on a range of levels, trade books at many reading levels, and a large variety of  non-text hands-on materials.  In addition, our school has wireless access in all classrooms and students use the Internet to  access resources.  If a teacher or instructional team is having problems locating published materials that are appropriate to the  age of the ELLs then the instructional teams work together to create an adapt material which will be appropriate to the age  level of the ELL.  Our teachers understand the importance of utilizing materials and resources for the ELL’s appropriate age  level in order to keep them engaged in learning.  In addition, instructional teams are encouraged to attend professional  development workshops throughout the year in order to help them better meet the needs of ELLs with age and grade level  appropriate to the content of the classes.  We find that use of technology allows us to scaffold and differentiate to support all  students.  Our arts partnerships create opportunities for students to shine in a variety of ways.  For example through  filmmaking, coding, cooking or theatre students who may struggle academically gain confidence and can demonstrate abilities  outside of the standard academic skills.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    A variety of instructional materials are used to support ELLs.  Students have access to computers and computer programs that  can display native language, students can use computers and i-pads to gather content material.  Instructional materials such as  graphic organizers and templates are used to scaffold student learning, understanding and dissemination of material.  These  types of materials are provided and accessable to all students.           16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Prior to the school year, new ELL students are identified by the parent coordinator and the assistant principal.  These 2 people  work with the child to:  - learn the layout of the school  -clarify the schedule and routines of the school  - introduce to classroom teacher and support staff     The school guidence counselor and assistant principal work with teachers to develop appropriate  community building  activities that allow access to all students.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  1. Professional Development Plan:  To achieve our instructional goals and implement our core beliefs an extensive structure of professional development has been  planned.  This professional development structure is on-going and fully integrated into our school structure.    The principal repository of professional development has been the instructional teams in the school.  Our entire school is  divided into learning communities.  The teachers meet weekly to plan, develop and implement their curriculum and  instruction.  They develop and revise curriculum and model collaborative work for their students.       We continue to work closely with academic experts exploring several approaches in order to develop a toolbox of strategies  that all of our teachers can use with students and share throughout content areas.  We have PD meetings every Monday from  3:00-5:00pm, some examples of recent and upcomings topics include: Restorative Justice training, Smartboard Instuction,  Math Strings and Inclusive classrooms.  For this year’s goals, the instructional teams met and completed the following school wide goals to help them address the  Common Core Learning Standards.    Category: Language and Content Integration:  Goal 1: To create units that help students develop disciplinary and interdisciplinary academic language.     Category: Localized Autonomy and Responsibility:  Goal #2: To develop students’ skills towards the higher levels of the New York State Performance Standards Consortium’s  rubric in each discipline area and to work with students on their personal and academic strengths and weaknesses through  projects.     In order to assist our teachers of ELLs in supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards we have  planned to offer the multiple opportunities for professional development throughout the year.  These professional  development sessions are facilitated by fellow faculty members and school administrators.    1.  Classroom Environment and Assessment (September and October):   •     Supporting ELLs and IEP students to access a rigorous curriculum  •     Building a supportive classroom environment from the start  •     Using baseline and benchmark assessments that are aligned to the Common Core  2.  Alignment of Curriculum Meetings (November/December)  •     Sharing unit maps and getting feedback on how to improve use of discipline specific academic language  •     Sharing baseline and benchmark assessments and getting feedback on how to develop students; skills towards higher  levels   3.  Curriculum Sharing: (January)  •     All teachers bring portfolio project task and sample student work to share  •     Collect feedback and rubrics   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57                 2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Support Provided to Staff to Assist ELL's Transitioning from middle school to high school:  Professional development for all staff is geared toward improving ELL academic achievement and language development; we  build teacher capacity in these areas by a variety of means:     a. Peer observations: teachers observe each other teach and write reflective letters pinpointing new strategies and techniques  they have learned as a result.     b. Conferences: faculty attend a variety of external conferences each year in order to keep abreast of new trends in ESL and  their content areas.     Minimum ELL Training for all staff:  All of our teaching staff, which includes teachers who do not hold ESL or Bilingual licenses, are provided with a series of  professional opportunities.  The professional development program focuses on providing teachers with various instructional  strategies for teaching English Language Learners.  It also focuses on how to prepare ELLs to meet and exceed the NYC and NYS  performance and learning Standards.  These professional development sessions are facilitated by fellow faculty members and  school administrators.    1.     Two 2-hour session on supporting SIFE and IEP students to access a rigorous curriculum (September)  2.     One 1-hour session on Academic language for ELL students: (October)  •     Introduction on language development and our students  •     Sharing unit maps on teams and coming up with interdisciplinary academic language that the team can focus on together  with ELL students.   3.     Two-2 hour sessions on Language and Content Integration for ELLs: (Nov.)  •     Various language and content integration workshops led by the Internationals Network for Public Schools   4.

One 1- hour session: Native language Use in the Classroom (March)  •     How to incorporate native language and use it as a support for students in the classroom          Content Integration: (April)  •     Social and Academic language sentence matching        Since all of our staff participates in the above-mentioned professional development opportunities throughout the school year,  plus many more staff members avail themselves of the professional development opportunities listed in part 2 above,  everyone receives many more hours than the current 50% mandated total for bi-lingual/ESL teachers.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   We will hold annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs at least two time during each school year.  At these meetings  teachers will discuss the goals of the program, the language development process of the individual student, the language  proficiaency assessment resluts as well as the student's language development needs in all content areas.     In order to ensure that parent needs are accomodated we will utilize our faculty members in order to make phone calls to  parents to arrange individual meetings.  When a faculty member is not available to translate we will utiize the DOE Translation  Unit to ensure that all parents receive information about their individual parent meeting in their native langauge.        2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  The Ella Baker School provides all parents including ELL parents/guardians with the opportunity to attend a variety of literacy,  math, and homework workshops, so that they can better assist in the education and learning or their children at home.          The faculty colaborates with the PTA to hold specific content area evenings where teachers share strategies , techniques  and understanding.  For the 2015-2016 school year, teachers have developed:  - Math Night 2 times  -Science Night  -Literacy Workshops for younger and older students              Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Laura Garcia, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Ella Baker School                                                                              School DBN: 02M225  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The Ella Baker School reviews the Home Language Identification Surveys (HLIS) of every new entrant to determine  families’    language needs. We also rely on Emergency Contact cards, parent and teacher surveys and teacher reports of  students with parents requiring translation services. Using these sources, Ella Baker maintains a running list of  families who need written or oral translated school documents and translation services at Parent-Teacher  Conferences or other school events. With this information a report is generated and regularly updated on the  google Drive for all staff members to referr to.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62     2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    Ella Baker has a limited  number of parents with  translation needs.    • Ella Baker has 9 families  who have identified  themselves as Spanish  speaking.    • Ella Baker has 1 family  who has identified  themselves as Portuguese  speaking.    Communication to these  parents is translated when  needed. However, the  teachers and school make  it a priority to  communicate    orally to these families, as  9 out of 10 of these  families are proficient  English speakers.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.            Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.

The Ella Baker School makes every  effort to distribute translations to      Families    Include procedures to ensure timely  provision of translated documents      to parents.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63     families requesting information. Such  documents are school calendars,  reminders of 1/2 days and closures,  testing information, PTA meetings,  school events such as the annual  potluck and field days, and when  necessary, student narratives, which  describe student work and progress.  These documents are distributed the  1 st week of school and 2 weeks prior  to any major event. Additionally, this  information updated daily on our  website and school calendar.            2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as   parent-teacher   conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.        Meeting Name    Month/Frequency of Meetings    How does your school plan to provide   interpretation service(s)?          The Ella Baker School holds 2  student-led family conferences a  year. At these meetings, at the  request of the parent and or teacher,  we have a staff translator, someone  from the building, or use Title III  Translation Services Funds to secure  an outside translator.            3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.               Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.                Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64     Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The Ella Baker School follows the translation notification requirements as outlined by the Regulation of the  Chancellor. Our school provides each parent whose primary language is other than English a copy of the Bill of Parents  Rights and Responsibilities, which outlines translations services that they are eligible to receive and a welcome sign  posted in the front office states the various languages that we can readily accommodate. It is known that all  notification documents can be found at the Translation and Interpretation Unit's intranet site.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       During family conferences and other formal meetings, familes that receive extra translation serveices or parents  flagged as needing services are asked about the communication that they receive. Following these meeting specific  alterations are made to accommodate familes needing more or less translation services. Focus groups made up of  parents inclusive of all cultures and languages represented at Ella Baker will meet to gather additional feedback.  These sessions will take place during pre planned PTA meetings during the 2015-2016 school year.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65
