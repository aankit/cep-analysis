This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      PS 14 is a school community that strives to develop respectful, trustworthy individuals with a desire to become life- long learners and good citizens. We hold our students to the highest academic standards while providing them with  the direction, support and encouragement they need to be successful. Our students will empower themselves and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      inspire others to be tolerant and understanding. P.S. 14 is focused on delivering targeted high quality instruction that  is rigorous and cognitively engages all learners across all content areas.          2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The Senator John D. Calandra Elementary School is an elementary school located in the Throgs Neck Community of  the Bronx with 580 students from Kindergarten through Grade 5. Boys account for 56% of the students enrolled and  girls account for 44%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2017-2018 was 93.1%.   P.S. 14 is focused on delivering targeted high quality instruction that is rigorous and cognitively engages all learners  across all content areas. In conjunction with District 8 Leadership, there are a variety of partnerships for academics  such as: Teachers College Columbia University, The Yale Center for Social and Emotional Intelligence, The New York  Historical Society, and The National Teachers Network for Mathematics, (NTN). These partnerships develop the whole  child and support families.    PS 14 is proud to be a Community Learning School. We strive to provide wrap-around services for our students and  families. We provide low or no cost dental/vision services, provide our parents with a school based food and clothing  bank, and school day rich in the arts.          3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The school population is comprised of 63% Hispanic, 29% White, 6% African American,and 2% Asian students. The  student body includes 7% English Language Learners and 21% Special Education Students. ENL are currently at 40%  Entering, 15% Emerging, 30% Transitioning, and 15% Commanding. Families currently speak a number of languages  including Spanish, Bengali, and Arabic.    Classes are designed to address students specific needs via pull out and or push in services. Classroom teachers use  student data for small group instruction and planning. The school continues personalize the learning of students by  adapting and modifying the curriculum based upon a student's needs and interests.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The Great Schools element being our key focus is Student Achievement. The 2017-2018 NYS Testing Data shows at  10% increase in ELA and 13% increase in Math. We continue to fully implement the Teachers College Units of Study as  a Project School. In mathematics we continue to implement Envisions and KEMS.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 08X014   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   547   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   n/a                                                 1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35       Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S.014 Senator John Calandra, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S.014 Senator John Calandra will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   P.S.014 Senator John Calandra's  Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the  needs of all parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with  disabilities. The school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent  involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation  through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of  parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.      In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     Title I Priority and Focus Schools and the parents of students served in the Title I program must jointly agree  upon the use of these additional funds to support increased parent engagement/education to enable parents  to effectively support their child’s learning.     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing  technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;     maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;         provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State   accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality  Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;     host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise   parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right  to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118  and other applicable sections under the ESSA;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39           schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the  Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;            P.S.014 Senator John Calandra will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

During push in the ENL instructor, Mr. Alonzo, will coordinate  with the classroom teacher to parallel teach and use small group instruction.  During pull out  time Mr. Alonzo will use flexible groupings.  The start time is 8:00-2:20 daily from September 5,  2018 through to June 26, 2019. Under the funding of Title III, PS 14 offers supplemental  language resources are utilized for instructional purposes in the areas of Spanish, Arabic,  Chinese Urdu, Bengali, and Albanian education programs to ensure that our ENL population has  an adequate opportunity to acquire a second language and attain English proficiency while  meeting state academic achievement standards.   Newcomer ENL students span all grade levels and different language backgrounds. In addition to  the freestanding ENL program Title III will incorporate supplemental activities, including  vocabulary and phonemic development, and materials specific for Newcomers and Immigrant  ENL students, as well as all of PS 14's ENL students which include "Words Their Way" for ENL  students (at no cost to Title III), Step by Step Language Skills,  and Readers' Theater materials.   Through supplemental teaching beyond the mandated units, the ENL Afterschool program's  objective of is to provide our ENL students, especially the sub-group of Newcomer ENL  students,  small group instruction to accelerate language acquisition with a focus on developing  academic language in the content areas of ENL and Mathematics through Readers' Theater  activities and Multi-Cultural research projects.   Both the Readers' Theater and Multi-Cultural  projects will culminate with a Parents' Night in which parents will be active participants in their  children's learning experiences, promoting socio-emotional support.    Data reviewed from the NYSESLAT, DRA scores, NYS ELA and Math scores indicate that the  ENL students, especially Newcomers and those at Beginner Proficiency levels, are not scoring as  highly or proficiently as their peers.  In order to raise the reading levels and skills, the Title III  program will focus on reading fluency and comprehension.  Through the use of Readers’  Theaters programs, “Speak Out! Readers’ Theater”, First through Fifth grade ENL students will  build reading stamina, expression, fluency, and comprehension, as well as interpersonal social  skills while interacting with their peers.  The students will work cooperatively and  collaboratively to create a theater production at least once every 6 weeks.  To increase parental  involvement in their children’s’ education, these theater productions will be an event for parents  to participate in and watch in order to engage socially and academically.  In addition to Reader’s Theater, the ENL students in Third-Fifth grade will work on Multi- Cultural research projects which will build their reading and writing skills and strategies for  Non-Fiction Literacy.  Through the use of technology, research strategies, and Non-Fiction  Literacy models, such as National Geographic for Kids, these ENL students will research other  cultures and topics they find interesting to create a project of their choosing such as a display, a  report, a recording, or presentation.  Parents will be invited to participate in a Cultural Feast,  where they will get a chance to engage socially and academically with their children and other  ENL parents.    In addition, Newcomers will have targeted small group instruction which will focus on  foundations of English language acquisition.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?       A school-wide ELA diagnostic assessment is provided for all grades in September to assess each child's strengths and  weaknesses. Assessments in ELA are given bi-monthly to analyze progress. Based on these results, the students are grouped  for reading. The TCRWP Up the Ladder Assessments, which are administered to grades 3-5, as well as the quarterly assessment  of Fountas and Pinnell reading levels for all grades, also aid the classroom teacher and ENL teacher in planning and  implementing differentiated instruction for the ELL population.       The Teachers College Running Record  Assessments are administered during the fall, winter, and spring of the academic  year. The Kindergarten grade is provided this assessment twice: in January and in the mandated spring. This assessment tool  aids classroom teachers and the ENL teacher in determining the strengths and weaknesses that the students have in reading  and writing during the early grades. These assessments aid classroom teachers in planning and differentiating instruction for  the ELL students in their classroom.        Modifications are also considered when providing assessments, such as: separate location, , bilingual dictionaries,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         simultaneous use of an English test along with an alternate language edition of the test, as well as oral translation for lower  incidence language is provided. Written responses in the student's native language are also permitted.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The structures we have in place to support this effort are the stand alone ENL mandatory minutes in which pulled out for small  group instruction, as well as push-in program where the ENL teacher supports the teacher and ENL students in the  classroom.  In addition, the ENL and classroom teachers common plan to ensure alignment in the curriculum and  differentiated instruction that will increase student achievement in the ENL population.  We also have the ENL after-school  program which supports students with their needs based on assessment as well as instructional support to develop students'  testing skills.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of P.S. 14's ENL program is measured by the individual student's achievement on the NYSESLAT exam.  For  students in grades 3-5, a score of 3 or better on the NYS ELA and Mathematics exams.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Structures we have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered is differentiation to support  students based on their areas in need of improvement.  Additional time is allocated to those students who need extra support  with the ENL teacher. Academic intervention is provided by our AIS teacher for those targeted students based on the  summative data.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   General content instruction for all ELLs is provided at the Tier 1 instructional level with the ELL teacher and classroom teacher  collaborating on lessons targeted at increasing language acquisition and academic proficiency. When data from formal and  informal assessments by both ELL and classroom teachers indicate an intense need for intervention, students are placed at  Tier 2 or Tier 3 levels as needed. Instruction at these Tiers is tailored to meet the academic and language needs of the ELLs, as  well as the specific domains in which they are at risk. Students are provided with increasingly intensive, targeted instruction  designed to match their learning needs. These needs are determined by individual student performance on periodically  administered assessments.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data patterns across proficiency levels reveal that, with the exception of a few, students are achieving English proficiency  at a consistent rate with 1-4 years of service. The data patterns also reveal that students are achieving English proficiency at a  consistent pace with their ELL peers. The scores of the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL tests are consistently and conversely related  with the students' scores of the formative assessments given, such as the NYS ELA tests.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The structure we have in place to disseminate these finding is the EDAT report which is data on ELL students that show  information about progress and test results from prior year. This information if disseminate to classroom teachers and  adminstration.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   PS. 14 uses a Freestanding ENL program that follows the push-in model with some periods of pull-out of bridged  grades in order to align with the number of mandated minutes of necessary instruction. ELLs are grouped in general  education classes and are supported with push-in ENL instruction. The ENL teacher pushes in during ELA and Literacy  blocks in which the ELLs are grouped and works with the students during their content classes. Most groups are  heterogenous, with mixed proficiency levels. The ENL teacher both differentiates instruction and facilitates the group  following the content taught by the classroom teacher. Flexible grouping for academic intervention, differentiation,  and integrating ELLs into heterogenous classes is practiced based on student needs and learning targets. Teachers  work collaboratively to regularly group and regroup ELLs and English proficient students to maximize instruction and  learning opportunities.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              The ENL Teacher follows the school schedule to ensure that all ELLs receive the mandated number of minutes. The ENL  teacher schedules preparation periods to coincide with the classroom teacher to facilitate common planning. Where possible,  bilingual content materials are made available by the ENL teacher to ensure student learning and native language support by  use of bilingual glossaries, translated materials, and native language literature.            ELLs in the entering level of language development will receive 3 units of study per week (540 minutes). They will receive  one unit of Stand-Alone ENL, two units of Integrated ENL/ELA. ELLs in the emerging level of language development will receive  two units (360 minutes) of ENL instruction per week. One unit of study will be Integrated ENL/ELA instruction and the other  unit of study will be stand-alone ENL instruction. Students at the transitioning and emerging levels will receive 180 minutes  (one unit) of Integrated ENL instruction per week. This will come in the form of one unit of study in integrated ENL/Content  Area instruction. Commanding students/former ELLs continue to receive services for an additional two years. They will receive  90 minutes (.5 unit) of student per week of integrated ENL in ELA/Content Area instruction per week. In the content area  instruction, ENL strategies will be infused to maximize comprehension, cognitive development and academic language  acquisition. Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) will be provided with additional instructional time. Extended  day programs, one to one tutoring, peer tutoring, and Saturday academies will be provided for this purpose.            Native language support is provided through the classroom libraries where a selection of Spanish language books that are  reading level and grade appropriate. In addition, students are encouraged to celebrate their native heritage through school  assemblies and programs.            School teams that include the content area teachers, ENL teacher, and any support instructors, meet regularly to examine  data (ARIS/NYSESLAT, lesson video tapes, students' self assessments, diagnostics). This data is used for individual student  profiles and to monitor curriculum alignment.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.               In addition to the push-in program, the ENL teacher works with small groups to provide specific, targeted instruction  using ENL strategies in a stand-lone model.  ENL programs used by the ENL teacher include the "Words Their Way for EL"   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      program and "Hello English" for the lower grades, as well as "On Our Way to English", by Rigby Guided Reading for the upper  elementary grades. The programs for the lower grades concentrate on building vocabulary, phonics, and introduction to  reading aligned with the CCSS. The programs for the upper grades focs on extending vocabulary, increasing decoding  strategies, and comprehension skills of ELLs aligned with CCSS. All programs have a writing component in conjunction with the  reading component and are CCSS aligned. Push-ins during Mathematics periods concentrate on vocabulary support during the  lesson to improve upon student comprehension of content aligned with CCSS.                 Retained ELLs receive targeted instruction based upon recommendations and data from the classroom teacher, as well  as from the ENL teacher.                 Strategies used for ELLs include modeling, audiovisuals, semantic mapping, graphic organizers, explicit vocabulary  development, activating prior knowledge, and engaging in opportunities to converse using academic language with peers. ELLs  participate in Title III funded after-school and Saturday classes.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      P.S. 14 does not currently implement bilingual programs. However, native languages are supported by providing a translator  if needed, as well as a bilingual teacher if needed. Bilingual texts, videos, and any other materials to make content  comprehensible in second language acquisition, as well as in the native language.      5.

Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Instruction for the different sub-groups of ELLs is differentiated as follows:   a. SIFE students- Extra assistance will be offered in many areas. One-on-one peer tutoring will be provided. The SIFE student  can participate in after-school programs (extended day) offered on Tuesdays and Thursdas from 2:40-3:20.   b. For an ELL student in U.S. schools less than three years, the extended-time program, which meets twice per week from  September through June, the extended-day program, and peer mentoring will be offered. Vocabulry building will be the core  of the ESL instruction for this group.   c. For ELLs in the ENL program from 4-6 years, the extended-day, extended-time program, Saturday Academy, and the  required units of ENL instruction are provided. These students are immersed in vocabulary development and test preparation.   d. Long term ELLs, those with over 6 years of ENL instruction are provided with all of the programs and opportunities that are  offered to other ELL students, in addition to targeted instruction based on their individual needs as noted by their NYSESLAT  scores.   e. Former ELLs are provided with continued ENL services for an additional two years. They receive .5 unit of study (90 minutes)  per week of Integrated ENL in ELA/Content Area.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Students who are identified as having special needs are provided with extra materials and visuals to aid in content  comprehension. "The Words Their Way" for ELLs is a curriculum specific utilized to provide access to academic content areas  and accelerate English language development. They are also given extra time to complete their tasks and are placed small  groups that they can receive individual assistance. They are provided with grade-level material in smaller parts that are  differentiated to meet their special needs as identified on their IEPs.       7.

Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Once an ELL is identified as "at-risk" and need intervention using the RtI framework, instruction is tailored to meet the needs  of these students in the specific domains for which they are at risk. The programs used for intervention are: "The Language of  Math", "Perfect Learning Corp.", "Reading Rods Phonics Program" , ETA Cuisenaire, and "Words Their Way for English  Learners".  In addition to these programs, classroom teachers for grades K-2 use the "Leveled Literacy Intervention Program",  Fountas & Pinnell.        In addition to the listed programs, ELLs in the ENL program for 4-6 years , the extended-time program, the extended-day  program, Saturday Academy, and the required units of ENL instruction are provided. These students are immersed in  vocabulary development. Long-term ELLs, those with over 6 years of eNL instruction, are provided with all of the programs and  opportunities that are offered to other ELLs, in addition to targeted instruction based on their individual needs as noted by  their NYSESLAT scores. Students identified as having special needs are provided with small groups to receive individualized  assistance. All ELLs in the program for over 3 years are offered a targeted after-school program, Saturday Academy, and one- to-one tutoring to increase their language development.        In order to promote a better home/school partnership, as well as a further extension of services, P.S. 14 provides a  translated version of the weekly homework to all parents of ELLs. This allows for parents to better participate in the assistance  with homework and overall education of their children.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the 2015-2016 school year, some considerations will be that new funding will be spent on expanding the native language  and bilingual resources to more languges. The demographic of ELLs has been shifting to include a wider variety of languages as  opposed to just Spanish. Native language support resources will include: Chinese and Albanian bilingual dictionaries and books  if available. A Newcomer extended-day program will also be considered dependent upon new enrollment numbers in order for  ELLs to accelerate in meeting the CCSS.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Paste response to question here:        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs are given equal access to all school programs offered at P.S. 14. ELLs are strongly encouraged to participate in after  school activities such as Bingo Night, Jeopardy Night, and any school dances. Through the use of Title III funding, additional  materials and resources will be purchased for use in the ENL After-School Program at P.S. 14. This runs on Mondays for grades  1-2, and Tuesdays for grades 3-5. Activities in this progam include collaborative community projects, readers' theater, and  other group activities that will foster oral and academic language skills.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials used to support ELLs include many visual aids, hands-on manipulatives, realia, and bilingual resources.  Classrooms are equipped with computers and educational activities that allow for technology to be incorporated into lessons.  Songs, and audio-visuals are used consistently, as well. Classrooms are equipped with Promethian Boards and document  readers to facilitate interactive learning.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   A minimum of 25% Native language support in the ENL program consists of allowing some native language collaborative work  among students when it is needed academically. In addition to bilingual dictionaries,  any texts and resources available in  native language is encouraged for use to represent and include students' native culture.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All ELLs are placed in the appropriate grade level for their age upon arrival. Materials and resources used are developmentally  appropriate and on grade-level.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Instructional materials used to support ELLs include many visual aids, hands-on manipulatives, realia, and bilingual resources.  Classrooms are equipped with computers and educational activities that allow for technology to be incorporated into lessons.  Songs, and audio-visuals are used consistently, as well. Classrooms are equipped with Promethian Boards and document  readers to facilitate interactive learning.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   ELLs that enroll throughout the school year are paired with a classroom buddy that is from the same background and speaks  the same native language. This is usually another ELL that is at a higher proficiency level, as well as one who is familiar with  school and classroom procedures. This is valuable in assisting the Newcomer in acclimating to his or her new environment.  Classroom teachers are given materials that will assist in the facilitation of English language acquisition, such as Newcomer  books from the Rigby, "On Our Way to English" program, as well as bilingual picture dictionaries.      For Newcomers, P.S. 14 also provides the following:   - Extended Day Program where students practice vocabulary and pronunciation with the teacher and the Rigby computer  program: "On Our Way to English"   -Language games and role playing activities to help bolster students' self-esteem  -Songs and finger plays (lower grades)   -Role playing  -Reader's Theater  -Classroom is organized in order to facilitate interaction among peers, as well as for teachers to foster the development of  academic objectives and language  -Use of Native language is encouraged to support English language acquisition among all four domains  -Teachers activate students' prior knowledge in order to help ELLs gain confidence and grasp learning objectives  -Use of graphic organizers and extensive modeling for written work to help prepare for ELA     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         A professional development plan, which includes all staff that works with ELLs: clasroom teachers, cluster teachers,  educational assistants, parent coordinator, counselor, and all other staff members. Areas covered in the staff development  include ENL and the content areas, the facilitation of langauge development, instructional adaptations for ELLs, differentiated  lesson planning, communicating with parents, and ELLs in special education programs. The topics included are the theory of  second langauge acquisition, lesson planning using ENL methodology such as TPR (total physical response), and the  identification and placement of ELLs.   The ENL teacher is regularly sent to professional development throughout the school year. The ENL teacher shares the  information received providing professional development to all teachers of ELLs. This training is provided during professional  development days and other times. The certified ENL teacher will provide professional development to the classroom teachers  to assist them with preparing differentiated lessons for ELLs. Staff development for teachers to learn ENL methodologies and  strategies will also be provided. Topics covered will include: the process of identifying and placing ELLs into differentiated  groups, the social difficulties faced by immigrant children as they strive to adjust to a new country, and the challenges faced by  language minority children as they experience what is known as "Language Shock". In addition, the obstacles the ELLs  encounter in their efforts to become proficient in the English language and how teachers can help their ELLs overcome some of  these barriers will also be discussed.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Various forms for differentiated instruction discussed include the use of seating arrangements to improve the opportunities for  interaction and acquisition of education in the context of social climate, the use of cognates to facilitate vocabulary  development, and promoting a safe environment where ELLs feel free to take risks as they engage in learning a new language.  The critical aspect of the relationship with parents is covered, as well as how to communicate effectively with both parents and  caregivers. The use of cooperative learning to promote interaction among students and the development of scaffolding  activities will help ELLs to organize their thoughts and develop comprehension.   The school provides professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the needs of ELLs.  A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 80  must be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating  language and content instruction for English language learners. For the ENL teacher, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the  required professional development hours must be dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area  instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for  ELLs.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   P.S.14 is in partnership with Learning Leaders, Metro Plus Health Services, and Our Child Safety Services to assist parents with  school related issues.  A program of adult education is in place to help parents provide assistance to their children in  completing homework and other academic related issues.  Workshops and meetings are held by the parent coordinator and a  NYS certified bilingual/ESL teacher on staff.  A series of ESL workshops are offered to the community directly related to ESL  issues and concerns.     A parent survey was created to establish parental needs.  These are being addressed in the meetings and workshops offered  during the school year 2013-2014, which include:  •     Open School Week     •     ARIS-student academic history         •     ESL Parent Workshop              •     Fast Food Nation                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59            •     Homework Help                 •     Parent Volunteer Training             •     IEP/ELL                     •     Child Abuse                     •     Special Needs                     •     Developing Young Readers             •     Reading to Learn                 •     ARIS Parent Link                 •     ESL Parent workshop                 •     Help your child ”Write from the Start”     •     Helping your child grow as a writer         •     Math workshop                 •     Anti-stress workshop, parent and child      •     Healthy eating                        Additional ESL workshops will be held for parents through out the year.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Ira Schulman, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Yes/No    Evelyn    DeStafano   Parent Coordinator   yes   yes          * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      When parents or guardians come to P.S. 14 to register their child, they are asked to complete the Home Language  Identification Survey form. During the registration process, the current ENL teacher conducts an informal  interview with the parents and child to gain a deeper understanding of his or her language proficiency and  preference. The aid of a translator is enlisted if deemed necessary or at the request of the parent.   The parents also attend a Parent Orientation where they watch the Parent Orientation video (which explains the  three program options and is available in 13 languages). Attendance records, staff members present at the  orientation, and languages used other than English are recorded using existing procedures established in the  school. The orientation is in a language or mode of communication that the parent or guardian best understands.  The school would contact the Translation and Interpretation Unit if they require an interpreter for any language  that is not spoken by the school staff.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      If parents are unable to attend the group orientation, an individual meeting is set up within the next few days  when parents can meet to discuss the program models and ask questions.    After parents are informed of all three program models at the parent orientation, they are provided with a Parent  Survey & Program Selection Form (in the parents’ preferred language), where parents can indicate their program  choice.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.
