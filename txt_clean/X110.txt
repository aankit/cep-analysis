This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At our school, we strive to provide a rigorous curriculum and instruction that engages students in cognitively  challenging learning activities in order to develop the conceptual understanding of complex materials and  opportunities for all learners to prepare for college and career.    We will continue striving to accomplish our school- wide mission:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Our school community is committed to providing our students with a rigorous educational program responsive to the  needs of individual students in order to ensure career and college readiness.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Context:   PS 110 is a PreK-5 school located in the South Bronx with a population of 445 students. The school population  includes 17.75% English language learners and 22.5% students with disabilities. Ninety five percent of the students  qualify for free lunch and 1% of the student population is in Student Temporary Housing.       Teachers work in collaboration with one another to improve instruction and pedagogy to meet the needs of our  diverse students. Intervention plans are in place to ensure that all students, including students with special needs and  English language learners are provided with quality instruction. English language learners (ELLs) are serviced mostly  following the push-in model. Teachers work cooperatively to help the students succeed. This model supports the  successful integration of ELLs into the general education class and strengthens alignment between ENL and general  course work. Lessons are differentiated by providing multiple opportunities to acquire content subject matter, to  process ideas, and to accommodate students’ individual needs.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The school population includes 12.6% English language learners and 28% students with disabilities. Ninety-one  percent of the students qualify for free lunch and 18% of the student population is in Student Temporary Housing.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Accomplishments:    ● Our school survey results indicate the following that 90% of teachers and parents are satisfied with our  instructional core. Eighty-three percent of the parents and teachers are satisfied with the systems for improvement,  and 85% of teachers and parents are satisfied with our school culture. In addition, 96% of the teachers agree that the  principal communicates a clear vision for the school. One hundred percent of the teachers agree that the school has  clear measures of progress for student achievement throughout the year.   ● Our School Quality Review results indicate a well- developed rating in the area of engaging rigorous and coherent  curricula, in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners and aligned to Common Core Learning Standards and/or  content standards. It also indicated a well-developed rating in the area of aligning curricula, using on-going  assessment and grading practices, and analyzing information on student learning outcomes to adjust decisions at the  team and classroom levels.   ● A comprehensive professional development plan and clear specific feedback further developed our teacher’s  effectiveness. Collaborative work on looking at student work supported the academic achievement of all students.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 110X, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       PS 110 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

This program will serve to help Newcomer ELL  students in grades 3 - 5 at risk of not meeting standards to make gains in their literacy and  mathematics skills so that they can work on the same level as their peers. Students will benefit  from additional focused instruction in a small group. Our newcomer ELLs who were enrolled in  the school the prior year have demonstrated levels of  achievement that were far behind or  approaching the standards on math assessments. Therefore, supporting their conceptual  understanding of math with additional focused small group instruction will be crucial to their  success. The ELL students in grades 3, 4 and 5 at the Entering and Emerging levels to be served  include those who have experienced a low rate of progress in literacy and/or math in their first  year entering New York City schools, or could be at risk of this happening. The targeted group  includes approximately 6 students in third grade, 4 students in fourth grade, and 6 students in  fifth grade. The program will also help second grade students work toward mastering basic  literacy skills, as well as assisting them in continuing to progress in mathematics using ENL  teaching strategies and, where applicable, native language materials to support them. 14 second  grade students will be targeted.    The program will take place on Wednesdays and Thursdays from October 24, 2018 to May 2,  2019 for a total of 33 sessions, meeting on the following dates: 11/1, 11/7, 11/8, 11/14, 11/21,  11/28, 11/29, 12/5, 12/6, 12/12, 12/13, 12/19, 12/20, 1/2, 1/3, 1/9, 1/10, 1/16, 1/17, 1/23, 1/24,  1/30, 1/31, 2/6, 2/7, 2/13, 2/14, 2/27, 2/28, 3/6, 3/7, 3/13, 3/14. Each session will be 2 hours long,  meeting from 2:30 to 4:30 PM.   Instruction will be delivered in English. Students will work with Time For Kids reading  materials and supplementary materials from the McGraw Hill WONDERS program. Math  instruction will incorporate supplemental material from the school’s READY NYCCLS math  books and NY Engage, translated into the students’ native language whenever possible. These  materials are used during the regular school day as well.  In addition to the After- School program, a Saturday class will be held for fourth and fifth grade  students at the transitioning and expanding level, who are struggling to progress toward  achieving a proficient score on the NYSESLAT exam, as well as not meeting standards by  scoring level 3 or higher on ELA and Mathematics exams. The program will help them improve  reading and writing in content areas, as well as practice solving word problems in mathematics. 9  fourth graders and 11 fifth graders are being targeted. The program will be held for a total of 12  Saturdays starting, 12/8 and continuing until March 23, and will meet the following dates:   12/8, 12/15, 12/22, 1/5, 1/12, 1/19, 1/26, 2/2, 2/9, 2/23, 3/2, 3/9  These sessions will each be 3 hours long, meeting from 8:30 - 11:30 AM.

Teachers in grades 2 - 5 will be invited to attend the workshop. Both presenting and  participating teachers will be paid at per session rates. The workshops will take place at the close  of the school day, from 2:30 to 4:30. This will help improve instruction in mathematics problem  solving, an area where many ELLs at the expanding level are struggling to succeed.    During each part of the workshop, math problems will be presented, selected based on evidence  of student difficulty shown in results from standardized and in-class routine assessments.  Manipulatives, visual pictures, vocabulary scaffolding charts, and demonstrations of  deconstructing problems in small groups will be presented, with time for attending teachers to  practice and debrief.     A second two-part workshop will be scheduled for Wednesday, May 8 and Thursday, May 9.  These two sessions will concentrate on using ENL strategies to develop writing among both  entering and emerging students, and transitioning and expanding level students. Teachers in  grades 2 - 5 will be invited to attend the workshop. Both presenting and participating teachers  will be paid at per session rates. The workshops will take place at the close of the school day,  from 2:30 to 4:30. At each grade level, work samples will be studied and work will be done to  identify features in the writing that indicate evidence of proficiency levels being performed at.  Teachers will then engage in practice to employ new strategies that would help students achieve  at higher levels.    The two presenting ENL teachers will create an agenda for each part of the workshop in  collaboration with one another, which will be reviewed by the school's principal. A copy will be  provided to each teacher participating in the workshops. The original agenda will then be stored  in a professional development binder for the school, maintained in the school's main office. A  copy will also be stored in a binder of ENL records maintained by the school's ENL teachers.    Teachers participating in the workshop will print their names and sign an attendance form for  each session. This attendance form will also be stored in a professional development binder for  the school located in the main office. A copy of the attendance will also be stored in an ENL  records binder maintained by the school's ENL teachers.      Additional records that will be stored in a professional development binder include handouts  distributed to the teachers and forms for participant feedback and reflection at the end of the  workshop sessions.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.        c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Currently, we use the TCRWP and the Fontas and Pinnell leveling system to assess our students' reading levels in  English. We use the Predictive Test in the Fall and in the Spring, the city-wide periodic assessments which assess  targeted reading skills. Most students who are at advanced English proficiency are reading on grade level. Knowing  the students' reading level gives the teachers the opportunity to match them to the resources used for instruction  and/or independent work. Planning includes activities that enhance expressive language in addition to receptive  language. We use the New York CIty Periodic Assessments for English Language Learners to determine English  learners' abilities in the four competencies - Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking, to determine readiness to  achieve on the NYSESLAT assessment for the same school year. Students are grouped for instruction by the ENL  teacher and the students' classroom teachers to provide additional focused instruction in those areas as needed.  Students complete a writing baseline, midline, and endlne to measure their ability to read and construct a coherent,  literate response to a fictional passage. These are selected by the school's coaches and administrators and are aligned  to standards of achievement as measured by New York State ELA exams.      87 percent of continuing ENL students in second grade scored high on the reading modality of the  2017 NYSESLAT exam. In this grade, students can be supported by the ENL teacher with strategy lessons to make  inferences and so high level reading work.  Among current ENL students in second grade, less than 1 percent of  students scored high in the reading modality. Second grade students will be supported by the ENL teacher with small  group lessons while their classes are doing literacy work, to build fundamental comprehension skills. 16 percent of  current grade 3 students scored high on the reading modality, while no students in the grade scored in the low or at  risk range. Grade three students will be supported by integrated ENL lessons that emphasize reading strategies to  improve inferential skills and answering questions based on text evidence. 41 percent of current third grade ENL  students who took the 2017 NYSESLAT exam scored high on the writing modality. These students will be met with in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72         small groups to push their writing skills to help them achieve at levels of 3 or 4 on the 2018 ELA exam. No current ENL  students in Grade 4  scored a 3 or 4 on the 2017 ELA exam, so intervention will be carried out with the ENL teacher  conducting small group lessons with students at each proficiency level to improve inference and ability to answer  questions based on text evidence.  36% of the current ENL students in grade 4 scored between a level 2 and 3 on the  2017 ELA exam, and will be worked on during other times in their class literacy block to focus specifically on inference  skills and vocabulary development to help push toward achieving level 3 scores on the 2017 ELA Exam. All 3 ENL  students currently in Grade 5 who took last year's ELA exam had scores approaching Level 2, so these students will be  targeted to work with in a small group by the ENL teacher to focus on inference and ability to answer questions based  on text-evidence to push their scores to be at a level 2 or higher.         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Weekly meetings at each grade level between classroom teachers and the ENL teacher take place in which student progress is  discussed and focused instruction is planned as needed. Information about student performance is also recorded on data  sheets, and shared among the teachers working with the students so that they can see student performance data to inform  their discussions at weekly meetings. During these meetings, teachers also look at student work samples to identify signs of  improvement, qualities of strong work, and areas of need.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Baselines are measured by the number of students who advance from Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding levels  as evidenced by the previous year's NYSESLAT results, as well as student reading performance in Fontas and Pinnell reading  assessments and the administration of a writing baseline. Student progress and areas of need are measured the administration  of additional Fontas and Pinnell assessments, a writing midline assessment, and the New York City Periodic Assessment of  English Language Learners.    Among ENL students currently in first grade, 70% scored high on the reading modality of last year's NYSESLAT Exam, and 50%  scored high on the modaliy of writing, so whole class Tier 1 instruction in writing will receive emphasis while small groups of  students will work with an ENL teacher during independent work time to push their reading skills higher.     In second grade, among ENL students, only 1 student scored high in the modality of reading and no students scored high in the  writing modality, so Tier 1 instruction planned by the students' home room and ENL teachers will be focused on.    Among ENL students currently in grade 3, a greater number of students scored high in the writing modality than reading, so  emphasis will be placed on practicing reading strategies. No students scored in the low range for the reading modality and only  1 student scored in the low range for the writing modality, so focus can remain on Tier 1 instruction, with small group work  focused helping address students' needs on particular skills.    27 % of students in grade 4 that are currently ENL students scored high in the writing modality. 8% scored in the low range. No  students scored in the high range of the reading modality and only 1 student scored in the low range. Tier 1 instruction to  boost reading strategies will be emphasized while the student scoring in the low range will be monitored with 1 on 1  conference work by both the ENL and classroom teacher to push for improvement.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Classroom teachers group students for focused skill instruction during reading and writing lessons. At these times, the ENL  teacher supports instruction by working with English learners on skills based on their performance on baseline  and midline writing assessments, Fountas and Pinnel reading achievement, and the Periodic Assessment. Students are also  invited to after-school and Saturday school programs held for ENL students concentrating on the areas they need  improvement in.  Current ENL Students in  second grade are in need of intervention based reading assessments and will be  targeted to receive help during after school programs to improve comprehension skills. Current ENL students in grades 4 and 5  will be invited to attend after school intervention lessons to improve reading comprehension and inference skills.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status        Results of formal and informal assessments are looked at periodically by the ENL teachers in tandem with teachers on each  grade level and administrators. These assessments include the previous year's NYSESLAT Exam, NY State ELA and Mathematics  exams where applicable, baseline, midline, and end line writing assessments, and Fountas and Pinnel running records  throughout the school year, however teacher observations of student behaviors and samples of student work are also  considered. Student progress is measured to identify areas of need that are then addressed within the RTI Three-tiered  system. The first component of this is to develop a strong Tier 1 level of instruction, which is aimed at the broadest range of  students. This is developed by the collaboration of ENL teachers with classroom teachers to incorporate language objectives  into lesson plans,and develop strategies to include meaningful exposure to literacy materials throughout lessons that will  positively impact English language learners. One ENL teacher works with teams of teachers in grades K - 2, and another ENL  teacher works with teachers in grades 3 - 5. After school professional development conducted on Mondays from 2:20 to 3:40  also give opportunities for the ENL teachers to work together with coaches and teacher teams to develop strong lessons that  help ENL students develop literacy skills.    Tier 2 instruction is aimed at students falling slightly behind in the achievement of grade level standards. This is addressed with  small group instruction. The areas of need among ENL students at the Entering and Emerging levels are identified by looking at  performance on assessments, and then focused upon when the ENL teachers work with these students in Stand Alone  instruction periods. The ENL teachers also coordinate with classroom teachers to work with small groups of students to target  specific reading and writing skills that need development. Tier 3 students are those identified as being At Risk. Times are  planned for the ENL teacher or  reading intervention specialist to work with such students one on one during independent  work time in the student's classroom and assist them in areas where they are falling behind. Meetings are also held among the  ENL teachers to identify other factors that may impeded students' development, such as lack of literacy experiences in the  native country. Strategies are then developed to increase these students' opportunities to practice, and disseminated to the  classroom teachers. Tier 3 instruction is also planned.              6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   NYSESLAT assessment data, New York State ELA and Math Assessment data are used to evaluate and direct the focus of ELL  programs in the school, which are reviewed using the ELL Data Analysis too. These results are looked at in late August by the  ENL teacher and principals, and reviewed again among the ENL teacher and classroom teachers who service ENL students.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74        On the 2017 NY State Math Exam 57% of the students currently enrolled as ENL Students in grade 4 scored at a level 1. These  students will be targeted to receive additional help during an afterschool program to reinforce their math calculation skills  with both English and, where suitable to the child, native language supports in place, once a week. 29% scored at a Level 2.  These students will be met with as a small group during their class' math instruction time by the ENL teacher to push their  problem solving skills to increase their potential to score at a Level 3 or higher.     On the 2017 NY State Math Exam 66% of students currently enrolled as ENL students in Grade 5 scored at a Level 1.  These  students will be targeted to receive additional help during an afterschool program to reinforce their math comprehension and  problem solving skills once a week. As this group consists of 4 students, they will also be met with during their main class'  instructional time by an ENL teacher to support their ability to comprehend in both English and, when suitable to the child, in  their home language.    On the 2017 New York State ELA Exam, 64% of students who are currently enrolled in ENL in grade 4 who were eligible to take  the exam scored at a level 1 and 36% of fourth  graders who took the exam scored at a level 2.  These students will be invited to an afterschool program to boost reading strategies and skills.    On the 2017 New York ELA Exam, 3 of the 3 students who are currently enrolled in ENL in Grade 5 and were eligible to take the  exam scored at Level 1. One of these students is at the Transitioning level, and showed a growth percentile of 62%. During  Integrated ENL periods, emphasis will be placed on building his reading level and comprehension strategies. The other two  students will in Tier 2 RTI groups to raise reading strategy work and comprehension.                  7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The EDAT is used to generate reports that show how ENL students at each grade level performed on the most recent  NYSESLAT, NY State ELA and Mathematics exams. Reports are printed and shared with teachers at each grade level working  with these ENL students, and discussed during planning sessions.      Data sheets documenting student performance on  assessments are completed by teachers and shared among students' service providers. Grouping of students for RTI and ENL  services are recorded on forms, which are provided to the the students' classroom teachers and other service providers. Email  communications among teachers are also carried out so that necessary adjustments to programs can be made, and shown to  all teachers responsible for a given student so that necessary instructional services can be planned for.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.          Students identified as English language learners are placed in monolingual English speaking classes. These students receive  the required periods of English as a Second Language from a certified ENL teacher. We utilize both Standalone and Integrated  models with students receiving instruction in both pullout and push in settings. Students are placed as per their grade and age  appropriate level. Their English proficiency ranges between 5 levels: entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding, and  commanding. Therefore differentiated small group instruction is provided in order to better accommodate their language and  academic needs, and students receive instruction in both a standalone and integrated model. It is ensured that entering and  emerging students receive a balance of standalone instruction to focus on language acquisition, and integrated instruction  carried out in collaboration between the students' homeroom and ENL teacher, focused on grade level content (math, science,  social studies, writing, and language arts).  Transitioning students receive both standalone and integrated instruction, while  expanding and commanding students only receive instruction in the integrated model. Students in grades K -2  will receive   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75      instruction from the ENL teacher, Mr. Cotton, while students in grades 3 - 5 will receive instruction from the ENL teacher Mr.  Mackler. Students at the entering and emerging levels receive 360 minutes of support. For 180 minutes, the instruction is in a  standalone model. For the other 180 minutes, the instruction is integrated, with both the homeroom teacher and ENL teacher  collaborating to instruct the students in content areas (math, science, social studies, writing) in their homeroom setting  together with their classmates.   Transitioning students receive at least 180 minutes of instruction from one of their ENL  teachers in an integrated model, while receiving 90 additional minutes of instruction in a standalone setting. Students at the  expanding level receive 180 minutes of instruction in the integrated model. Commanding students who have received a score  of proficient on the NYSESLAT exam in the 2 previous years, or who have received a score of 3 or higher on the previous two  years' ELA exam, receive 90 minutes of integrated instruction. (Mr. Cotton and Mr. Mackler co-teach with homeroom teachers  to provide service to students at the expanding or proficient levels. Integrated instruction is provided to students who have  tested out of ENL within the past 2 years. These lessons take place during students' usual English language arts or mathematics  blocks.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      N/A      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.             We make sure that the mandated instructional minutes are provided according to the proficiency levels.  The ENL  teachers are aware of the New York State mandated minutes of instruction for their ELLs. PS 110 is in compliance in regards to  our programming and scheduling based upon these state mandates. ENL students identified as either Entering (EN) or  Emerging (EM) receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week, with 180 of those minutes being in the standalone model and  180 minutes in the integrated model. ENL students identified as Transitioning receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction, with at  least 90 of those minutes being in an integrated model. Depending on the students' academic performance in the given  content being taught, the remaining 90 minutes of instruction for transitioning students is either in a standalone or integrated  model.  Expanding (EX) students receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week, all in the integrated model. Students who  have achieved a status of Commanding within the previous two years, either by earning a score of 'proficient' on the NYSESLAT  exam or a score of 3 or higher on the NYS ELA exam, will be provided with 90 minutes of ENL instruction per week in the  integrated model.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.     Our ENL teachers use instructional practices that make content accessible and comprehensible for English Language Learners  using SIOP practices inclusive of building background, relating the material to the students cultural understanding, using  language accessible to the students and emphasizing key vocabulary through a variety of activities.  Additionally, the content  area teachers provide multiple opportunities for discussion and comprehension development based on hands-on activities and  projects conducted in class.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?     The Spanish LAB is administered to identified English language learners whose home language is Spanish. Students are  screened as per CR 154, Part 117 for giftedness or learning disability as well as per their language deficiencies. Materials are  translated by the NYCDOE Translation Unit, when possible, and independent translation service providers in the case of low  incidence languages, to provide content assessments to ELLs when necessary.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    a. At PS 110, we work with SIFE students, if any, making sure that we build a supportive environment that responds to the  immediate social, cultural, and linguistic needs of such students. We work on activating students' prior knowledge to stimulate  student motivation, and determine where to start instruction as well as lay out the next steps. Some other strategies include:  word associations, KWL charts, and anticipation guides. A print rich environment, appropriate lower-grade texts or texts that   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76      are written for a lower reading level, high interest, low abililty books, and bilingual glossaries are provided to support such  students' learning. Additional small group instruction strategies used include: Total Physical Response, modeling, bridging,  contextualization, and text representation. Goals are set by the ENL and classroom teacher based on initial assessments to  make gains in basic literacy and mathematics skills.  b. Instruction for students who have been in the program less than three years is presented using several modalities in order  to address different proficiency level and different learning styles as well. Newcomers are paired with a highly proficient ESL  student as learning buddy. The ELL student buddy helps the newcomer adjust to the cultural aspects of the school and  expectations within each class. He acts as a mentor and tutor to the newcomer. Vocabulary development, visuals, repetition,  and other scaffolding strategies are used to differentiate instruction and to move students from Basic Interpersonal  Communication Skills (BICS) to Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP).   c./d. Students who have received ESL services for 4 to 6 years or have completed six years are eligible to receive Academic  Intervention Services. This is provided for long-term ELLs, ELLs with special needs, and ELLs who need transitional support in  academic areas. Students who exhibit inadequate growth on reading assessments receive additional minutes per day in  literacy instruction using a reading intervention program focused on helping them achieve grade-level proficiency in each  essential reading component like phonemic awareness, comprehension, etc. They are placed in flexible groups that change  according to need and progress. Students are also provided with additional instructional time during after school. Problem  solving is another way we use to support them as we implement Response to Intervention (RTI) model. Pair and group work is  planned for long term ELLs to ease their frustration and further support their understanding. Sharing in small groups develops  their listening and speaking skills as they gain confidence and prepare to share in a larger group. Pre-writing activities and  thinking aloud while modeling for students is crucial to understanding and preparing ELLs for different tasks as we gradually  increase the level of difficulty and higher order thinking skills.   e. Former ELLs are supported using differentiated instruction, and small groups. Using multiple sources for information gives  former ELLs a chance to access information using different modalities. They continue to build their academic langauge through  emphasis on learning vocabulary in context. They are also entitled to use dictionaries for word-for-word translations on state  exams for the first two years after they score proficient. 90 minutes of instruction is also provided to these students by the ENL  teachers in the school, in collaboration with the students' homeroom teacher.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The students' homeroom teacher, ENL teacher, content area teachers, and additional support teachers (speech, SETS) use a  varieties of strategies to support the student's achievement in academic content area as well as English language  development, including developing materials with multiple access points (visual, kinesthetic, etc). This includes online  presentation tools such as Brainpop and Go Noodle, which present information with images and auditory support. Students  are also signed up to individualized learning support programs in literacy and math, RAZ-kids, iReady, and Big Brains. These  programs tailor math and reading activities to the students' ability level. Options in RAZ-kids allow students to access texts  visually and with read-aloud support. Students are also grouped collaboratively to benefit from the support of their classmates  when appropriate, or seated in such a way that they can pay closer attention and not suffer distractions, according to  specifications on their IEPs. All classes are equipped with leveled libraries so that students can read independently and in small  groups at their own ability levels, while practicing in guided groups to achieve the next level.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Meetings are held regularly once a month, during which the student's homeroom teacher, ENL teacher, and all support  teachers, as well as the Assistant Principals, Ms. Gjongecaj, the ENL Director, and Ms. Otero, the Special Education Director to  discuss the progress of ENL students with IEPs. In the case of students not making sufficient progress, scheduling is adjusted so  that the students receive IEP support in the content areas where the student lacks progress. Students making sufficient  progress in certain areas are moved to another classroom on the same grade level when they are working on this content so  that they can learn in the least restrictive environment possible.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Using data to improve instruction, our students are also provided with additional instructional support in Math and content  areas. Progress check and unit test results are analyzed and adjustments are made to address students' weaknesses. Social  Studies, Science, and Math bilingual glossaries are provided to ELLs to support them with content terminology and/or   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77         cognates. Students are also given additional instructional time after school. In order to better help them meet their needs, the  after school program runs two times a week for two hours. Specific attention will be paid to expanding their vocabulary,  language development, and writing. Students will read, write, listen, and speak with the purpose of enhancing their academic  language needed for success. Informal assessments will be constantly used to reassess students' growth to adjust their  progress made and determine further instructional goals.   Academic Intervention Services and Response to Intervention (RTI) are provided for newcomers, long-term ELLs, ELLs with  special needs, and ELLs who exhibit inadequate growth on reading assessments etc. Such support is given either individually or  in small flexible groups that change according to need and progress. All the above mentioned programs focus on specific  standards and benchmark assessment data. Additional support is provided in student's home language if applicable (such as  Spanish language).      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Expeditionary Learning is the new program that will be used for literacy and mathematics. Professional  development sessions will be offered and study groups will be formed to discuss ways of scaffolding and  differentiating instruction. WITSI methodology will be considered for providing rigorous and  focused writing instruction.      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  No Bilingual program has been established in the school.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All ELL students are afforded equal access to all school programs. They are invited to attend the after school programs that are  being offered and a Saturday Academy.  They are welcomed to participate in after school music and band programs and clubs.  Title III funds are used to supplement services for our ELL population. Students are given additional support on reading,  writing, and math with the goal of accelerating their learning outcomes. Afterschool programs will include ENL classes for  students in grades 2 - 5 on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:30 - 4:30, and will run from the last week of October until the  first week in May. The Saturday program begins in the second week of December and runs through the 2nd week in March,               Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78            Instructional materials and technology are used to support the ELL program. SMART Boards have been installed in all  classrooms. Document cameras are also used to support ENL and small group instruction. Instructional videos and visuals are  used when appropriate to enhance instruction and give students another mode of access to the lesson. In order to further  develop reading skills and math fluency, students have access to XXX, Raz_Kids and BigBrainz.  "New York Ready" is used as a  supplement for the after school program. Bilingual glossaries are provided to students to enhance understanding of subject  matter in Math, Science, and Social Studies.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Native language support, when necessary is provided by the ENL teachers, bilingual teachers and/or paraprofessionals. Verbal  interpretation is provided as well as teaching and using cognates, glossaries, and dictionaries. Activities during the Hispanic  Heritage month are scheduled and parents are invited as well.        Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    All required services and supports are grade and age level appropriate. The ENL teachers articulate and plan with classroom  teachers and they the units of study to the students' needs. Vocabulary and language development as well as scaffolding strategies  are used to support student learning. The curriculum used by classroom teachers in grades 3- 5 is derived from NY Engage  for  literacy and mathematics. They are fully aligned to New York State Common Core Learning Standards. Materials used to scaffold for  ENL students are taken from the materials available on the NY Engage website, and geared toward each student's grade level, and  are aimed at helping students achieve the same learning objectives as students on the grade are working toward in each unit.                           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80              Part VI: LAP Assurances   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81      School Name:   Newly enrolled ELL students are invited to visit the school before the beginning of the year with the purpose of  assisting them in the transition process. They attend an orientation scheduled for the second week of school along with other  parents of new students, which has presenters and materials to make communication in new parents' home language possible.  New ENL students and their parents/guardians are introduced to Ms. Chevere, the parent coordinator, and made aware of her  schedule and contact information should assistance be sought. The parent coordination also answers questions via phone and  provides assistance in person to new ENL students and parents during the summer. The ENL teacher assists in registration the  week before school begins, and offers parents assistance with registration procedure, as well as answering questions about their  child's academic needs and routines. School counselors are made aware by classroom teachers and the ENL teacher of students  with  difficulty  adjusting  to  changes  in  environment,  and  schedules  time  to  work  with  them  during  the  school  day,  as  well  as  reaching out to parents to offer assistance.  Tuesday afternoons, from 2:30 - 3:30, after students are dismissed, parents of new  ENL students and their children are invited to the ENL room (room 123) to ask the ENL teachers questions, or access books in  English  Spanish.

Guidance  counselors and the  mainstream teachers learn  about the ELLs' language  and academic  backgrounds, as well as  their emotional needs and  cultural behaviors in order  to build a relationship of  trust with students and to  outreach parental support  which is crucial to the  students' success in  school.     Workshops are offered  throughout the school  year for teachers engaged  in the instruction of ELLs.  They cover various topics  and offer strategies for  scaffolding and facilitating  language acquisition in  order to better engage in  the Common Core  curriculum, and help to  increase familiarity with  the NYSESLAT assessment  format that students will  need to achieve on. The  ENL teachers attend  several professional  development workshops  throughout the year and  work with other teachers  of ELLs in turn-key  sessions.     A Calendar of Professional  Development is  established and  distributed at the  beginning of each month  outlining professional  development topics that  will be covered during  Monday afternoon  sessions dedicated to  Professional Development,  along with the name of  the facilitator of each.  Teachers of ELL students,  including the ENL teachers  in the school, will attend  these professional  development periods  weekly.

This  occurs during time devoted  to professional development  Monday afternoons from  2:30 - 3:40. During  designated sessions, the  school's ENL teachers will  facilitate professional  development presentations  for teachers of ELL students  on creating effective  language objectives,  scaffolding lessons  for ELL's of varying  proficiency levels, and  incorporating ENL teaching  strategies into math lessons.  1 Teacher of ENL at the  school will participate in  monthly Liaisons' Meetings  and communicate  information and strategies  from them to the other ENL  teacher, as well as other  teachers of ENL students  during some of these  Monday professional  development periods, as  well as during professional  periods throughout the  week. For each of the  sessions described above,  an agenda is formed and   Assistant Principal      attend grade level  meetings with teachers on  each of the grades they  work with, to practice the  protocol of reviewing and  evaluating the work of  both ELL and non-ELL  students. This work is  checked against the New  York State Common Core  Standards. Strategies to  help students achieve  these standards are  shared among the  teachers themselves,a nd  introduced by the school's  literacy and math coaches.  The ENL teachers also  provide ENL-strategies  that may help other  teachers of ELL students  address the needs of their  students.   Meetings are scheduled  with the parents of ENL  students every Tuesday  afternoons during the  block of time dedicated to  parent engagement after  students have been  dismissed, from 2:30 -  3:30. During these  meetings, student work  and assessment results are  reviewed, current  instructional supports are  detailed, and goals are set  for improvement. One ENL  teacher meets with  parents of students in  grades K-2 and the other  ENL teacher meets with  parents of students in  grades 3 - 5. These  meetings are scheduled to  begin the first week of  November. From the  beginning of the school  year until that point, the  ENL teachers, in  communication with the  students' classroom  teachers uses both formal  and informal assessments  to determine the priority  of students whose parents  should be met with at the  earliest point in the  schedule.

It  is then distributed to  teachers at each session,  with a copy being added to  an ENL Binder stored in the  ENL classrrom. An  attendance list for each  activity is also circulated and  then stored in the same  binder.     Parents of ELLs are offered a  series of workshops  throughout the school year.  Mr. Mackler provide  workshops  to help parents  with strategies to support  their children such as  enhancing vocabulary, using  manipulatives to learn math,  as well as reading and  writing strategies. Parents  are also gathered for Arts  and Crafts activities  throughout the year.  Celebrations for Mother's  Day, Father's Day, etc. are a  tradition in our school and  parents of ELLs love to  attend.     We value parent  involvement as an  important factor to achieve  our goals as educators. We  have ongoing contacts with  parents of LEP students  three times a year  (September, November, and  April). In addition, we have  planned to provide the  following:   -Develop a Family Literacy  program for parents - During   Parent Coordinator      the highest factors are  given the greatest priority.  Then parents, are notified  by letters sent home the  week prior in the language  indicated as the preferred  language on the HLIS.  Parents are then asked to  confirm their availability  or to ask for the meeting  to be rescheduled.  Arrangements are made  for translators to be  available to assist in the  conference when needed.  Attendance is taken and  kept in the ENL binder, as  well as notes that give an  overview of the student's  progress and goals as  formulated by the  student's parents and ENL  teacher.          Attention is being focused  on  increasing communication  between the classroom  teachers and ENL teacher,  to make the  implementation of  strategies to support  ELLs more seamless. With  a classroom teacher  certified in TESOL, it will  become easier to provide  professional development  among the various service  providers and classroom  teachers in the school and  reflect communally on  how they are being carried  out, so that improvements  in instruction can be  continually strived for.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          85      the course of 4 months,  parents will learn basic  computer skills (once a  week).     -Offer adult ESL classes-  Parents and family  of ELLs and  former ELLs attend class  once a week to improve  their own English skills in  listening, speaking, reading,  and writing.     We also provide our ELLs'  and former ELLs' parents  with translation services and  interpretation services.  Translation devices have  been purchased in our  school to support the  translation of all our non- native speaker parents. We  will ensure that all  documents needing  translation to parents are  translated into Spanish.  Written translation and oral  interpretation services will  be provided to families  needing these services in a  language other than Spanish  by parent volunteers who  write and speak the same  language. In addition,  several workshops are  provided throughout the  school year to provide  ongoing learning  opportunities for parents  and families. Such  workshops  include ESL Workshops,  Parent Curriculum Meeting,  Common Core Learning  Standards (CCLS) and  expectations for our  students, Family Literacy,  Mathematics Workshops,  and field trips. Parents are  also provided with  workshops on how to  support their children on  preparing for the state  tests.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.         32% of our parent community has expressed the preference of a language other than English, both written and  oral. 12 languages other than English have been expressed as a preference among our parent population. Among  these, Spanish is the majority with 26.6% of our parents expressing this preference for written communication,  and 27.05% percent expressing this preference for oral communication. This information is gathered by having  parents complete a Home Language Identification Survey at the time of enrollment. At the same time, interviews  are conducted with the parent by a pedagogue trained in TESOL. This information is entered into ATS along with  biographical information about the students being enrolled. The preferred home language for both written and  oral communication is also asked for when students complete Student Emergency Contact Cards. Surveys are also  administered each year by the Parent Coordinator, with information then disseminated to administration, staff,  and teachers so that they can prepare for the distribution of materials in the parents' preferred home language,  and so we can prepare necessary translation services in advance of conferences.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          88              2.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      Parents are asked to provide contacts, for instance family members, who can speak English and be contacted in the  case of a school emergency that needs to be reported to them. These relations are contacted if it is a parent whose  preferred language is one other than English or Spanish. It is also ensured that a member of the office staff who is  bilingual in English and Spanish is present at all times. On the school's list of parents to contact in case of emergency,  there is an indication of parents whose preferred language is Spanish so that the bilingual office staff contacts them.

They will present information received from training by  members of The Translation and Interpretation Unit.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Parents whose primary language is other that English are provided with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and  Responsibilities which include their rights regarding translation and interpretation services. To inform parents of  available language services a sign is posted in the main office indicating the appropriate languages available for  translation services. Posters are displayed in the lobby and outside the Parent Coordinator's office outlining the rights  parents have to translation services, and our procedures for doing so.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          93         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Surveys are distributed to parents in September and June asking them to rate their level of satisfaction with  translation services in the school, and to make recommendations for services they would like to see improved.  Parents are also asked informally by the Parent Coordinator for their satisfaction with services in place, and areas they  would like to see improvements in. The information gathered from the surveys and conversations with parents are  shared with the principal, and an action plan of steps to take toward improving the level of inclusion of all parents are  put into place.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          94
