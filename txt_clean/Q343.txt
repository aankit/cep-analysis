This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our Mission   Section 4: CEP Overview      The Children’s Lab School embraces the learning needs of all students. We encourage every child to experience the  joy of learning and achieving. We teach our students in ways that activate their strengths, meet their particular needs,  and increase their resilience as learners. We work in a climate of respect for all children and adults in the school  community, with explicit support for social and emotional growth. Our goal is to help our students to become happy,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      confident and compassionate learners who have the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in middle school and  beyond.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    1. The Children’s Lab School opened in September 2014 and is growing one grade per year until we are a PreK - 5th  grade elementary school at full scale. We are a diverse community; 38% of our students are English Language  Learners. The predominant home language is Spanish. We serve families in our zoned neighborhoods of Sunnyside  and Woodside. In addition, we have students who came to us on an overflow basis from Corona and Elmhurst. We  offer one full-day UPK class and three classes per grade for grades K through 4th. We also have one self-contained  special education 2/3/4 bridge class. Grades K -3 each have one Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) class; 4th grade has two  ICT classes. Services for English Language Learners are offered on an ENL push-in and pull-out model.   Our Beliefs   Children learn best when provided meaningful and authentic instruction in an atmosphere of high expectations.  Children have the opportunity to explore, ask questions, and study ideas and topics in depth through interdisciplinary  units created thoughtfully using the Understanding by Design framework.   Children learn at different rates, using different strengths and different learning styles . We support learners in every  stage of development, differentiating instructing using the principles of Universal Design for Learning and supported  by current technology to help all children achieve.   Children learn when they feel good about their efforts and relationships . Our school promotes a climate of respect  and appreciation for individual and cultural diversity in all forms. We use the Responsive Classroom approach to  creating safe, challenging, and joyful classrooms.   Children learn when their parents are active participants in their school and education. We not only communicate with  parents regularly, we encourage their regular involvement in the school community and value their contributions to  the daily life of the school.   Our Values   AUTHENTIC WORK   We strive to make the best use of instructional time and resources to give all children what they need to meet their  potential. Teaching and learning are purposeful and meaningful.   RESPECT FOR DIVERSITY   All members of the school community are respected for who they are as individuals. We celebrate the many and  varied strengths, talents, and achievements of every child and adult and their cultures.   CONTINUAL LEARNING   Everyone in the school community—staff, students and families—commits to life-long learning. We respect effort and  resilience.    COMMUNITY   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Students, staff, and families feel a connection with the school as a place that is welcoming and valuable to themselves  and their community. We place the highest value on collaboration and positive communication.   Our Instructional Vision: “Ground and Sky”   We believe that every child should be well grounded in the basics in the core academic areas of reading, writing and  math. At the same time, all children deserve the opportunity to “reach for the sky” developing their imagination and  creativity through in-depth explorations in social studies, science, music and the arts.   To fulfill our vision, we have established several strategic partnerships. We work with the Northeast Foundation for  Children to implement the Responsive Classroom approach to social/emotional development This is a research- and  evidence-based program designed to foster safe, joyful and challenging classrooms. To fulfill our commitment to  authentic instruction in the arts, we have partnered with Education Through Music which provides us with a full-time  certified music teacher. We have also partnered with Studio in a School and Architecture for Kids to bring in artists-in- residence for art and architectures. We also partner with Sunnyside Community Services to provide an enriching  after-school program for our students that includes a range of sports, arts and STEM activities.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   2. As noted above, 38% of our students are English Language Learners; our entering kindergarten students have over  10 different home languages. 20% of our students have IEPs. This includes 12 students in a special education bridge  class for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grade students.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   3. As evidenced by the results of our end-of-year assessments, we have made the most growth in rigorous instruction  and effective school leadership. In addition, we have demonstrated growth in supportive environment and teacher  collaboration as evidenced by our selection as a Showcase School for our practices in social/emotional learning and  school culture. Our key focus areas are strengthening our math and writing instruction across the grades and  supporting the needs of our ENL students.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 24Q343   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   368   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     In our 2017-18 S/CEP, we set a goal of 45% of our 3rd grade students scoring "proficient" or "advanced" on the NY  State Common Core assessment. While we have not yet received our results, 52% of our 3rd grade students had  reading levels at or above grade levels as assessed by Fountas & Pinnell Benchmark Reading Assessment (F&P).    1. Our strengths in this element include highly qualified, highly trained teachers, implementation of two research- based phonics programs (Wilson Fundations for K and 1st grade, Fountas and Pinnell for 2nd grade and above), and a  teacher-designed balanced literacy curriculum aligned to the Common Core standards and planned using the  Understanding by Design methodology. All students receive targeted reading instruction in small groups ("guided  reading") during literacy class time. In 2017-18, we supplemented this work with additional small group instruction  after school as part of our Academic Intervention Services (AIS) plan. As noted in the Supportive Environment element  below, we exceeded our goal of having 60% of students receiving AIS make at least one year's growth in reading.   2. Our needs include a better understanding of the demands of the NYS ELA test. We need to ensure that our  instruction aligns with the NYS Common Core standards and the newly-released Next Generation State Standards so  that students can meet or exceed those standards.   Our goal for this draft of the S/CEP is that 45% of our 3rd and 4th graders will score proficient or advanced on the  standardized state exams for ELA. We plan to review this goal once we have received the test scores for 2017-18 so  that we can ensure that our goal is both ambitious and attainable.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, 55% of 3rd grade and 4th grade students will score proficient or advanced on the ELA NY State Common  Core exam.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   Teachers will implement the evidence-based phonics program  daily. Teachers will receive professional development in their  grade-level phonics program and will be observed to ensure the  program is delivered with fidelity.   Teachers will implement balanced literacy reading and writing  units of study, aligned to the Common Core, adapting them to  the needs of our students using the Understanding by Design  protocol.   Teachers will implement guided reading instruction in small  homogeneous groups in order to target critical reading skills for  all students. Groups of students with greater needs will meet  more frequently.    Teachers will identify students who are below grade level and/or  whose progress in reading has stalled. These students will  receive additional targeted literacy instruction before or after  school for eight weeks at a time. Students will be re-evaluated at  the end of each cycle to determine placement in the next cycle  of AIS.   Teachers will provide additional instruction specifically designed  to target the demands of standardized tests during a  supplemental Saturday Academy.   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

In terms of school culture, we have demonstrated that we have established a highly supportive environment as  evidenced by our 2016-17 school survey. 95% of parents say that this school offers a wide enough variety of courses,  extracurricular activities, and services to keep their child interested in school (City: 91%); 99% of parents say that they  are satisfied with the education their child received this year (City: 97%); 95% of teachers say that they would  recommend their school to parents seeking a place for their child (City: 91%); and 97% of parents say that school staff  work hard to build trusting relationships with them (City: 96%).   2. To deepen our support for our English Language Learners (ELLs), we intend to revise our Title III program. We  believe we can do more for these students and their families. We will closely analyze the results of the Spring 2018  NYSESLAT to identify the key areas in need of improvement. We will revise our Title III after-school program to  increase student interest and engagement. Our results from the 2016-17 NYSESLAT show that 41% of our ELLs moved  up at least 1 level in English language development. We have set a preliminary goal of 50% of our ELLs moving up at  least one level. We will revisit this goal when we receive our 2017-18 NYSESLAT results.   3. Our policies, practices, and structures that support the whole child are embedded in our school-wide  implementation of Responsive Classroom. One way we will sustain this level this year is by continuing in the citywide  Showcase initiative as a Showcase School featuring our work with Responsive Classroom as our social-emotional  framework.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   1. Our strengths continue to be the commitment and professionalism our teachers bring to the work of teaching and  learning. In the 2016-17 NYC School Survey, 100% of our teachers agreed or strongly agreed that "all teachers feel  responsible that all students learn," "teachers design instructional programs together," and "the principal, teachers,  and staff collaborate to make this school run effectively."    2. Because the school continues to grow one grade per year, teachers have focused their attention mostly on the  work of their own grade. Now that we are moving into our fifth year, we have the opportunity to increase the quality  and amount of time spent in professional development and planning across grades. Our focus this year continues to  be improving the quality of our writing instruction. This year, we came very close to meeting our goal of 70% of  students performing at or above grade level on an end-of-year writing assessment (68%); however, there were  significant differences among grades: kindergarten (79%), 1st grade (83%), 2nd grade (56%), 3rd grade (54%). It is  evident that as the demands of writing increase, our students need more support to develop grade-appropriate  writing skills. Through vertical planning across grades, we will study and plan effective methods for teaching writing,  with a particular focus on sentence structure. Students who need additional support in this area will be served by our  AIS supplemental instruction program (before and after school small group tutoring).

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   1. According to the End of Year NYC Performance Tasks in Math, our students achieved the following:     53.8% of first grade students tested proficient (53.5% district average) [includes both 1st and 2nd grade   standards]     83.1% of second grade students tested proficient (42.5% district average),    37.5% of third grade students tested proficient (39% district average)   Our sub-scores indicate that our students demonstrate stronger proficiency in number sense than they do in  operations and algebraic thinking. This aligns with the work we have done around conceptual understanding of  number, supported by our coach from Math in the City. Further, the achievement levels of our younger students,  especially in second grade, indicate that our students are ready for more challenging work earlier on. This, in turn,  should raise the achievement levels of our students in 3rd and 4th grades.   2. Our June Math Instructional Report (showing school-wide raw scores on the state exam) indicates that students  performed below the city average on multiple standards, especially those involving fractions. Based on these results,  we are going to revise our units of study across grades K-4 so that students can acquire the skills and understandings  necessary to meet all NYS Common Core and Next Generation standards. In particular, we plan to move some units of  study involving early multiplication concepts and skills to 2nd grade so that there is more time in 3rd grade to work on  division and fractions.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  At the Children’s Lab School, we attract and retain highly qualified teachers by reinforcing our school’s mission and  goals:   Teachers hired are certified and licensed in their subject area.   Almost all teachers hired have dual and/or triple certification.   A hiring committee is organized to conduct interviews, assess portfolios and observe demonstration lessons in order  to attract highly-qualified teachers.   Members of our SLT and PD Committee meet regularly to review, reflect, and revise school-based goals and  instructional focuses.   All teachers engage in at least two cycles of inquiry work throughout the year to improve best practices and ensure  staff is highly qualified. Selected teachers, based on individual and school needs, attend three-day workshops offered  by the Field Support Center. All new teachers are assigned DOE mentors that meet with them at least twice weekly to  provide coaching and support.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   High quality professional development opportunities are provided throughout the year for all faculty.   Teachers attend professional development workshops outside of the school and share this information with their  colleagues during scheduled sessions.   The PD Committee identifies areas of teacher need and interests and plans professional development activities to  meet these areas of need and interest.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32      Experienced, tenured teachers mentor all new teachers.   Grade teams are encouraged through collaboration to examine and revised our current curriculum based on student  work analysis.   A one-week August Institute of professional development provides support for both new and returning teachers.        Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  Prek children enrolled here at Children’s Lab School engage in a month-long transition-to-kindergarten curriculum.  PreK parents attend transition-to-kindergarten workshops led by classroom teachers and the early childhood social  worker. PreK teachers participate in curriculum vertical alignment PD with the kindergarten teachers. Our PreK  teachers share information from our authentic assessment system, Teaching Strategies Gold, with our kindergarten  teachers. We hold Open House information sessions for parents of all PreK children – students from Children’s Lab  School and other UPK programs in the community.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Our MOSL teacher committee selects assessments to be used as both beginning- and end-of-year benchmark  assessments. Our grade teams select assessments aligned with the Common Core and the content areas. They also  write rubrics for curriculum-embedded performance tasks. They design and plan the assessment calendar so that  meaningful sets of data are available for analysis at appropriate intervals. They hold multiple norming sessions  throughout the year to review student work and create shared understandings of rubrics and other assessments.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33     4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34        A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The Children’s Lab School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A  of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      The Children’s Lab School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.       For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and  Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

We believe that connecting the  targeted language work with the social studies and science units of study the children are  learning during the day will be more effective. All of the activities described below will take  place during the after-school program (not during the school day). Learning targets will be  updated in September 2018 after the release of 2018 NYSESLAT scores.  In fourth grade, we will use our ELA unit on biographies to provide a basis for writing both  fiction and non-fiction pieces.  In third grade, we will use the social studies curriculum of world cultures as a basis to explore  oral and written storytelling and folktales. This will give us additional opportunities to connect  students' home cultures to their studies in school.   In second grade, we will engage them in a study of NYC cultures and neighborhoods. For  example, after listening to a presentation from one of our local cultural groups, students will  interview the presenter and prepare both oral and written reports of what they learned.  In first grade, we will tap into their studies of weather, food (farm to table unit), homes and  animal habitats. Using these topics, they will produce short “news” reports for our own “TV  station – WCLS.” Teachers will use iPads to videotape children’s presentations so that they can  review and revise their written scripts and oral performances.  There will be one group of approximately 20 students in each of the four grades. One ESL- certified and one general education teacher will co-teach each group. Using the grade- appropriate Universal English Language Development rubrics for speaking and writing, the ESL- certified teachers will take the lead on planning the language goals for each lesson while the  general education teacher will take the lead on planning the science and/or social studies content.  In each class, both teachers will work jointly with all students. Each ENL/gen ed teacher pair  will work with two grades.  In addition, students will also be taught how to meet the specific demands of the written and  spoken sections of the NYSESLAT. Class assignments will be structured to align with  NYSESLAT tasks. Students will also be given opportunities to practice using materials  specifically designed for the NYSESLAT.   In addition, students in Grades 3 and 4 will attend a Saturday Academy in February and March to  prepare for the demands of the NYS ELA exam.  The principal will supervise the Title III after-school program and Saturday Academy. Teachers  will take and track attendance at each class. All program notifications will be sent home in the  parents' preferred languages as indicated on the RAPL report.   Subgroups and grade levels of students to be served:  Transitioning and Expanding ELLs in Grades 1-4  Schedule and duration:  The after-school program will meet on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:45pm to 3:45pm,  beginning on November 7th and running through May, 2019 for grades three and four.

Both the Common Core standards and the  Universal English Language Development rubrics will be analyzed to identify key benchmarks.  Teachers will receive training in multiple strategies, including Accountable Talk and building  Academic Vocabulary. The principal, who has extensive experience as an instructional coach,  will facilitate the professional development sessions, including turnkeying information from  relevant workshops. We expect that this professional development will positively impact student  learning because it is aligned to the needs of our students and because it is embedded within our  other professional development, thus forming a coherent experience for our teachers.  Teachers to receive training:  All classroom teachers  in grades 1-4 and our push-in/pull-out ENL teachers will participate in  the professional development.  Schedule and duration:  Some of this work will be done during our regularly-scheduled after school PD time.

With this in mind, families  of our ELLs and immigrant families participating in the afterschool program will be invited to  celebrations of learning where the students in the afterschool program will showcase their work.   In addition, the parent coordinator has surveyed families regarding workshops that they would  like to attend. Based on the survey results, parents will be invited to the following workshops  where they will receive information and or strategies to assist their children at home in the  following areas:   * "Know Your Rights" workshop for immigrant families (December 2018)  *  What parents need to know about state tests (October 2018)  *  Fitness   and Safety   Workshop (November 2018)  *  Family workshop on making music together (February 2019)  *  Science and Art design workshop (January 2019)  *  Transitioning to the Next Grade (May, 2019)  *  NYSESLAT parent workshop grades K, 1, 2, 3, 4 (March 2019)  * Introductory computer classes for parents (Spring 2019)  The facilitators of the above parent workshops will include the parent coordinator, the ELL  coordinator, ENL Teachers, the bilingual speech teachers, classroom teachers, the school  bilingual social worker, and our CBO Sunnyside Community Services  In addition, our CBO partner, Sunnyside Community Services, is providing a free ESOL for  Adults class that meets Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 2:30pm to 5:30pm.  Families will receive written invitations to these events in a timely manner so that they can plan  to attend.  In addition families will receive written correspondence and communication in the  parents' preferred language.  We also offer interpretation at all family events.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  P.S. 343 uses a variety of assessment tools to assess ELLs’ early literacy skills.  Foundational Assessments (TCRWP) evaluate  concepts of print, alphabet letter/sound recognition and high frequency word assessments. In addition ELA/Math Pre/Post  MOSL Assessment Tasks, NYSITELL, Spanish LAB-R,  NYSESLAT and school created checklists are used to assess the early  literacy skills of ELLs. To monitor progress in early reading skills, the Fountas and Pinnell running record assessments are used  to identify student independent and instructional reading levels and monitor progress. These assessment tools are used to  provide insights to help inform the school’s instructional plan.  In addition, teachers use various forms of informal assessments  such as conferencing notes, clasroom assessments, and anecdotal records to track student achievement.  The data collected  also helps inform instructional decisions for grouping all students including the ELLs according to their needs with emphasis on  the four language modalities.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         The data that was collected from these above-mentioned assessment tools show that the majority of ELLs tend to meet  benchmark in letter/sound and sight word recognition in Kindergarten by June as evidenced by the (TCRWP) Foundational  Assessments. The data also shows that 31% of our ELLs in Kindergarten met benchmark (Level D) in reading as evidenced by  the Fountas and Pinnell Reading level benchmark in June. However there is a portion of ELL students that did not meet the  literacy benchmark in June.  These ELL students need more time to continue to develop their foundational literacy skills,  vocabulary and oral language skills.  Through the utilization of the resources mentioned below, the ELLs will make academic  gains in all content areas.      This information has informed our school’s instructional plan as follows:     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The school structures we have in place to support this effort are:     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The programs at P.S. 343Q are evaluated using the results of the NYSESLAT test and all other formal and informal assessments  of the ELL students. This includes Fountas and Pinnell, Wilson Unit tests, Math Unit tests, ELA and Math performance task  assessments.  Teacher observation, grade level inquiry teams and discussion are also used.  ENL teachers conduct conferencing  on a regular basis with the students and monitor their progress using a checklist of indicators based on the stages of language  acquisition. ENL teachers work closely with the classroom teachers to periodically monitor the ongoing progress of every ELL  student and develop appropriate instruction.  Based on the results of the 2017 NYSESLAT, our students' areas of need are reading and writing.  The success of the vast  majority of our ELL students in advancing to the next level and or attaining English language proficiency on the 2017 NYSESLAT  demonstrates the success and hard work of all the staff, teachers, students and parents of ELL students at P.S. 343Q.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered, teachers meet in grade level meetings, share and track on Google Drive, attend  Professional Development, and participate in teacher led inquiry cycles.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Teachers analyze F&P running records, BOY MOSL, EOY MOSL, and benchmarks throughout the year.  ELLs who are at-risk will  be serviced with Tier II and Tier III interventions.  Ms. Gurzynski, our AIS teacher, has one to one and small groups.  She uses  Great Leaps. The teachers collaborate weekly to ensure all instruction is targeted to specific goals.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Based on the NYSITELL assessment results, many of the students testing into the ENL program in Kindergarten are children of  recent arrivals to the United States and enter with little knowledge of English and no English spoken at home.  These students  make rapid progress in improving their social language in English at a quick rate.  The students in grades K and 1 tend to  acquire skills in the listening/speaking modalities at first, and then develop command/proficiency in reading/writing after  receiving at least 3-4 years of ENL instruction.  However, these students will need to continue to transfer literacy skills from L1  to English. Data patterns reveal that Expanding/Advanced level students in first grade attempt to read/write at their current  level and find vocabulary difficult, especially content area vocabulary.      According to the 2017 NYSESLAT results, 26 students advanced 1 proficiency level, 1 student advanced 2 proficiency levels, 31  students remained at the same proficiency level, and 8 students regressed 1 proficiency level.     The Instructional focus will be to develop academic and content vocabulary as well as writing skills through rich conversations  and class discussions using academic vocabulary and language as a pre-cursor to writing. Through scaffolding, teacher   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         intervention/peer interaction and exposure to comprehensible input at a level one step beyond the current competence,  students will make progress in these areas.  P.S.343 provides all students with leveled reading materials. These materials draw  upon pre-reading skills, phonemic awareness, activation of prior knowledge and content-based instruction used within the  workshop model.  We are also incorporating more discussion and questioning skills to support the Common Core Standards  and the Danielson Framework. We encourage our ELLs to do the "heavy lifting" by exposing them to higher order thinking  questions throughout the day so they may have greater exposure to this type of questioning, accountable talk and use of  language.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   In order to disseminate these findings and make adjustments to our programs, teachers meet in grade level meetings, share  and track on Google Drive, attend Professional Development, and participate in teacher led inquiry cycles.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Freestanding ENL instruction is delivered through the Stand-alone and integrated model. Integrated ENL instruction is  provided using a coteaching model between the classroom teacher and ENL teacher during reading workshop, writing  workshop, shared reading, Fundations Phonics, read alouds, or a concentration in the content areas of math, science  and social studies using ENL methodology and/or technology. In addition to the co-teaching model, the ENL teacher  provides small group targeted instruction based on student needs using the Stand-alone model. ELL students are  grouped heterogeneously with mixed English language proficiency levels in all Kindergarten, First, Second, and Third  grade classrooms. The integrated model fosters collaborative team teaching for integrated ENL instruction in a  heterogeneous group organized by grade. 180 minutes of Stand-alone ENL services is provided to ELLs at the Entering  level by a certified ENL teacher using the Stand-alone model. 90 minutes of Stand-alone ENL services is provided to  students at the Emerging level by a certified ENL teacher using the Stand-alone model. In first grade, a dual certified  teacher provides the required minutes of standalone ENL instruction to Entering and Emerging students. In third  grade, a dual certified teacher provides the required minutes of standalone ENL instruction to Entering and Emerging  students.                 b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Not applicable.      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      No applicable.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Launching in 2017-2018 school year in all grades (K through 6) as per part 154 requirements:   •   Beginner/Entering level students receive 180 minutes standalone ENL plus 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA for a total of  360 minutes.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      •   Low Intermediate/Emerging students receive 90 minutes standalone ENL, 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes  standalone or integrated ENL or any other content area.     •   Intermediate/Transitioning students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction plus 90 minutes standalone or  integrated ENL or any other content area.     •   Advanced/Expanding Students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area instruction.      •   Proficient/Commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or ENL/other content area instruction.     The requisite minutes are broken down into 8-50 minute periods, per class, per week for Entering and Emerging ELLs.  Out of  these 8-50 minute blocks, 180 minutes are Standalone ENL instruction. Transitioning and Expanding students are serviced in 4- 50 minute periods, per class, per week.  For up to 2 years after obtaining Commanding on NYSESLAT, students receive 2-50  minute periods per week.      The ENL teachers works collaboratively with classroom teachers to provides 5 periods of instruction daily including the content  areas of math, science and social studies to 3 Kindergarten classes, 4 first grade classes, 3 second grade classes, 3 third grade  classes, and 1 bridge K/1/2 self-contained special education classroom.       Our staff is organized appropriately through proper school scheduling. There is communication between the administration,  classroom teachers, prep teachers, other service providers, and ENL teachers ensuring that all programs are given their  mandated amount of time, and no conflicts are made. Generally, scheduling meetings are held at the start of each new year  where all information is collected ensuring proper scheduling for all classes. This also ensures that classroom teachers and ENL  teachers have the chance to coordinate both scheduling and instruction together. Teachers discuss scheduling to be sure that  there are no conflicts during the time that ENL services are delivered.   We assure that the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided according to proficiency levels in each program by  carefully aligning the ENL teachers' schedules with the schedules of the classroom teachers into whose classes the teachers are  working. Scheduling conflicts are avoided through collaboration with related service providers who also work with the ELL  student population (i.e. speech services, SETSS, etc.). Our program is a integrated/co-teach model aligned with New York State  Standards with a minimal amount of stand-alone instruction when necessary. Students enjoy maximum involvement in  classroom activities as well as the support they need through ENL methodologies and differentiated instruction. Scaffolding,  differentiation, and modeling are used on a regular basis. There are 3 licensed/certified teachers serving the ELL population  (two teachers for integrated services, one teacher who is a classroom teacher holding a TESOL licenses, and a bilingual teacher.         a.      Explicit ENL is delivered in the ENL program through planning, cooperation, and communication between the ENL and  classroom teachers. ENL and classroom teachers of ELL students have the same lunch period and meet at least once per week  or communicate regularly via email in order to compare data, share ideas and plan for instruction. Reading and writing  instruction is provided using the workshop model. Language development is encouraged by the classroom teacher and the ENL  teacher through this collaborative planning and instruction.  Together the teachers establish a low anxiety environment with  comprehensible input, opportunities for the ELL learner to work in cooperative groups, to interact with peers and awareness  of the stages of language acquisition.  Small groups targeting similar needs and levels, and differentiation of instruction is used  on a daily basis. Scaffolding activities encourage students to achieve greater language proficiency through modeling language,  providing high interest activities and pairing with a buddy to foster language development and risk taking.        A wide variety of assessment is used to assess development across the four modalities and to drive further instruction  within the Zone of Proximal Development through social interaction and academic content-based activities.  Assessment drives  instruction.  Informal assessments include portfolios, teacher observation, and teacher/student conferencing.  Formal  assessments include NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, as well as Performance tasks in ELA and Math. Student needs are assessed and  adjusted accordingly based on their performance. We engage our students in a wide variety of activities to support second  language development on a daily basis.  We support our students with strong visuals, demonstrations, and shared  experiences.  Our ELL students listen, speak, read and write while striving for high standards and enhancing their success.  In  short, P.S. 343 teachers target each student’s special need and work with these students on a regular basis in order to build   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      academic and language proficiency.       Instruction is developed to meet the specific needs of our ELL population. Students receive additional support through our  differentiated instruction and small, leveled groups. There are several implications for the school’s LAP and instruction.  Professional development in ESL strategies/methodologies provided to staff on a regular basis. Content-based Vocabulary  (domain specific) is emphasized in all grade levels.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Second language development is fostered by utilizing content specific materials to address the conventions of standard  English, knowledge of the English language and vocabulary acquisition, which are all a part of the NYS Common Core Language  Standards. Across the content areas, the ENL and Bilingual teachers make use of varied instructional approaches to enrich  language development.  Manipulatives and Realia are used on a regular basis.  Total Physical Response along with songs are  emphasized in the early childhood grades.  The use of technology (Promethean Boards, Elmos), audiovisual equipment, and  hands-on learning is encouraged.  ELL students engage in activities across the content areas which focus on all four modalities  of the ENL classrooms (listening, speaking, reading, and writing).  Content area instruction is delivered in ENL classrooms with  an emphasis placed on academic language, specialized vocabulary, grammar and comprehension of fiction and nonfiction  texts.          The bilingual, ENL, and classroom teachers of ELLs work with small groups of students based on their academic and  linguistic needs.  TPR, visuals, explicit modeling, manipulatives, speaking prompts, sentence frames, thinking maps, and  graphic organizers are some of the supports utilized to scaffold language development.  In addition, ELLs are encouraged to  deconstruct/reconstruct "juicy" complex sentences, word play,  utilize Tier 2 and Tier 3 words via read alouds and oral  repetition during shared reading.  The LEA (Language Experience Approach) is also utilized to match the written word and  spoken word in order to foster second language development.       ELL students are taught math, social studies and science using ENL strategies as described above to enhance their learning and  meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards. Students are taught in small strategy groups within the classroom  to foster their language development.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      The ELL coordinator administers the Spanish LAB-R during the LAB-R administration for Spanish-speaking eligible  students.  The ENL and bilingual teachers are able to determine basic literacy skills in Spanish based on student performance  on the Spanish LAB-R and share this information with classroom teachers so that they are aware of the students' native  language skills.  F&P sistema de evaluacion de la lectura is used to assess students' levels in F&P.   Multiple assessments, i.e.  student portfolios, state standardized tests (NYSITELL/ NYSESLAT), MOSL, informal assessments (running records, conference  notes) are used to drive  instruction as well as language development.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.There are no SIFE students at this time     b.   In order to meet the needs of newcomers, P.S. 343Q has taken a series of actions. ELL students who are considered to be  newcomers get differentiated instruction with a strong emphasis on methodologies to increase BICS and CALP vocabulary,  spelling, grammar, and critical thinking skills.  These students are grouped together to allow for more individualized attention   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      from both the classroom teachers and ENL teachers. In addition, students are acclimated to life in the USA during  expeditionary trips outside of the building and through developing social skills by speaking with teachers and peers. They also  have access to technology with the RAZ Kids program, LEXIA, Reading A-Z, and BrainPop.  Newcomer breakfast is offered to  new arrival students in grades K-2.  There is a focus on pragmatic themes, such as; clothing, parts of the body, greetings, food,  and social norms.  b & c               Both the classroom teacher and ENL teacher work collaboratively to incorporate as much language as possible into the  classroom environment. Vocabulary, word walls and charts are used within every lesson. Students receive explicit vocabulary  instruction through activities such as text talk.  Students work in small groups, especially during reading and writing to ensure  their areas of need are met. ENL teachers provide extra assistance using graphic organizers and specialized differentiated  worksheets to target specific skills. There is test prep given using Ready NY CCLS practice books to the upper grades by  modeling and scaffolding testing strategies, as well as the correct way t In the two months prior to state testing, all students  are involved in Test Prep Seminars which are given by our teachers within their classrooms. These seminars use visuals which  help the ELL students greatly. At times, the ELL teachers may also pull small groups out of the classroom in order to teach or  model a language skill of particular difficulty. There is also test prep practice offered within the extended day block for these                   The school social worker is available to assist students having difficulty adjusting to the New York City educational  system and the demands of participating in their new educational environment.                    Parents are an essential ingredient in the success of all students, especially those who are new to an English language  school system.  In order to assist the parents with helping their children to succeed, P.S. 343 employs a full-time bilingual  Spanish Parent Coordinator. The parent coordinator, the social worker and teachers hold parent meetings and various  workshops throughout the year where they may learn about the Common Core Curriculum, standards, assessments, and how  to help their children at home. These workshops provide parents/guardians with the opportunity to attend a variety of family  literacy and math workshops, so they can better assist in the education of their children at home.  Parents will be coached in  Math strategies and problem solving.  Parents will also become familiar with the new CCL ENL Learning Standards and the  NYSESLAT.  They will also become familiar with the ELA Performance Standards.  Our staff will continuously work to involve  parents further in their children’s academic success.  All teachers continue to work to improve communication with the  families of our ELL students. Flyers for all parent activities are posted on our bulletin board in the lobby on the main floor and  sent home in several languages.               P.S.343Q uses the services of translators with the ability to prepare written correspondence to go out to the parents of  the various language groups as well as to be available to translate the written responses from the parents.  This goes a great  way in empowering the parents of the school community to express themselves in their native tongue and foster a greater  understanding between the school, teachers, and parents in order to ease the transition for their newly arrived student  children.  We brought parents and students of early registered Kindergarten students in before the start of school in  September for evaluation and to discuss our programs with parents in a one-on-one environment. Parents were able to meet  relevant staff and engage in discussion and ask any questions. We also always encourage parents to attend ELL parent  conferences offered by the Department of Education.                As previously stated, within the classroom, teachers will be employing ENL methodologies with all ELL students.  For  newly arrived students, teachers can pair the student with a buddy who speaks the student’s first language in order to provide  assistance as needed.  A title III program will become available for ELL students.  Newcomer groups could be formed to provide  basic vocabulary and communication skills.  Since the educational environment and individual situation for each student is  different it is helpful to gather as much information as possible about the educational level of new students through formal  and informal assessments to determine the educational level.                 Picture dictionaries,  along with picture collections provide basic vocabulary development for newcomers.  P.S.343Q  has computers in all the classrooms.      d. There are no long term ELLs at this time.   e. Commanding students are serviced by ENL teachers for 90 minutes a week as per the CR-Part 154.2.  They will have direct  instruction activities to support language development. They will also be offered the opportunity to participate in the Title III  Program for ELLs. They will be invited to partake in any of the activities offered to ELLs. Monitoring of their progress and  providing the monolingual teachers with support through professional development opportunities will also help these  students as they continue learning English in a supportive environment. All former ELLs who achieved a level of proficiency   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      within the last two years receive the same testing modifications as ELLs for in class assessments. We ensure that all former  ELLs receive all ELL testing accommodations for two years after they exit the program. Former ELLs participate in the ENL  programas these students  remain in the ENL classes as transitional students for up to two years. These students also receive  continued support and communication with their ENL teacher.  NYSESLAT scores are shared with the classroom teachers in  order to enable them to tailor instruction to the needs of former ELL students.  Staff development and ENL instructional  strategies are shared with all teachers on each grade level, not just teachers with ELL students.  This approach ensures that all  teachers who have former ELL students in their classes are versed in the approaches which are successful with students from  other than English language backgrounds.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   •   Beginner/Entering level SWD students receive 180 minutes standalone ENL plus 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA for a total  of 360 minutes.    •   Low Intermediate/Emerging SWD students receive 90 minutes standalone ENL, 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA and 90  minutes standalone or integrated ENL or any other content area.  •   Intermediate/Transitioning SWD students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction plus 90 minutes standalone  or integrated ENL or any other content area.  •   Advanced/Expanding SWD Students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area instruction.   •   Proficient/Commanding SWD students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or ENL/other content area instruction.    ELL students with disabilities whose IEP recommends ENL or bilingual instruction are provided with the appropriate  instructional strategies and setting as per the IEP recommendations and goals. These students are part of small-group  instruction on a daily basis which helps them to focus more easily. Because of their learning disabilities, these students require  a small group. This small group setting allows these students more “talk-time” and “question-time.” This also allows the  teachers to assess if the students are completing their “next steps” on a regular basis. Leveled classroom libraries, varied  computer programs such as  RAZ KIds and Brain Pop focus on all four modalities: listening, speaking, reading, and writing.                  Students are also provided with all grade-level books for all content based subjects (Science, Social Studies, Math).  Many language-based activities are done within the school and within the classroom. All these activities, plus the  differentiated instruction help to accelerate English language development. These students may also be given one-on-one  instruction which assures that they are completing their tasks in class and helps to scaffold what they have trouble  understanding. This one-on-one time also helps them achieve their IEP goals.               7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ●     P.S.  343  has ELL students with special needs in I.C.T (Integrated Co-teaching) settings.  Flexible programming at our  school ensures that ELL-SWDs experience maximum time spent with non-disabled peers. All students pa rticipate in school-  wide events together and common grades attend class trips together.  All students heterogeneously participate in schoolwide  activities and perform in shows together, such as the Winter and Spring Celebrations of Learning.   ●     ELL-SWDs receive the same mandated minutes of ENL services as students in the general education environment  •   Beginner/Entering level students receive 180 minutes standalone ENL plus 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA for a total of  360 minutes.    •   Low Intermediate/Emerging students receive 90 minutes standalone ENL, 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes  standalone or integrated ENL or any other content area.  •   Intermediate/Transitioning students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction plus 90 minutes standalone or  integrated ENL or any other content area.  •   Advanced/Expanding Students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area instruction.   •   Proficient/Commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or ENL/other content area instruction.                Currently, ELL students with special needs are serviced through the integrated and stand-alone model.  Using both  program models ensure time (and group size) mandates are met.  In this case, the group size would not exceed 12 students in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      order to fulfill the mandates of the student’s IEP.  Instruction is developed pertaining to the matters of grouping, teaching  methodology, testing accommodations and assessment, through the information provided on the student’s IEP.               Flexible programing at our school ensures that ELL-SWDs experience maximum time spent with non-disabled peers. All  students participate in school wide events together, common grades attend class trips together, and school wide  activities.  General Ed ELL students and ELL-SWDs also work on projects together and participate in hands on investigation  activities in both math and science. All students heterogeneously participate in extra-curricular activities and perform in shows  together, such as Winter and Spring School Performances.                 ELL students who are classified as Special Education or have been referred to the CSE are provided with small group  instruction within their classroom setting. These small groups allow these students to focus, as well as have more attention.  These groups also keep them more engaged in the strategy being worked on, as they can share their ideas and ask questions  more often. The students can conference on a similar skill within that small group and are given more time to  participate.  Brain Pop Junior and RAZ kids are used in the ELA content areas as described.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The ENL teacher and classroom teachers provide small group instruction as a form of intervention to students in need.  These  students include, but are not limited to, those students not meeting grade level benchmarks, students who did not progress on  NYSESLAT, and students performing below grade level.      Our teachers offer intervention services to these children throughout the year, focusing on each child’s specific area of  need.  Small group instruction is done throughout the school day in very small groups. There will be an after-school Title III  program which will use both formal and informal assessments to group the students.  The focus will be to strengthen language  skills in the 4 modalities while reinforcing content.  We are in the process of planning the program and more information will  be available at a later time.        Intervention Services for ELLs throughout the school year focus on each ELL’s specific areas of strengths and weaknesses.  The  data for targeting the student’s strengths and weaknesses are gathered from NYSESLAT, class assessments, MOSL performance  tasks in both ELA and Math.  Teachers communicate with parents and any other staff member who is involved in the students’  academic success.  This is accomplished, in part, during weekly Teacher Team Meetings and Inquiry.  Teams are comprised of  teachers who teach the same grade and subject.  During these meetings student work is reviewed, analyzed and  evaluated.  This enables teachers to share scaffolds, best practices, and plan for effective ways to address students’ individual  strengths, weaknesses and educational needs. ENL teachers also participate in these meetings to address language-related  instructional issues as well as issues that relate to the individual needs of students receiving ENL instruction and various ways  to scaffold and differentiate instruction.  During these meetings recommendations are made for SETTS and other related  services for ELLs with IEPs.   Targeted instruction in science and social studies is provided through small group instruction in the classroom.     These interventions include:  o   Small Group Instruction or conferencing  o   Individual Conferencing  o   Scaffolded Instruction  o   After School Title III program        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on data and trends, our students' greatest need is in the reading and writing modalities of the NYSESLAT. The program  that may be considered for the upcoming school year (depending on Title III budget) is an After-School program to target ELLs  who have difficulty obtaining proficiency on the Reading or Writing portion of the NYSESLAT. An improvement we are trying to  make is to use even more data-driven instruction than ever before. We will do this by analyzing all four modalities of the  NYSESLAT and taget student weaknesses based on the data.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   After analyzing parent surveys, they revealed parents preferred their children had ENL services in English over a bilingual  program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  The Children’s Lab School instructional vision is expressed in our motto “ground and sky.” We believe that every child deserves  an education that provides a solid grounding in core academic skills and gives them the opportunity to develop their  imaginations and creativity. The goal is to provide English Language Learners and their English-speaking peers the visual and  tactile experiences that give rise to rich language and rigorous inquiry. As a vehicle to attaining this goal, our school plans on  attaining a 6 week 2016-17 CEP 67 science program called Invent A Wheel this year with City College. Invent A Wheel has  provided English Language Learners attending Title I public schools with a sensory-rich visual media curricula and instruction  that encourages students’ self-expression and builds their skills to scaffold language development. This 6 week unit develops  energy concepts through children’s attempts to get something to slide, and eventually, roll downs a ramp and in the end  create a car. The key concepts are gravitational energy and friction. Students draw and write about their cars – first by showing  the assembled car with parts labeled, and then by creating a How-to Book explaining how to make one. At the end of the unit,  students improve on their designs, mechanically and esthetically, and in the final lesson present their cars to an audience. The  activities embedded in this unit reinforce second language development and academic language through: production and  distribution of writing, researching to build and present knowledge, demonstrating command of the conventions of standard  English grammar and usage when writing or speaking, demonstrating or clarifying the meaning of unknown and multiple  meaning words and phrases.     Sequential lessons and multi-step procedures help to develop higher level thinking skills and take literacy beyond vocabulary  development, such as audience and the purpose of communication. The focus of this unit is to combine our inquiry-based  approach to instruction with science, technology and engineering. The program will consist of weekly classes jointly taught by  the kindergarten classroom teacher and ENL teacher. The director of engineering and science from The City College which is  the program facilitator will visit classrooms to support teachers with instruction. All teachers will participate in PD sessions.  Additional planning time will be incorporated into our weekly Tuesday PD sessions. A parent workshop will be provided and  student work will be presented at the parent showcase in February.    This year the Children's Lab School will continue a Title III supplemental after-school program to target ELLs who have difficulty  obtaining proficiency on the Reading or Writing portion of the NYSESLAT. We will do this by analyzing all four modalities of the  NYSESLAT and target student weaknesses based on the data. ELL students are invited to participate in all programs through  letters sent home to parents in their preferred languages.     All ELL students are afforded equal access to all school programs. ELL students are included in every school program, including  Art, Physical Education and Music. This is ensured by every class being scheduled equally on the school’s prep schedule. Every  class also has the opportunity to participate in every school activity and special event equally. Some of these activities include  the Winter and Spring Celebration of Learning and Field Trips.    If any ELL student should require Speech, SETTS, Special Education, Occupational Therapy or Physical Therapy, the service is  offered and provided to them as required.    Sunnyside Community Services provides a free after school program for all students, including ELLs.  This afterschool program  meets Monday-Friday from 2:30pm - 5:30pm.  Students receive homework help and participate in a variety of activities.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Visual aids, Promethean Boards, charts, CDs, videos, document cameras, computer programs and Flipcharts are incorporated  into the instructional day.  They reinforce student learning through the different modalities: Visual, auditory, kinesthetic and  tactile.  These methods increase background knowledge, auditory perception, reading ability, decoding and comprehension.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         We have an extensive library of children's literature in Spanish and in combined books Spanish and English. Other curricular  materials are translated by the teachers. Entering and Emerging ELLs are provided with additional visual supports to increase  their access to the learning.  ELLs also use Lexia, which is an online program that is constantly assessing and providing specific  targeted lessons for the students to complete. The directions come in a variety of languages.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is utilized in the ENL program in order to facilitate meaning and activate prior knowledge. The  integrated ENL teacher and some classroom teachers are bilingual and provide native language support in Spanish during  instruction through clarification of concepts and key vocabulary in English and in the native language.  A Spanish Home  Language Library is accessible in the ENL classroom.  New students are also paired up with a buddy that speaks their home  language to give them social support, which in turn makes them more comfortable academically.              14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Support services and resources correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels as evidenced by the explanation of programs and  services mentioned above.  The Children’s Lab School will ensure that required services and resources support our ELLs' ages  and grade levels. Every effort will be made to provide every ELL student with the necessary age and level appropriate high- interest materials, books and supplies to peak their interest.          15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Not applicable.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   All parents of new admits who qualify for ELL services are invited to a parent orientation explaining their right to choose a  program for their child. Students who are Newcomers are strategically placed in classrooms for peer support.  In June, the  incoming Kindergarten class and potential ELLs participate in NYSITELL/ Spanish LAB-R Kindergarten screening with a qualified  ENL teacher.  The purpose of this early screening is to gather data surrounding early literacy/ bilingualism before the children  begin school.  This data gathered is shared with classroom teachers to drive instruction.  Students struggling with basic literacy  concepts are placed with highly qualified teachers on the grade.  The data gathered from this screening is also shared with  parents over the summer and they are given strategies to support their children at home before they begin school in  September.  Throughout the year, ELLs and parents communicate with the school counselor, parent coordinator, ENL and  classroom teachers, and other administration to encourage their attendance to work shops and parent nights.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Not applicable.           18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  In this school year, P.S. 343 will hold professional staff development workshops geared toward teachers with ELL students in  their classes. This includes both general education and special education teachers of ELLs. Staff development will be conducted  by the ELL Coordinator as well as the Department of Education staff developers. Workshop topics specifically geared toward  the ENL program may include: Unpacking NYSESLAT and Using NYSESLAT Test Results to Drive Instruction. ENL teachers will  participate in Webinars and a few professional development opportunities offered through the Office of English Learners.  Teachers of ELLs will be invited to participate in a variety of workshops offered by the Department of Education, which will be  determined at a later time. In addition to teaching staff, our speech therapist is working closely with our ENL teacher to  provide coordinated language services to our ELLs with IEPs. She is attending additional PD workshops in Wilson Fundations  phonics program which is proving to be a highly effective program for our ELLs. Our paraprofessionals attend our regularly- scheduled PD sessions on Tuesday afternoons along with our teachers. Our parent coordinator and school secretary attend  training sessions offered by the Borough Field Support Center.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All staff including the ESL and bilingual teachers attend school wide professional development focused on planning and  preparation using the common core learning standards. The focus this year for ELL Staff Development is to create a  professional learning community centered in supporting ELLs as they engage and negotiate meaning with the Common Core  Learning Standards. The program facilitator from The City College Invent a Wheel Science Program will offer professional  development to teachers which will assist in implementing and instruction of the 6 week unit. Specific workshops topics that  will be offered to staff will be determined at a future time by the PD Committee. Also the ELL Coordinator/ ENL teachers and  Bilingual teachers plan on attending upcoming professional development opportunities held by the Office of English Language  Learners focusing on the continued alignment of the 2016 NYSESLAT exam with the common core learning standards.  Information that is gained from these workshops is then shared with classroom teachers and ELL personnel as a means of  building their professional capacity to work with ELLs.    There is ongoing ENL training for all staff members here at P.S. 343. This training exceeds the minimum hours required. Staff  may be given various workshops on the two designated Professional Development days at the start of the school year, Election  Day and on designated staff development days that include many varying topics that would help them with their ELL students.  Workshop topics will be determined in the near future by the professional development committee. Staff will also receive  training during Tuesday Conferences, as well as during the school day in the form of Intervisitations and during common preps.  In the past, various staff members have attended various workshops offered by the (DELLS) Office of English Language  Learners. We will continue to check the DELLSS website and sign up for workshops that we feel will be helpful. Staff members  continue to attend workshops offered by the UFT as well. In addition, staff developers from the Queens North Field Support  Center visit our school and offer ENL workshops that involve many staff members, including ELL teachers.  Records of all  workshops are maintained in the form of sign-in sheets, agendas, and certificates of attendance given to the teachers upon  request. We keep copies on file.              Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59            The ENL Teachers in collaboration with the Parent Coordinator and Language Proficiency Team (LPT) will work together to  make provisions for interpretations and translations, both oral and written, of all pertinent information. Individual meetings  will be held to discuss the goals and progress of ELL students.  ENL teachers and classroom teachers will utilize Monday  afternoons to contact parents during parent engagement time.  Records of these meetings will be kept in a log by individual  teachers. They will include date, time, and information discussed.  Translators will be used as necessary.  Staff translators  include the ENL teacher, parent coordinator, paras, and the bilingual subject area teachers.          2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Parent involvement at P.S. 343 is ongoing and conducted in cooperation with the parent coordinator. Parents are included and  invited to many activities, workshops, and meetings held here at our school. This, of course, includes the parents of ELLs.       Parents of newly enrolled Kindergarteners were invited to bring their children for assessment in June as well as to meet with  ENL staff to discuss our program and to have an opportunity to ask questions in a one-on-one setting. Parents are given an  opportunity to "Meet and Greet" the teachers at a parent orientation for all grade levels at the start of the school year. This  includes meeting with all service providers and enrichment teachers who explain their programs and share information with all  parents. Throughout the school year, we offer workshops to all parents that include many subject areas, such as: Math, ENL,  Reading and Writing just to name a few.  The parents association will sponsor a Halloween Parade at the school on October  30.  Parents are invited to the Winter and Spring Celebrations of Learning.   We will also host an International Dinner in  December where families will make meals for the school to enjoy and create a school recipe book.       There are also monthly parent workshops offered to the families by the social worker on a variety of topics which  include:  Transitioning from Pre-K to K,  and How to help parents manage child behavior at home.  The physical education  teacher will host a workshop this November dealing with Nutrition and Exercise.     Our parent coordinator speaks both English and Spanish. She speaks to parents of ELLs on a daily basis, addressing their  questions and concerns and encourages them to participating in school events. She also provides both translation and  interpretation services. Translation and interpretation in languages other than Spanish are provided through the DOE  Translation and Interpretation unit. We have purchased interpretation equipment and offer simultaneous interpretation at all  public events.     Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, BROOKE BARR, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Children's Lab School                                                                              School DBN: 24Q343  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      P.S. 343Q is committed to providing all students with the maximum opportunity to learn and achieve academic  success. Therefore, it is essential to encourage parents to become involved through effective communication  between our school and the families of our students. In order to make effective communication possible between  our school and the families of our students, data from our Adult Preferred Language Report (RAPL) is utilized to  determine our school's written translation and oral interpretation needs. In addition, the emergency contact  cards which are filled out by parents, request that they identify the language they prefer for written and oral  communication from the school. Their language communication preference is kept on file at our school.
