This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   P.S. 321 is large neighborhood public elementary school in Park Slope, Brooklyn, with over 1400 students. It is vibrant  and diverse educational community where children have an opportunity to learn through an inquiry based, workshop  approach. In our heterogeneously grouped classrooms, children learn to become part of a classroom and school  community that fosters not only tolerance but true respect for all people.   Our school strives to help children obtain the tools they need to become educated, effective global citizens. This  means providing a rich curriculum the includes reading, writing, math, social studies, science, and the arts. During   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      reading workshop, children work independently, in partnerships, and in small groups to gain a deep understanding of  literature at their appropriate reading level. Our writing process approach meets children where they are, introduces  them to a variety of genres, and moves them forward. They learn spelling and phonics as tools for reading and  writing. Our balanced math curriculum combines teaching deep conceptual understanding with the ability to compute  efficiently and accurately. We believe that all children need opportunities to explore throught the arts, and children at  P.S. 321 have instruction in music, visual arts, and dance. We help children learn to think creatively and analytically  and to develop independence as learners. We want our students to develop fully as individuals and also as  cooperative, responsible members of a group.   Our standards-based curriculum recognizes that all children can learn when they have clear expectations within  academically rigorous classrooms. We recognize that children learn in a variety of ways, however, and that we need  to be sensitive to differences in learning styles and to provide additional support for children who need it if all  children are going to be able to meet the increasingly rigorous Common Core Standards.             2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P.S. 321 is a zoned elementary school with approximately 1420 students. Approximately 14% of our students have  IEPs, and we have two ICT classes on each grade. Our curriculum is differentiated to meet the needs of the diverse  learners in our classrooms. This year we are striving towards having most of our intervention services be provided in a  push-in model.       We work closely with Teachers College Reading and Writing Project, using their framework and approach but  modifying it to meet the needs of our students. We have been a TCRWP school for over 35 years. During reading  workshop, children work independently, in partnerships, and in small groups to gain a deep understanding of  literature at their appropriate reading level. Our writing process approach meets children where they are, introduces  them to a variety of genres, and moves them forward. Children learn spelling and phonics as tools for reading and  writing. In math, we have made recent changes in our curriculum, increasingly using the modules from ENGAGE NY.  This year we are setting aside a lot of our PD time to focus on implementation of the Engage Curriculum. We embrace  the content standards in math, and also the Standards of Practice. We believe that all children need opportunities to  explore through the arts, and children at P.S. 321 have instruction in music, visual arts, and dance. Some of this is  provide through DOE certified arts teachers, some through collaborations with Together in Dance, the Brooklyn  Conservatory of Music, and Creative Music. We help children learn to think creatively and analytically and to develop  independence as learners. We want our students to develop fully as individuals and also as cooperative, responsible  members of a group.       Choice is an important part of our approach, and we understand that children learn best when they have some choice  and ownership over their own learning. We recognize that children learn in a variety of ways, and that we need to be  sensitive to differences in learning styles and to provide additional support for children who need it if all children are  going to be able to meet the expectations of the Common Core State Standards.       As our school has become less diverse racially and economically, due to changes in the neighborhood, we are ivery  committed to making sure that all students, whatever their race, class, gender preference, or disability, feel  supported in school. In the coming year we are working with Raising Race Conscious Children, an organization that   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      will be providing professional development for staff as well as a series of three parent workshops. In addition, we are  devoting other professional development time to social emotional learning.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   14% of our students have IEPs and their needs vary tremendously. We meet the needs of our most seriously disabled  students in ICT classes. We have students with autism, learning disabilities, speech and language delays, OT issues,  and health issues. In addition to ICT classes, we offer SETSS support and have 3 full time speech teachers, 3 OTs, and 2  PTs.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The framework is a useful tool for describing and explaining much of our success as a school. We are known for our  rigorous instruction, and our outstanding teachers are dedicated to professional development that allows them to  grow as learners. The level of collaboration among our teachers and their dedication to professional development is  remarkable. They work with staff developers from Teachers College Reading and Writing Project and The Math  Collective, and also participate in PD provided through Brooklyn North Field Support Center. In addition to Monday  PD, we build grade-based professional development into our schedule, and each grade meets one period every other  week during school time. Teachers facilitate grade meetings and open their doors to their colleagues from within and  outside of the school on a regular basis. We have very effective school leadership, as evidenced by the strong  relationships that teachers have with administrators. The principal is in her 20 th year as principal and works  collaboratively with three outstanding and well respected Assistant Principals. But our effective leadership involves  teacher leaders as well. Our math leaders have been essential in leading the school as we’ve raised expectations in  mathematics. Our grade leaders serve as literacy leaders and keep their colleagues on track by sending out monthly  email reminders about pacing and curriculum. They also help develop topics for grade meetings. Our technology  leaders are instrumental in not only providing technology support to colleagues, but in working collaboratively with  families to propose technology priorities for the future. Our Framework scores from the 2016 Scoreboard Dashboard  are in the "Exceeding Expectations" (the highest category). This will be the fourth year that we are serving as a Host  School through Learning Partners, this year through a continuation grant.       The technology committee mentioned above is one of countless examples of the strong family-community ties. Our  technology committee is comprised of parents, teachers, and administrators and meets monthly. In addition to  setting priorities and providing support, they organized and ran an outstanding Family Technology Day. Our Green  and Healthy Committee also includes parents, teachers, and administrators. That committee sponsors many events  that involve families, including two Harvest days and a Green and Healthy Family Night attended by close to 1000  people. Our Diversity Committee of parents and teachers organized a “Quilt of Heroes” for Black History Month,  sponsored workshops, and organized a highly successful Diversity Family Night: “Around the World in 80 Minutes.”  We were a "No Place for Hate" school for the second year in 2017-18, and will continue this program in the coming  year. We have so many other examples of family involvement in our school. The first Friday of every month is “Family  Friday” and we have over 1000 family members in our classrooms reading and doing math games or other activities  with their children. We have an excellent website for the school and many teachers have class websites. We  communicate frequently with families through meetings, letters, and our weekly “E-Bulletin.” Parents feel supported  by the school, and in the 2018 Parent Survey, 97% responded positively to the "Outreach to Parents" questions and  98% responded positively to "Parent Involvment in School" questions. 98% responded positively to the "Parent- Principal Trust" questions; and and 98% responded positively to the "Parent-Teacher Trust" questions.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      In terms of a supportive environment, one needs only to walk into the building to feel that PS 321 is a very special  community that supports our students and also our teachers and staff. Our school survey results are a tangible  example of this. In our 2018 survey, 97% of teachers say that the principal places the needs of children ahead of  personal interests; 100% of teachers say that teachers respect other teaches who take the lead in school  improvement efforts, and 100% of teachers say that the professional staff believes that all students can learn,  including English language learners and students with disabilities.       None of the above could happen so successfully without the high level of trust in the school. That trust involves all the  constituencies in the community—students, parents, teachers, and administrators. That is evident in the statistics  cited above as well as in the fact that in the 2018 survey, 98% of parents responded positively to the "Parent-Principal  Trust" questions and 98% responded positively to the "Parent-Teacher Trust" questions. In this survey, 98% of  teachers say that "the principal encourages feedback through regular meetings with parent and teacher leaders" and  100% of teachers say that "the principal has conficence in the expertise of the teachers in the school."                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 15K321   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1421   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     As a high performing school our students do well on a variety of measures. For the past three years, our test scores  have been a less accurate measure of student achievement because of a high opt out rate (approximately 36% in  2014-15 ; 40% in 2015-16; 36% in 2016-17; and 39% in 2017-18). However, they have still remained somewhat  comparable to previous years when we had no opt outs. Although in absolute terms our Math test scores are higher  than our ELA scores, we know that is true across the state and comparatively, we do better in ELA. For example, in  2013-14, when we had accurate results, 5th grade math we are ranked 40th in the city, coming in the 95.15  percentile. Although this is still good, in that same grade in ELA we are ranked 9th in the city. Therefore, we do see  math as an area we need to work on. As a school with many high performing students, one of our challenges is  meeting the needs of these students at the same time that we address the needs of students performing below grade  level. We are of course committed to working hard to improve the performance of our special needs students, our  English Language Learners, and all of our students who have not met grade level standards, but our goals are to  improve performance for all of our students, from our highest performing to our lowest performing. Our needs  assessment is ongoing and includes analysis of state test scores; analysis of end-of-unit and end-of-year math  assessments; discussion with teachers at grade meetings that are built into the school day for one hour every other  week per grade; our IPCs (one on one meetings) with teachers; feedback from parents in grade by grade parent  meetings with the principal that are held in the fall and spring; discussions in SLT meetings; analysis of the NYC School  Survey and discussions weekly cabinet meetings. Although we received “Well Developed” in all the QR instructional  core indicators, our focus area for improvement was 2.2, “Align assessments to curricula, use on-going assessment  and grading practices, and analyze information on student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the  team and classroom levels.” One of the budgetary decisions made as a result of our needs assessment was to have a  math coach for two year (15-16 and 16-17) who could lead us in improving our math curriculum and assessment. For  the 2018-19 school year, we have contracted with two math professional development organizations--Generation  Ready and an organization offer PD in CGI (cognitively guided instruction). This past year for the first time grades 1-5  all taught 3-6 Engage New York modules, and the results have been positive in terms of the math accomplishments of  students and the enthusiasm of parents for our math program.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15      MATH—By June 2019, 80% of students will meet end of year grade level benchmarks in math as measured by a  combination of end of unit assessments, end-of-year math assessments, and state exams. In addition, students will all  experience tackling a wide variety of rich problems and will be able to persevere with challenging problems.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   All teachers will follow the Common Core aligned math pacing  calendar developed and revised by teachers and administrators  in spring/summer 2018. This pacing calendar is now fully CCS  aligned and includes attention to the “Standards for  Mathematical Practice” as well as the content area math  expectations for each grade. Kindergarten will place a stronger  emphasis on introducing Engage NY models including number  bonds and number paths and will also do CGI lessons twice a  week. First grade will teach 3 “Engage New York” math units.  Second-fifth grade will teach 5-6 Engage Modules per grade.  Math leaders on each grade will provide colleagues with  supplemental material to help implement new units and provide  materials for differentiation; they have also worked to translate  many lessons to a more inquiry based approach. Part of the work  of math leaders will be to provide guidance to colleagues in  implementing the Engage New York modules, which are quite  rigorous.   Math professional development will continue to be a priority for  the school year. We will continue our collaboration with the  Math Collective/Kate Abel. Many of our teachers will participate  in Math PD through Brooklyn North. And this year for the first  time we have contracted for 10 days of math professional  development through Generation Ready for grades 1-5 and a few  days of CGI training for Kindergarten teachers through a  consultant who is an expert in CGI. Math leaders will lead  professional development for colleagues, and we will set focus at  least one PD session per month on math, mainly on supporting  teachers in implementing Engage New York Units, on CGI, and on  differentiation of instruction in math. Our math website has been  updated and provides videos, games, lesson descriptions, and  other supports for teachers.    Teachers will provide differentiated instruction through small  group instruction, leveled math games, and one on one  conferring. In addition, 5th graders who need additional support  in math will be taught in a smaller math class of approximately  16 children by a highly skilled math teacher. Some math  intervention will be provided to other grades .

In  4th and 5th grade, math will be taught at least 7 periods a week.  In grades 1-3, in addition to at least one period a day of math  workshop, teachers will build in an extra 50 minutes of math into  the week through problem of the day, week or month or routines  focused on math. In Kindergarten, all teachers will teach at least  one period of math per day, which will include math routines.      We have purchased several apps and sets of 4-6 IPADs or  Chrome books for all ICT classes and clustered SETSS classes and  will install math apps on these that can be used at home and in  school            All teachers  and students               Selected  students  grades K-5            All assistant  principals and  principal                         We spent time in June 2018 and will spend time in September as  well analyzing the results from the end of year math assessments  both for information on individual students and for trends that  will have an impact on designing instruction. We will give these  carefully constructed grade wide assessments in late May again;  and will spend time analyzing the results in June.                We will provide additional opportunities for students to practice  math games and participate in enrichments through after school  “Kids Clubs.” All first grades will have a 1x a week Math Games  specialty class for the second half of the year.       All teachers  and their  students            Children in all grades will have an opportunity to study integrated  curriculum projects that include math. For example, 5th graders  culminate the year with independent math projects; 4th graders  do data projects; 3rd graders do “rain forest math” as part of this  social studies unit; 2nd graders integrate math into their plant  study and their bird study; 1st graders neighborhood studies  include math; kindergarten students integrate math into their  bridge and tree studies.

In terms of a supportive environment, one needs only to walk into the building to feel that PS 321 is a very special  community that supports our students and also our teachers and staff. Our school survey results are a tangible  example of this. In 2018 our School Quality Snapshot indicates that 95% responded positively to questions about  "Supportive Environment." This compares to 86% in the district and 83% citywide. 98% of teachers say that "adults in  this school teach students how to advocate for themselves."       As a high performing school our students do well on a variety of measures. For the past two years our test scores have  been a less accurate measure of student achievement because of a high opt out rate (see above). However, they have  still remained somewhat comparable to previous years when we had no opt outs. Our ELA scores are extremely  high—for example, based on the 2014 exams our fifth grade scores were 9th in NYC, with most of the schools above  us being screened gifted programs. However, we also know that part of our strength is our deep commitment to  always improving. And, as a school with many high performing students, one of our challenges is meeting the needs  of these students at the same time that we address the needs of students performing below grade level. We have  focused explicitly on this with our ICT teams , who have 3 days of professionals development throughout the year led  by an expert in social emotional learning and meeting the needs of children with challenges. We are of course  committed to working hard to improve the performance of our special needs students, our English Language  Learners, and all of our students who have not met grade level standards, but our goals are to improve performance  for all of our students, from our highest performing to our lowest performing. We believe that one of the reasons why  our students so well is that there is a school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their  teachers and peers. We have professional development that addresses meeting the social/emotional needs of  students. We have a very low suspension rate and our guidance counselors are proactive, running lunch groups for  children who need extra support in getting along with peers. We fund an “at risk” guidance counselor in addition to  our mandated counselor. Our needs assessment is ongoing and includes discussion with teachers at grade meetings  that are built into the school day for one hour every third week; our IPCs (one on one meetings) with teachers; our  monthly Pupil Personnel Committee meetings; feedback from parents in grade by grade parent meetings with the  principal that are held in the fall and spring; discussions in SLT meetings; discussions at diversity committee; an  analysis of the NYC School Survey; feedback at monthly No Place For Hate committee meetings; and weekly cabinet  meetings. An essential aspect of our supportive environment is a rich and engaging curriculum that is accessible to all  students. Creating a supportive environment for learning is a critical goal for PS 321 and permeates all of what we do.  Our rich curriculum supports children in many ways, as does the element of choice that is critical to our workshop  approach to teaching. Our integrated curriculum units are ones that appeal to all students and allow for multiple  access points.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22     Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, 95% of students will have signed the "No Place for Hate" promise and participated in "No Place for  Hate" Activities. In addition, all students will have access to a rich curriculum that depends on collaboration and  includes at least two integrated curriculum units per grade as well as significant guided choice across the curriculum in  Readers Workshop, Math Workshop, and Writers Workshop as determined by observations by supervisors. In  addition, 95% of students in the school will have been introduced to how to use "The Peace Path" to resolve conflicts.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

For the 3rd year, we will be a “No Place for Hate” school,  working with the ADL to implement this program that will  include a pledge by all students and specific activities geared  to address issues of respect and diversity.       In response to issues with use of digital media, we have  developed a K-5 Digital Citizenship curriculum that is highly  engaging and includes students interviewing their families.    A set of PS 321 Community Standards is introduced the first  day of school and referred to throughout the year. Each  teacher begins the year with several community  building/conflict resolution activities. Teachers also include  community building activities throughout the year and refer  back to the PS 321 Community Standards.        Teachers thoughtfully select materials and develop  curriculum that supports the respect initiative and the  diversity of our community. Fourth grades all have a unit of  “Social Issue Book Clubs,” and fifth grades all have a unit of  “Global Issue Book Clubs.”      An active Parent Diversity Committee that includes staff  representatives celebrates the diversity of our community  and raises awareness about respecting differences.

We will have an SEL  committee of staff, a new SEL website with resources for  staff and parents, and will host several SEL workshops for  families. A survey administered last spring showed a great  deal of parent interest in SEL workshops.

This year based  on some negative feedback last year, rather than contract  with Kids in the Game we will work with "Run for Fun" to  have 2 recess coaches during our lunch periods and grade  recess. In addition, we have changed the 5th grade lunch  period to coincide with kindergarten, allowing for fewer  students in the back yard and giving 5th graders a chance to  support our youngest students. We will paint a "Peace Path"  in both the front and back yard for students to use during  recess to help resolve conflicts.      Because we believe collaboration is one of the keys to a  supportive environment, all students will have an  opportunity to work in a partnership or small group at least  three times a week. Teachers teach lessons the help children  to work collaboratively and compromise.       Because we find that integrated curriculum units are highly  engaging and accessible to all students, all classrooms will  have at least two such units that integrate reading, writing,  math, the arts, and either social studies or science. These  units will include opportunities to work collaboratively with  partners and/or small teams.

Children in the upper grades will have an  opportunity to produce independent reading and writing  projects. Children in the early childhood grades will  participate in choice time—daily in kindergarten and three  times a week in first grade. One of the ways we get input  from students about what kinds of choices they would like to  have is that the three APs and the principal divide up the 4th  grade classes and have lunch in groups of 7-8 with all of our  250 fourth graders once during the year.

One structure is that teachers and one-on- one paraprofessionals complete behavior tracking sheets for  students who struggle with behavioral issues that pinpoint  areas of strength and successful strategies for students.  These forms are passed on to next year’s teachers and one- on-one paraprofessionals. Our “Ask Andrea” program allows  teachers to sign up for a consultation/classroom observation  with an expert who will provide them with strategies for  working with challenging children.       A Green and Healthy Committee of parents and teachers  develops approaches and activities that encourage children  to respect their environment ant their bodies. January is  designated as “Green and Healthy Month,” and there is both  a curricular focus and a family night this month. This year,  we will be part of the Zero Waste initiative and several  teachers will participate in PD around this initiative. All  teachers will participate in G & H PD during January.      All classes go on multiple school trips, utilizing the rich  resources of New York City and allowing a diverse group of  students to have a shared experience to build on.

These free events bring  together diverse members of our community.       Through our ICT program and other initiatives, we make sure  that children with special needs are fully included in all  school curricular and extracurricular activities. Targeted PD  for ICT classes supports teachers in modifying curriculum to  meet the needs of all students, and ICT teachers turnkey this  work to their grade colleagues.       Last spring we began working on an ICT video to be used to  educate both general education and special education  parents about our ICT program. This film will be completed  in the fall and will be shown at selected parent meetings. In  the future, we hope to show this at curriculum conferences.      We have many opportunities for parents of special needs  children to attend workshops on social skills and to have  informal drop in meetings with the AP in charge of special  education. One of our parent SLT spots is designated in the  bylaws as being for a parent of a student with special needs.

The principal works closely with the PTA officers to implement these activities. They are also  discussed by the principal at the opening PTA meeting on 9/17 and at grade by grade parent meeting in the fall.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Our Quality review notes, under indicator 4.2, that “All staff are engaged in professional learning collaborations that  are frequently teacher led and focused on continually growing practices to meet the needs of a diverse population of  learners.” In the 2018 school survey, 100% of teachers say that "teachers are actively trying to improve their  teaching." 100% of teachers say that they "had opportunities wo work producively with colleagues at their school on  professional development." We believe that this area is a real strength of our community, and we put many  mechanisms in place to make sure it continues to happen. Because we are such a large school, however, we need to  have clear structures for collaboration that facilitate collaboration both within a grade and cross grades. In addition to  the collaboration within our school, we have learned a great deal from participating in cross-school collaboration  through Learning Partners for the past five years. Although this formal collaboration is over, we will continue to  informally collaborate with several of our previous learning partners. .         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.  By June 2019, all PS 321 teachers will have the opportunity to participate in at least 7 cycles of Professional  Development throughout the year, some of which are grade based and some of which are cross grade, that will occur on  Mondays or at grade meeting time. At least 12 teachers and administrators will participate in collaborations with  teachers outside of our school through our Learning Partners program, Teachers College Reading and Writing Project,  and the Math Collective.

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other  high-need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under- credited, SIFE, STH).   Our planning for our PD cycles is collaborative, based on  input from teachers at grade wide planning days, on data  collected by administrators on teacher forms collected at our  final summative conferences, and at a PD planning meeting  held on May 22, 2018.. This meeting was attended by eight  teachers (grade/cluster leaders), two assistant principals, and  the principal. In addition, at ongoing grade meetings and  administrative team meetings we analyze areas that we need  to focus more attention on based on our classroom visits and  looking at student work. A feature of our Monday PD is at  least three “DYO” (Design Your Own) PD cycles where  teachers make decisions about what kind of PD will best meet  their needs and work collaboratively to facilitate this.    With the input noted above, the principal will draft a plan for  the year for Monday PD cycles for classroom teachers, cluster  teachers, and paraprofessionals. This plan will be presented  at grade meetings in September and revised based on input.   In addition to Monday PD, classroom teachers will have grade  meetings every two weeks last period that are built into the  schedule. Based on what administrators observed in another  school and then presented at spring grade meetings and our  May PD meeting, we will reshape approximately half of our  grade meetings so that they include time looking at student  work and observing in classrooms.       We have three cross grade teams of teacher leaders that  meet regularly and help lead the work we do in various areas:  Grade Leaders (who focus on literacy and other school-wide  issues such as report cards); math leaders; and technology  leaders. In addition, we have two voluntary school-wide  teacher committees, one a diversity committee and one a  Social Emotional Learning Committee that include teachers  from grades K-5.

Our service providers and intervention teachers collaborate  with each other at monthly meetings and with classroom  teachers on an ongoing basis. Some of our Tuesday planning  time is used for this collaboration.      On professional development days as well as after school and  in the summer for per session pay, a few teachers collaborate  to revise units of study for their entire grade.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   In the 2018 School Survey, 100% of teachers say that the principal "takes a personal interest in the professional  development of teachers." 97% of teachers say that "the principal and assistant principals function as a cohesive  unit." This is extremely imporatnt, and clearly the expertise of our three outstanding assistant principals contributes  greatly to the effective leadership of the school. 100% of teachers say that "the principal makes clear to the staff his  or her expectations for meeting instructional goals," and 98% say that "the principal communicates a clear vision for  the school. 98% of parents feel that "the principal at their school promotes family and community involvement in the  school" and 97% say that "the principal encourages feedback from the community and them through regular  meetings."  The principal was designated a “host principal' through Learning Partners for four years (including a  continuation grant after regular participation was completed) in recognition of her leadership skills. In addition, she  was asked by the superintendent to facilitate a Leadership Group for APs from across the district who have the strong  potential to be effective principals. Anonymous eedback from these APs about the experience was extremely positive,  with one person writing, "The highlight for me was to have the opportunity to learn from someone who is as  exceptional and gifted leader as you are Liz." Another AP wrote, "You are full of so many ideas and important  structures that have continually moved the school toward high expectations for student and teachers...it has all been  incredibly valuable and I know I will be referring to all my notes, resources, and examples to move forward in my own  growth and career." In addition to the mentoring that took place in this group, I am proud of the number of my  former assistant principals and principal interns who are now principals throughout the city, from Park Slope to the  South Bronx.    Our effective leadership involves teacher leaders as well as supervisors. Our math leaders have been essential in  leading the school as we’ve raised expectations in mathematics. Our grade leaders serve as literacy leaders and keep  their colleagues on track by sending out monthly email reminders about pacing and curriculum. They also help  develop topics for grade meetings. Our technology leaders are instrumental in not only providing technology support  to colleagues, but in working collaboratively with families to propose technology priorities for the future. We believe  strongly in a collaborative leadership style, and on our 2018 survey, 100% of teachers say that at our school, "the  principal, teachers, and staff collaborate to make the school run effectively." And it is particularly important that  teachers are eager for colleagues to take on leadership roles. In the 2018 school survey, 100% of teachesr say that  "teachers respect other teachers who take the lead in school improvement efforts."         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

Our school is well-known as a model school for family involvement. In our last Quality Review , we received a “Well  developed in 3.4, “High Expectations,” with the review writing as a finding, “The school has established a culture for  learning that consistently communicates high expectations to staff and families toward students achieving college and  career readiness.” Under “Supporting Evidence,” the reviewer notes that: “ Parents serve as “Learning Friends,”  meeting weekly with an individual student. Close to 1,000 parents join teachers on the first Friday of every month for  Family Fridays where they participate in some aspect of the curriculum with their children. For example, parents  created dragon masks with their children as part of a social studies unit on China. Parents run enrichment club cycles  as part of “Kids Clubs.” They organize many parent “friend raisers” and meet regularly with the principal. Additionally,  parent volunteers support students in the computer lab and at kindergarten choice time.” On our 2018 School Survey,  98% of families say that "they get opportunities to visit tehir child's classroom, such as observing instruction or  participating in an activity with their child." 97% of families say that "they feel well-informed by the communications  they receive from their school." Teachers also attest to the close ties with families, with 100 present saying they  "regularly communicate with families about how they can help students learn. We have many community  "friendraisers," that we work closely with the PTA to sponsor, including pot luck dinners, Family concerts (including a  Staff Band Concert that sells out two showings each year), and Family nights organized around a theme such as Green  and Healthy or Diversity (Around the World in 80 minutes).         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.   By June 2019, 85% of our families will have attended at least two Family Fridays. 60% will have attended at least one  Family Night, workshop, or served on a committee.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed  to impact change.

The Principal will hold 12 grade-by-grade parent meetings—one  in fall and one in spring for each grade. These meetings,  generally attended by about 150 parents, include information on  the CCS expectations, on curriculum, and on other issues  particular to a grade. Parents are encouraged to submit agenda  items and ask questions.    Parents   Oct 2018- Dec 2018  and April- 2019-June  2019.   Principal    Family Fridays will be held beginning in October (on the first  Friday of the month) , and teachers set up activities that allow  parents to work with children and get a sense of our curriculum.  One of these Family Fridays (in March) becomes “Grandparents  and Special Friends Day,” and we expand the number of family  members and friends who spend time in our classrooms.   Parents,  grandparents,  and other  special  friends   Oct 2018- June 2019   Principal   Teachers will either establish class websites or send home  newsletters monthly, and these will include information on  curriculum, homework, and policies. The school will support  teachers who want to start websites by offer tech support  through tech leaders.    A “Learning Friend” program matches parent volunteers to  children who need extra support in literacy. We have 25  Learning Friends who meet weekly with one student each for  the entire year to support them in reading and writing. We will  try to expand our LF program to math this year.      The Green and Healthy Committee of parents and teachers will  meet monthly and organize two Harvest days and Green and  Healthy Night. They will coordinate activities for our January  “Green and Healthy Month.” All teachers participate G & H PD  for teachers during January.

Our Musical Theater program is a collaboration  with Together in Dance; our Band program is a collaboration  with the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music. In addition, parents  and teachers teach 8-week classes in our afterschool “Kids Club”  program.      The Parent Diversity Committee, which has a few teachers and  the principal on the committee, will work collaboratively with  teachers by holding some of their meetings at 7:50am so that  teachers are more likely to attend. This year the committee will  help to implement the “No Place For Hate” initiative, the No  Place for Hate bookclub, and will plan workshops and coordinate  the Quilt of Heroes for Black History Month.       A Teacher Diversity Committee that will meet after school and  help coordinate diversity PD and other projects.         We will organize workshops and meetings geared to parents of  children with IEPs.      Our Testing Task force is a staff/parent committee that meets  several times throughout the year with the goal of educating  families about state testing.

These are family concerts and introduce children to classical  music. They are open to the general public and are attended by  many who are not PS 321 families. Prior to one of these concerts  we will have a "music invasion" where all classes will get to hear  live musicians. We also hold two Staff Band concerts per year.  The Staff band includes approximately 5 staff members and  some community members. This concert is attended by families  and the larger community.                           teachers and  students   Sept 2018- June 2019      Our Meet the Writers Committee is run by parents and includes  the principal and an assistant principal. The committee is  responsible for organizing two visits per grade of published  children’s book authors. Each student in the school has the  experience of meeting two authors and hearing them talk about  the writing process.                           Parents sign up to receive a weekly “E-bulletin” that includes  important information about upcoming events, school initiatives  and other news. In addition, the PTA maintains a website that  includes detailed information about curriculum, calendar, DOE  and school policies, events, and more. And, our math website,  maintained by our math coach, includes many resources for  parents.       In an effort to help our students recognize the importance of  giving back to the community and the school, we involve them in  several service projects and initiatives that benefit those outside  of our community. Each fifth grade class will be in charge of a  service project for a month. We conduct an annual food drive  and an annual coat drive to benefit CHIPS and one other local  organization. Parent volunteers coordinate these drives but are  supported by students. All fifth grade classes also participate in a  day of service to an outside organization. Last year for the first  time we became part of a group of 50 schools that are ready to  respond to and collect supplies in the case of national or  international disasters.

On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54     State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of  this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school.  P.S. 321, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and  implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support  of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association,  and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S.321 will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   P.S. 321, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.

The focus of each group will depend on the needs of the students, so some might be  math focused, some literacy.  In all cases a focus will be on vocabulary development.     All  classes will be taught in English.  There will be 6 before school groups meeting on Wednesday and Thursday mornings from 8:00- 8:30am for 12 weeks.  There will be 6 content area teachers and a rotating ESL teacher.  There  will be 6 after school groups; half will meet on Wednesday, half will meet on Thursday, for 12  weeks.  Each day there will be a rotating ESL teacher and 3 content area teachers (for a total of 6  content area teachers in all after school.   Each group will include students from no more than  two grades (K-1; 2-3; 4-5).  Some of the groups will include students from only one  grade.   Materials used will include books; art materials; math games; and writing materials. The  groups will begin the week of February 11, 2019 and go through the week of  May 13, 2019.  We  have selected this model  based on an analysis of the success of previous interventions.   Looking  at growth in reading as measured by F & P running record assessments, the smaller our groups  were, the more successful our students were in moving book levels.  That is why we will have a  co-teaching model in cases where the group size is greater than 4 students.  During these  language- based activities, students will be engaged in guided reading groups; writing activities;  and in cases where the focus is math, solving word problems and reviewing math  vocabulary.   Students will be grouped by grade level and need, and the ratio of students to  teachers will be no more than 6 students to 1 content area teacher.    The ESL teacher will rotate  through the before and after school groups to provide more targeted ESL strategies and will  team-teach and sometimes work in flexible groupings. .

Four Monday PD cycles will focus on  professional readings, some of which will include books about meeting the needs of ELL  students and Immigrant students.  We will have teachers teaching in the Title III program  observe the ESL teacher working with students.   Given that our teachers have a wide range of  experience, the PD will be differentiated to meet various needs.  Some of the focuses of the  groups that teachers will participate in with Teachers College Reading and Writing Staff  Developers are: "Engaging Reluctant Writers," "Using Technology to Embrace the Tricky Parts  of our Practice," and "Giving our Teaching of Reading Traction Through Tools, Methods, and  Partnerships."  Our TCRWP staff developers are Cornelius Minor, Jen DeSutter, and Katie  Clements.  In math, Kindergarten teachers are being supported by CGI staff developers  Stephanie Smith and Debra Fuentes and in grades 1-5 teachers are provided professional  development through Generation Ready math expert Sue Morris.  Teachers will be able to select  specific PD cycles to meet their needs.  The only cost to the program for the professional  development is for four substitute teachers to cover teachers during the outside PD.  Other than  that, we fund this with funding through the PTA and using DOE employees.  Attendance will be  kept at PD sessions.

The  principal, guidance counselors, ELL teachers, PTA co-presidents and a Diversity Committee rep  will present information about homework, various supports we can provide to families, and the  Title III classes we will be offering.  We have a second breakfast scheduled for Friday, February  8.  We send notices home in Spanish and English, and will reach out personally to families who  speak other languages and are not fluent in English.    2.

On Tuesday, December 5 at 6:30 PM, Dr. Christopher  Willard will present a workshop entitled, "Raising Resilience: The Wisdom and Science of  Happy Families and Thriving Children."  At least three other workshops will be scheduled.  Most  of these workshops do not cost us anything.  In cases where a payment is necessary, the PTA will  pay the fees.  Attendance sheets will be collected and kept on file.    3. We  have open Library hours from 2:50-3:50 on Tuesdays when parents can come to the  school library with their children.   The school library teacher will help parents to select  appropriate books to read with their children and will have some projects that they can engage  in.   4. We have a special Family Night that celebrates cultures around the world that will take place  on May 23, 2019 with planning beginning in January.  This is an event that many of our  immigrant families participates in and that generally draws a crowd of over 500 children and  their parents.    5.  We will do special outreach to ELL Families for our Family Nights, which are scheduled as  follows:  Family Math Night--October 23; Family Arts Night--December 13-- Green and Healthy  Night, January 23; and Family Tech Day--March 23.    5. Our Parent Coordinator and Guidance Counselors meet informally with immigrant parents  frequently to answer individual questions.  6. All parents are encouraged to attend Family Fridays on the first Friday of every month, where  they spend time in the classroom reading, playing math games or doing art or other activities  with children.    We will notify parents of all these activities in fliers that will go in children's homework folders  as well as via email. We will also encourage our immigrant parents to continue some of the  structures they have put in place, including a book club that meets at various members houses.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The school uses Fountas and Pinell running records, on-demand writing pieces, and end of unit math assessments to track the  progress of ENL students. The data suggests that many of our students become fluent readers in English on grade level within  three years. These assessment tools allow the teacher to look carefully at  comprehension and vocabulary development as  well as  phonetic  understandings and conventions.  It is also interesting to note, children that are able to read grade level text  in  F&P are more likely to reach commanding level on the NYSESLAT. This allows us to predict  more acurately the students we  will continue serving and focus on student that require more support in English language development. This data allows us to  fine tune intervention services to pinpoint areas of individual students and target these skills.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Each teacher has a kit of F & P assessments.  We periodically look at on-demand writing and end of unit math assessments at  grade meetings or Monday PD sessions.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  In order to evaluate the success of the ELL's in our school we look  at Foutas and Pinnell running record assessments, teacher  developed grade-wide math assessment, ongoing conferences in math reading and writing, and the ELA, Math, and NYSESLAT  scores.  We meet AYP for ELLs.   Given the number of students who reach grade-level benchmarks in ELA and math and the  fact that so many of our students reach Level 4 or 5 on the NYSESLAT, we believe that our program is successful.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Assistant principals meet with teachers on the grades they supervise to track children performing below grade level and  support the teacher.  We have an RTI process where children can receive additional support as needed.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   In our school we are able to give ENL students who score below proficiency levels and/or are progressing atypically supportive  services.   We take into consideration the years of ENL instruction, English and home literacy levels, emotional development  and parent requests or teacher concerns in order to develop additional support for these students. After  students have been  given the support the  school looks closely to develop more mandated support if needed. Given the fact that ELL are not a  monolithic group we look carefully at all contributing factors that can be altered in order to support  English development and  academic success.  Students in this position may be in other RTI groups that are working on specific skills with a  focus the child  may need to become more successful and  track their growth through student work . If after receiving RTI and ELL services it is  determined that a student would benefit from the additional mandated support of Special Education services, parents are  contacted and if in agreement a special education referral is initiated.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Given the small population in our school it is easy to  analyze the existing data and discover trends. The data reveals that we  have the highest number of students reach commanding level in the lower grades. We have few students who remain in the  English program in the upper grades unless they  began school  in  the U.S. in upper grades. Our outliers are generally students  with special needs and have been identified as have special needs and are receiving  support in both ENL and related  services.  We have also found that many of the students in our school begin in kindergarten multilingual but do not require  ENL services.  In these cases parents are fluent in many languages as well as children. Generally, most of our recently enrolled  student that are given the NYSITEL and require services perform at the entering  or emerging levels on the NYSITELL. However  we do have students that are beginning in school with instruction in English from there native country and or parents.           7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Meetings between classroom teachers and ENL teachr.              Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   In our freestanding ENL program students are grouped by grade at times and at other times by proficiency  level.  All  of the students that are newcomers or at the beginning level receive 180 minutes of Stand alone ENL in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71         order to develop language skills necesssary to access what is happening in the classroom. The other 180 minutes are  given as integrated ENL as a support to developing a better understanding of content within the curriculum.  In order  to  meet the needs of our as they become more sufficient as per CR 154  we deliver instruction aligned to support the  curriculum in their classroom. While students skills are emerging we support them with 90 minutes of standalone ENL  and then as skills progress we move to the more integrated support of ENL that is aligned to support student in  developing academic language skills that support content area within the classroom.     b.

How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              In order to meet the mandates of the students  they are given an array of support both in homogeneous grouping that  focus on targeting skills that enable access to the curriculum and then support in integrated groups that allow them to develop  proficiency in grade level content area assignments. The current ESL teacher would coordinate scheduling to assure the  mandates are met and appropriate support is given for these students. Students at the Entering level are given are given 360  minutes of ESL support, 180 in stand alone ENL instruction and the other 180 in itegrated groups to support ELA and/or math  progress.  Emerging is given less stad alone ( 90 minutes and then the rest is integrated ENL. Intermediate and advanced  (  Transitioning/ Expanding) are given 180 minutes of instruction in itegrated ENL. Our commanding students are added to other  integrated groups to support the transition to independent work.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Core content is given in a variety of methods.  All instruction is given in English but native language support is given when  needed. At times it makes most  sense to pull a small groups of ENL from a single grade to work on a writing project where the  teacher may brainstorm vocabulary, use a graphic organizer to show the structure of a the essay and or encourage and teach  use of translation dictionaries and or technology to support vocabulary in writing. At other times the support may rest on  building foundational skills needed to reach common core expectations. For example, students may need to learn the alphabet  and corresponding sounds in order to begin  to  be  develop skills that will allow them to access the readings on their grade  level.  Push in and pull out models are used based on the needs of the students. Depending on the teaching objective they may  use TPR ( Total Physical Response), collaborative or cooperative projects, language experience approaches and or Cognitive  academic learning approaches. In general the school philosophy is one that supports direct experiences as  a way to construct  ideas and is language rich in all areas. This presents great opportunities for  our ENL students .       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?       In most cases in our school the children are  living in bi - or multilinguagl homes. Parents are continuing to teach these  children in selected  academic areas in their native language. In the area surrounding the school many students continue to  take classes in native languages as well.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. For SIFE students it is important that we address the underlying splintered skills as well as developing new English language  skills. In these cases SIFE students may require more support throughout the day . This means that on top of ENL services the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72      student would require support to catch them up to current grade level.   b. Newcomers will be given 180 minutes of ENL standalone services in order to develop basic language skills along with 180  minutes in order to develop common core skills. Because newcomers are working on basic language skills it is generally a pull  out service. At times it can be push in to support aclimation to the classrooom work.    c. Developing ELL's have mastered many of the basic skills we continue to provide instruction enabling them to  develop  deeper understandings of langauge as well as scaffolding support to meet the common core standards in all content  areas. These support are push in or pull out based on the proficiency task.   d. In our school we are fortunate to have very few , if any, long term ELL's. In these rare instances ELL student are usually  identified as SWD as well. These students are given both ENL support services along with special education service in order to  develop strategies tha ensure their academic progress.  e. Former ELLS are given continued support as needed and are still given testing accommodations. These students require  Integrated ENL and are supported to transition to independence.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All ELL- SWD are working in grade level materials when appropriate. In many cases they need support to complete assignments  and are developing  specific strategies to increase vocabulary and word attack, problem solving and computation skills as well  as the use of graphic organizers, brainstorming vocabulary and structure  and grammar in writing assignments. They are  receiving all related mandated services.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Most ELL-SWD are placed in a Collaborative teaching classroom and receive the support services in ESL and within the ICT  classroom. This minimizes time out of the classroom. In cases where students have been places in general education  calssrooms the ESL and SETTS teacher meet periodically in order to ensure the student is progressing or adjust the services to  meet his/her needs.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  We use a variety of targeted interventions.  Students are in LLI groups to address ELA needs and in some cases student are part  of a Wilson reading group to address word attack skills and fluency.  More recently  a strong focus on math has generated  smaller learning groups to address specific concepts for ELLs., for example small group afterschool instruction that targets  fractions.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      This year as a school we are looking carefully at how to improve our math curriculum by differentiating for ELLs and other  students. This means looking care fully at langauge and learning objectives to support ELL students in developing concepts and  comprehension surrounding mathematics.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELL students are invited to all afterschool prgrams in our school. In some instances the programs are developing the native  language or are enrichment programs in art, music, computer, etc.  We also offer programs that are designed specifically for  the ELL population giving them first priority and access to our Title III before and after school programs.         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73         Throughout the year ELLs are encouraged to become increasingly independent. They are encouraged to read in their native  language and taught how to use the computer to loosely translate as well as use dictionaries and thesauruses in order to grow  linguistically. When possible, books in both English and native languages are used. For example some children's book are  printed in both Swedish and English allowing the child access from two languages. In other instances it makes most sense to  follow a particular program, such as LLI,  to ensure students are gaining appropriate sight words and comprehension. :        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   At this point our school only has ENL program. Support in home language is given through dictionaries, computer programs  and support of staff members and former ELL students.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    In order to make sure all required support and services correspond to ELLs grade level, many grouping are based by grade.  All  of the teachers are very familiar with the Common Core standards on their grade and their instruction is CCS aligned.  Although  we have high standards for all students, we know that it is important to differentiate so that all students have access.   We  have used UDL structures to help ensure that this happens.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Throughout the year ELLs are encouraged to become increasingly independent. They are encouraged to read in their native  language and taught how to use the computer to loosely translate as well as use dictionaries and thesauruses in order to grow  linguistically. When possible, books in both English and native languages are used. For example some childrens book are  printed in both swedish and English allowing the child access from two languages. In other instances it makes most sesne to  follow a program  ( LLI) to ensure students are gaining appropriate sight wordds and comprehension. :        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Along with the parent orientation our school sets up buddy systems with  former ELL students and newcomers that enable  them to support the newer students in their home lanagugea. We also have an international parent breakfast in order to  connect newer families to families that have transitioned previously.         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   ELL teachers participate in Monday PD focused on literacy, including meeting the needs of ELL students.  There are different  cycles of PD that are customized based on the needs of the teachers in the group.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74         Much of our Monday PD time focuses on differentiating teaching to help students meeting the CCLS.  For example, teachers  might participate in a multi-session math inquiry cycle focused on differentiation to meet the needs of children who struggle in  mathematics, including ELL students.  In addition, cycles of professional development with staff developers from Teachers  College Reading and Writing Project focus on working with children who struggle with language/vocabuloary.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  This happens through Monday PD, PD with outside consultants in literacy and math, and grade-based PD that happens during  the school day.  The principal keeps records of the PD.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In order to keep parents abreast of the child's learning they are invited to curriculum conferences with the classroom teacher  and also with the ENL teacher.  Two international parent breakfast meetings are held to discuss school related issues. The ENL  teacher is available by email and throughout the  year  meets with parents to  continue to support the families with ideas for  home language support and/or enrichment activities in the surrounding areas.  In addition, there are monthly parent  workshops or Family Nights such as Family Math Night, Family Arts Night, Green and Healthy Night, and more.   In addition,  teachers schedule an additional individual meeting with each ELL family to which the ELL teacher and any RTI teachers involved  are invited.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  In general  parent involvement in our school is encouraged. International parents are encouraged to volunteer during lunch or  in the yard. The PTA has a liaison who reaches out to the International parent group in order to inform them of the many ways  they can assist at the school. These include evening activities as well as volunteering on committees in the PTA.  The parent  coordinator, PTA co-presidents and the principal collaborate to develop different volunteer opportunities for parents. Teachers  also allow parents the opportunity to volunteer in the classroom. In many cases newer ESL parents will volunteer in lunch or  recess to support their children socializing.  In addition, there are monthly parent workshops or Family Nights such as Family  Math Night, Family Arts Night, Green and Healthy Night and more.  Our "Family Fridays," scheduled the first Friday of every  month, are a wonderful opportunity for parents of ELLs to gain a better understanding of what is happening in the  classroom.  During these times, parents come into the classrooms to do an activity with students, which might be reading,  social studies, playing math games, doing art together, etc.  The parent coordinator sends out a weekly e-bulletin that most of  our families, including ELL families, subscribe to so she helps keep parents informed this way.  In addition, she is available to  meet with parents as needed and is knowledgeable about how to access translation services.              Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.                 2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75                   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Elizabeth Phillips, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The school uses the contact cards and part III of the HLS to determine the language used for communication. We  then access either translation or interpretation services to translate letters, flyers or parent notifications, if they  are not available in the langauge requested. Based on the contact cards and HLS we will create a report with the  languages that parents speak, by grade and class.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79      Language    Written  Preferred    Percent  Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    Although we do have a small percentage  of parents that have primarly languages  other than English most parents request  information in English. Parents request  information in Spanish, French and  Arabic. We have school staff that is able  to translate in each of these languages  in order to communicate with these  families.                        3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.               Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      Document Name    Month/Frequency   How do you   Distributed to   plan to   Families    translate?   Include   procedures  to ensure   timely   provision of  translated  documents  to parents.    In our school the important annoucements are given out in English  unless otherwise indicated. If the student/family has requested  communication in spanish, French or Arabic the document is  translated within the school or translation / interpretation services  are rendered.                  2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as   parent-teacher   conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80      Meeting Name    Month/Frequency   of Meetings    How does  your school   In parent teacher conferences, meeting with the guidance counselor  or curriculum nights translation is available for these parents.  Professionals within the school are familiar with the individuals who  are fluent in these languages and call for assistance when necessary.               plan to  provide   interpretation   service(s)?       3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.
