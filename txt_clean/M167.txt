This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      At Wagner Middle School, our educational philosophy is based upon an alignment to the national Common Core  Learning Standards. Students learn best when their teachers are differentiating instruction based on student learning  styles, needs, and abilities. This is evident through data based groupings, accommodations for student products and  outcomes, and adjustments to learning processes. During lessons, teachers engage in a pedagogical approach   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      centered on student inquiry, deep questioning, and various modes of discussion. Our curriculum is organized by  content-based units of study, with essential questions tying individual lessons to a larger, overarching theme.                        2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Robert F. Wagner Middle School serves approximately 1,400 students from diverse populations.

Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We will continue our work around data by focusing our data conversations around instructional next steps at the  lesson plan level to impact student achievement, giving special consideration to our special populations, including  students with disabilities and English Language Learners.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The Elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which we made the most progress for the 2016 - 2017 school  year were Strong Family-Community Ties and Supportive Environment.       In the 2018 - 2019 school year, we are going to continue to work on Supportive Environment and Strong Family- Community Ties and add Rigorous Environment. Our work around Rigorous Instruction will focus on the  implementation and monitoring of a revised school-wide grading policy to increase alignment between classroom  grades and standards aligned assessments, with an increased focus on support of our students who most struggle  academically, including students with disabilities and English language learners . Our work around Strong Family and  Community Ties will include creating additional opportunities for increased parent involvement in our school  community. Our work around Supportive Environment will include the expanded implementation of restorative circles  during weekly advisory.                 2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 02M167   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1336   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     A review of student data has also indicated discrepancies between student performance on standardized assessments  (i.e., NYS exams in ELA and Math) and class grades. Student data from F&P reading levels and school-designed  common performance assessments indicate that after initial gains, in recent years, student performance has  plateaued, particularly among our SWDs and ENLs. We believe that an increased focus on the performance of our  students who most struggle academically is necessary in order to ensure that these students will be ready for high  school, college, and career.       During the 2016 - 2017 school year, all departments established shared practices for grading that include select,  agreed upon summative, formative, class work and homework tasks for all students including SWDs and ENLS. In  reviewing grading data for students, we noticed that students in the same content areas in the same grade were not  obtaining grades that indicated their performance against the standards. In the 2016-2017 school year, we provided  all departments with the same percentages for each grading category. During the 2017-2018 school year, we  implemented a school-wide policy to guide each department's grading and assessment and establish school-wide  expectations for late work and a common work habits rubric. In the 2017-18 grading policy, departments selected  their own percentages, as we believed this would lead to greater accuracy of grades in reflecting performance against  the standards. However, we found that the variety of grading categories and percentages used across departments  created confusion among students and families. Furthermore, we noted discrepancies in standards-aligned and  completion-based grading practices within and across departments; such discrepancies interfered with the ability of  students' grades to clearly and accurately reflect performance against the standards in all classes.    A review of school-wide grade data, a review of discrepancies between classroom grades and standards based  assessments, feedback from teacher feedback sessions in each department, as well as feedback from students and  families were used to guide the revisions for both the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 grading policies.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  In order to develop our supportive environment goal, we reviewed our school survey, suspension, attendance, and  achievement data to determine ways to meet the needs of our school. Our school survey data indicates that students  would welcome the opportunity to be involved in giving feedback in the school culture at Wagner Middle School.  Additionally, students would benefit from opportunities to work on social skills such as listening, problem solving, and  communication.       During the school year 2016-2017, 6th grade staff implemented restorative circles during one period per week in 6th  grade advisory. Teachers also participated in a Restorative Practices study group this school year. Based on survey  data, students felt a greater sense of belonging and a greater number of adults to seek support from. Students were  more collaborative, able to solve problems, and able to communicate to support each other in the classroom. Teacher  feedback was also shared that advisory groups should be smaller to support implementation of curriculum. During  school year 2017-18, restorative circles were expanded to include students in grades 7 and 8 in weekly advisory  sessions. Teacher feedback noted that this had a positive impact on the school community.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Robert F. Wagner Middle School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Wagner Middle School will support parents and families of Title I students by:        providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37         The school’s Parent Involvement      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.          In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing  technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;     maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;         provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State   accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;     host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise   parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right  to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118  and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);  schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the  Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;               The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement           holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;    hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school   year;     encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-  Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  supporting or hosting Family Day events;       establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;    encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;    providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their   children’s progress;     developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about   school activities and student progress;     providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a   format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand            School-Parent Compact (SPC)   School-Parent Compact (SPC)         Robert F Wagner Middle School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds  Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student  achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and  programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will  share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be  developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.       For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and  Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Two teachers will be working for all 35 Thursday after- school sessions and 3 Saturday sessions.  Based on our NYS ELA Exam scores only 14% of  ELLS and 40% of F-ELLS are proficient as compared with 70% of non-ELLS. We want to  provide additional support for students in the four modalities in order to aid their language  acquisition and support their mastery of skills to gain proficiency on the NYS ELA Exam.     Thursday After School Sessions:   9/20/18, 10/4/18, 10/11/18, 10/18/18, 10/25/18, 11/1/18, 11/15/18, 11/29/18, 12/6/18, 12/13/18,  12/20/18, <!--{cke_protected}%3Cmeta%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%20%2F%3E-->1/3/19,  1/10 /19, 1/17 /19, 1/24/19, 1/31 /19, 2/7/19, 2/14/19, 2/28/19, 3/7/19, 3/14/19, 3/21/19 and  3/28/19, or  1/18, 4/11/19, 4/25/19, 5/2/19, 5/9/19, 5/16/19, 5/23/19, 5/30/19, 6/6/19, 6/13/19 and  6/20/19  Classes are taught in English and will meet from 2:40-4:40  in our ENL and/or ENL/ELA  classroom on Thursdays.  Approximately 25-30 ELLS and F-ELLs across grade 6, 7, and 8 will  attend this program.  The students will receive instruction in grade specific groupings with no  more than 2 contiguous grades in the class. This group will include entering, emerging,  transitional, and expanding students with a variety of home languages. This group will include  subgroups of students such as long term ELLs, SIFE, and newcomers.  We hope to group  students based on NYSESLAT and/or ELA levels.  During this Title III after-school program,  the students will receive small-group ENL/ELA  instruction using a curriculum supporting the four modalities of language acquisition (listening,  speaking, reading, and writing).  The General Education teacher   and ENL teacher will co-plan  lessons in order to facilitate small group instruction, model reading and writing strategies, and  model proficient discussion partners.  The ENL teacher and General Education teacher teacher  will determine specific language and content objectives for each session and utilize small group  instruction, team teaching, and parallel teaching to meet the student needs in heterogeneous and  homogeneous groupings. Students will also utilize Ipads  to access complex text, take notes on  complex texts, and use enhanced digital features to enhance and amplify content  and vocabulary  for better understanding. The teacher of this program is an ENL/ELA certified teacher.  There  will also be a General Education teacher supporting this activity.  Students will be led in a  Reading/Writing-centered curriculum, through the lens of studying New York City's rich cultural  and historical neighborhoods.  Students will learn about various neighborhoods through the  unique histories and cultures they represent. They will access prior knowledge by using  their  home country's cities as a comparison.  This English program (with minor support in Spanish  and Chinese from our ENL teacher) will enhance their English acquisition and focus specifically  on Wagner’s goal of improving ELLs/Former ELLs academic language acquisition.

Additionally, this topic will help students explore their cultural identity and build community to  learn about one another and their new home.  During the Title III after school program, students will create a culminating digital NYC  guidebook based on the neighborhoods, food, and cultural institutions studies and visited.  Students may draw comparisons and express their preferences among these neighborhoods and  their home countries. Students will present these books at a culminating celebration  and group  presentation. Students will also have the opportunity to create their own coming to America  stories using bare books and mentor texts as guides.   Saturday Sessions:  Saturday, 3/1, 3/8, 3/15 from 9:00-3:00.  During the Title III Saturday programming, we will provide three, six-hour Saturday sessions to  extend the experiential learning aspect of our Title III after school program during the month of  March for trips to various NYC landmarks including the Tenement Museum, Ellis Island, the  Lower East Side Immigrant Heritage Trail, and  the Museum of Chinese in America.  These trips  will support students in multi-media understandings of immigration and experiential  opportunities to deepen their understanding of immigration.   The materials purchased for the program are included below:  Reading A-Z subscription will be purchased to supplement fiction immigration readings.   15 head phones with microphone  for listening to audio books to support student access to texts  on immigration.  30 bare books for planning and development of books for culminating project.

During these meetings, the ENL teacher  participates with content teachers to address the NEW Language Arts Progressions in their  instructional approach by focusing on the guiding principles that 1. Students develop language  proficiency in listening, speaking, reading, and writing interdependently, but at different rates  and in different ways and 2. Students’ development of academic language and academic content  knowledge are inter-related processes.  To further this investigation and application of ENL  support in the content areas,  teachers will  read excerpts from "Building Academic Language"  by Jeff Zweirs.  Through these professional readings the teachers in the study group hope to  bring the focus of teaching academic language in the content areas to the forefront of our work  with our ELLs/Former ELLs.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We currently assess early literacy skills of our ELLs using Fountas and Pinnell running records.  This assessment indicates that  many of our beginning ELLs are struggling with development of phonics skills in English.    Additionally, our ELLs and former ELLs are still not reading at grade level according to our assessments.  Although they might  be able to decode the words in the texts, as the texts become more complex they are struggling to understand non-context  embedded vocabulary that is crucial to understanding. This data will inform our school's instructional program in a few  ways.  We will have our beginning ELLs receive stand alone ESL services with direct, multi-sensory phonics instruction.  Additionally, we will target vocabulary development among all of our ELLs through push-in services where students are  explicitly taught content vocabulary embedded in context.   Vocabulary development will also focus  on Tier II words with an  emphasis on function words and complex sentence structures that students meet in text.  The strategy of  deconstruct/reconstruct will be employed to enable students to comprehend informational text.  In addition to building   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      vocabulary, ELLs will also be explicitly taught how to determine word meaning to build understanding through differentiated  word study. ELLs will have their reading levels periodically assessed at least three times per year to monitor their progress on  early literacy skills.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   ENL students are clustered in certain classes to allow the ENL teacher to address areas of need according to the assessments.  This allows our schedule for our ENL providers who are also certified in ELA to include integrated ENL in the Social sStudies and  English Language Arts classroom. This provide students with content embedded vocabulary instruction on all  grades.  Additionally, we have organized curricular materials to support reading growth, such as Moby Max, Scholastic Short  Reads, and Scholastic Guided Reading sets.  During Stand Alone periods, ENL providers use  station based instruction  incorporating small group instruction, computer based instruction, and independent reading and writing tasks to support  growth in literacy levels as evidenced by Fountas and Pinnell assessments. Data from Fountas and Pinnell are shared and  disseminated using a google doc and reviewed during weekly grade level meetings and CPTs when instructional decisions are  made collaboratively.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our ELL programs by meeting AYP for ELLs, making progress on local measures such as Fountas and  Pinnell Running Records and School-Wide Content Based Performance Assessments.  We also review our unit level  assessments and projects to determine how our ELLs are performing in comparison with their peers.  We track this on a school  wide spreadsheet which records student progress on these assessments and ensure that our ELLs are identified on that  sheet.  Areas of need according to these data are in  areas of reading complex texts and writing complex sentences and  essays.  Additionally, we evaluate the efficacy of the program by reviewing our NYSESLAT pass rate.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    After the summative data has been gathered, ENL teachers in collaboration with general education teachers determine  curricular interventions and next steps to implement with students during CPT meetings and Department meetings.   Student  progress is monitored weekly to assess progress in areas of strength and weakness as evidenced in provider notes and  formative assessments. Information regarding interventions for Ells are shared during weekly CPT meetings and a Google docs  spreadsheet.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Not Applicable      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Performance on the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT show that the majority of our students are at the Transitioning-  Commanding levels. However, our 8th grade has the highest number ELLs in general with the greatest number of Entering and  Emerging students.  As students move up the grades, the number of ELLs is decreasing because of students becoming  proficient on the NYSESLAT. Based on these scores, students are provided the appropriate units of study  in accordance with  CR Part 154.2 for ENL programming. Additionally we have a sub group of long term ells who are scoring at a level 1 or 2 on  the NYSELAT  test. This indicates that we should be aligning our instructional resources to target this particular population.           7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teachers work collaboratively with the administration to find the most appropriate setting for each child. Ells are, for  the most part, clustered together to make scheduling and instruction more purposeful. We have department data meetings  each trimester to disseminate data and make adjustments.  We also review outcome assessments at the start of the school  year with all teachers to determine curricular and instructional supports for all students.  We use this data to align pedagogical   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         and curricular resources through collaborative planning time. Adjustments are made in collaboration among the ENL provider  and the content teacher. These adjustment are made  every trimester.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   WE USE A COMBINATION OF STANDALONE ENL AND INTEGRATED ENL TO SUPPORT OUR ELLS AT WAGNER.  IN 6TH  GRADE OUR STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED IN A VARIETY OF GENERAL EDUCATION CLASSES.  ALL STUDENTS ARE  GROUPED HETEROGENEOUSLY IN GENERAL EDUCATION CLASSES. THE ENTERING AND EMERGING 6TH GRADE  STUDENTS ARE SEEN 8 TIMES PER WEEK (FOUR TIMES A WEEK INSTRUCTION IS STAND ALONE AND FOUR TIMES THE  INSTRUCTION IS INTEGRATED IN SOCIAL STUDIES) AND ARE PREDOMINATELY IN ONE CLASS. 6TH GRADE  TRANSITIONAL AND EXPANDING ELLS ARE SERVICED THOUGH INTEGRATED ENL BY MS. NEVINS, WHO IS DUALLY  CERTIFIED IN ELA AND ESL.    7TH AND 8TH GRADE STUDENTS ALSO RECEIVE A COMBINATION OF SERVICES  INCLUDING STAND ALONE ENL AND INTEGRATED ENL IN SOCIAL STUDIES CLASS DEPENDING ON THEIR PROFICIENCY  LEVEL BY MS.

If applicable.     Not Applicable   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not Applicable      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Students' mandated services are identified by reviewing achievement data on the RLAT  report.  The ENL teachers reviews  their  schedule with the administration and plan a program that meets all mandates.   We have four ENL certified teachers  providing ENL services to our students. This allows us to satisfy the mandated number of minutes for both Integrated ENL and  Stand Alone ENL for all levels of proficiency as per CR Part 154. Additionally, we ensure that our students are receiving a  minimum of 180 minutes of ELA instruction by arranging for ENL providers who are dually licensed to also teach  ELA classes  on 7th and 8th grade and ensuring that STANDALONE  services taking place during ELA periods still allow for students to receive 180 Minutes of ELA instruction.  Additionally, ENL  providers push into Social Studies classes to provide Integrated ENL services.  Former Ells receive the required 90 minutes of  Integrated ENL through either small group learning or Integrated ENL with a certified ENL teacher .           3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      The content area instruction is delivered to allow multiple points of access to the content through text, visuals, scaffolded   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      supports, and talk.   Rather than providing modified content, we provide enhanced content.  Students are exposed to concepts  through multiple modalities.  Students are provided with explicit instruction in how to develop an argument to support their  idea using text evidence.  This protocol is repeated throughout the content areas to provide consistent strategies and repeated  practice.  Additionally, students are seated heterogeneously during classroom instruction to facilitate discussion using peer  models.  Throughout our content area classrooms, ELLs are provided with language supports such as sentence starters and the  opportunity to have discussion with direct teacher feedback in the moment. In addition to direct collaboration with content  are teachers, our ENL teachers, Ms. Nevins, MS. Walsh, Ms. Wittenstein, and Ms. Gray provide support in developing  background knowledge through read-alouds, use of multimedia for content explanation and pre-work to prepare for  classroom discussions. Students use native language supports such as texts in their native language, connection of content  area vocabulary to native language vocabulary, and conversations in native language to prepare to discuss in English.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      In order to appropriately evaluate all students in their native language, we ensure that all state exams are ordered in  students' native language when available.  We also hire translators for low-incidence languages for. We also assess all native  Spanish speakers by using the Spanish LAB when they enroll.  Additionally, we allow students to complete tasks in their native  language where appropriate and according to the New Language Arts Progressions.  Where possible students are provided  with content based glossaries supplied by NYS and the use of dictionaries on all assessments. Additionally, bilingual staff aid in  assessing student's language when applicable.         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Wagner Middle School differentiates based on ELL subgroups as necessary.  Newcomers are placed together whenever  possible to ensure comfort in speaking (both native language and English). We have a very small number of SIFE students,  which allows us to arrange individualized supports (i.e.; placement in ICT classes, assigning to a smaller grouping for AIS with  specific staff, and/or meeting ENL needs through an Integrated or Stand Alone model depending on student's needs). SIFE and  beginner students are also supported with explicit, direct instruction in learning beginning literacy skills.         Long term ELLs benefit from all teaching practices within ENL.  Our Title III program offers all ELLs the opportunity to engage  in interdisciplinary work that supports their development of both content knowledge and skills in the four modalities through  field trips, non fiction reading, and developing presentations to share their new knowledge with staff and family  members.  Many of our long-term ELLs are students with disabilities.  Students with disabilities receive all benefits of Wagner’s  extensive ENL program and teaching as well as their IEP modifications and extensions.  The ENL teachers collaborate closely  with the special service providers to ensure the students are receiving appropriate language acquisition supports.       This year we have continued the implementation of our Integrated ENL model in 6  th  , 7  th  ,  and 8th grade which allows the  ENL teacher to team teach and plan with a content area teacher.  Included in these co-taught classes are DEVELOPING, LONG  TERM AND FORMER ELLs as well.  We continue to see the benefits of not pulling these students out eight times a week, but  instead infusing their ENL needed-skills in their already present ELA and Social Studies lessons.  Teachers collaborate to  ensure content and language objectives are clear and strategies such as using the frayer model for vocabulary enhancement,  are utilized appropriately.     Our former ELLs continue to receive  support for their academic and linguistic development through small group learning and Integrated ENL for  HALF A UNIT OF  STUDY PER WEEK.  The ENL providers also closely collaborate with the content area teachers in all areas to develop  appropriate supports for former ELLs.   ALL ELLS AND FORMER ELLS ARE ENTITLED TO TESTING ACCOMMODATIONS OF EXTENDED TIME, USE OF DICTIONARIES AND   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      GLOSSARIES, AND TESTS IN NATIVE LANGUAGE OR THE USE OF A TRANSLATOR ON EXAMS.  ACCOMMODATIONS ARE  FACILITATED BY ENL PROVIDERS, MS. NEVINS, MS. Walsh, Ms. Wittenstein and MS. Gray AND OVERSEEN BY THE ENL  ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL, MS. DELANEY.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our teachers of ELL-SWDs work closely with the ENL provider as well as all providers to meet both the language acquisition  needs and special needs of their students.  Our ELL-SWDs receive weekly small group instruction focused on modelling use of  academic language to describe understanding of text at their individual reading levels.  ELL-SWDs are provided with vocabulary  supports, visuals, modelling, and structured graphic organizers to improve written and oral response, as well as understanding  of grade level text.  ELL-SWDs are also provided with access to content via the use of technology such as iPads. The iPad can be  used to enhance access to grade-level text through visuals, read aloud features, word look up features, native language  translation, and annotation support.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  We regularly assess the strengths and weaknesses of our ELL-SWDs to provide them with pull-out and push in services in the  least restrictive environment.  The majority of our ELL-SWDs are serviced in our ICT classrooms, which is the most appropriate  setting at this time.  ELL-SWDs are provided with services as per their IEPs.  Students are provided with ICT services based on  their response to intervention and qualification for special education services through the special education evaluation  process. We also provide flexible scheduling in all of our grades to allow students to receive services across the continuum in  math and ELA. We also work to include our ELL-SWDs in all ELL programming including Title III.  Where possible, we work to  have our ELL-SWDs serviced by a dually certified provider in ENL and Special Education.  However, where this is not possible,  our ENL providers collaborate with the special education teacher to ensure appropriate delivery of services.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our interventions are provided to ensure our students are successful in all areas of need.  Interventions are provided in Math  and ELA through at-risk services, in the classroom supports and through Saturday Academies.  As a classroom support,  ELLs  receive small group reading instruction using a multi-sensory phonics program.  Additionally, ELLs are supported by using  a leveled library and tiered materials. Ells receive small group reading and writing intervention through our ELA curriculum that  includes additional independent reading time, individual comprehension conferences, writing about reading using text  evidence, and rubrics based teacher feedback about reading and writing. The ENL teacher in collaboration with the content  teacher use scaffolding strategies in planning for instruction     In our classrooms, ELLs are targeted for weekly small group instruction in ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies based on  teacher data. Saturday Academy is focused on developing math and literacy skills in alignment with the Common Core State  Standards.  All ELLs are eligible based on test scores and teacher nomination.  Finally, during the school day, ELLs that are  evaluated by our pupil personell team are eligible to receive at risk services from a special education service provider, speech  provider, counselor, or occupational therapist.  These services are currently provided in English, but we are able to get services  for students in native languages based on IEP mandates. These may be push-in or pull-out services as part of an intervention  plan. All of these intervention services are in addition to the curriculum embedded supports already in place for ELLs.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We spent the 2017- 2018 school year  creating and implementing  a strategic, ENL class for newcomers that targets literacy  needs based on school data.  We are working to develop this program as our newcomer population is increasing year after  year and this is our population with the biggest needs.    Additionally, we are continuing to develop our push-in curriculum in Social Studies and hope to include co-teaching in the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      other content areas for the 2018-2019 school year based on requests through informal teacher feedback and review of  student performance in the content areas.  In collaboration with our general education colleagues, we also hope to develop a  research-based approach to supporting Former ELLs in a way that enhances their curriculum access and achievement during  the 2018-2019 school year.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None at this time.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All students, including ELLs have access to attending our after school programs.  Our after school program includes a wide  range of athletic, artistic, and academic programs.  Some current after school programs are dissection club, math counts, mock  trial, and intramural ping pong.  Notices for upcoming programs are posted on our website, which is translatable into many  languages.  Additionally, there are scholarships provided for these programs.  ELLs also have access to all of our enrichment  programs when qualified, such as honors math and honors science: Finally, all ELLs are able to take advantage of our band  program and all grade level field trips and opportunities.  Our Title III program provides an after school opportunity to develop  skills in the four modalities through an interdisciplinary project.  For example, the project for the 2018-19 year will be to study  the cultures and foods of NYC.  STUDENTS USED IPADS TO READ ABOUT THESE TOPICS, CREATED RECIPES AND COOKED,  EXPLAINING THEIR DISHES AND HISTORY. Students go on Saturday field trips to explore and learn about the neighborhoods  and rich  history of their new home.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We utilize smartboards in all classrooms to provide visuals, multi-media representations of content, and models for students  during instruction.  We also utilize iPads to provide language based centers and support development of literacy skills for  newcomers. Voice thread is used to support students oral language development on the ipads.  Additionally, students are  provided with graphic organizers, accountable talk supports, and small group instruction. We have developed a guided reading  library that includes non-fiction and fiction texts at a variety of levels.  Our classroom libraries also includes high interests low  level texts for middle schoolers that deal with engaging topics from Rhino and Capstone publishers. Our libraries have  a few  texts in the variety of languages in our school community.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We have texts and dictionaries available for students in their native language in several content areas.  All teachers are  provided with content relevant glossaries to use with students in their classrooms.  Additionally, ELLs have access to iPads,  which provide a variety of options for providing instruction in native language. Spanish speaking Ells are assessed upon entry  into a NYC school with the Spanish Lab. Students who share a home language are grouped together when possible for added  support.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All ELLs have equal access to appropriate services, supports, and resources. We have aligned an ENL provider with each grade  level to ensure that students are serviced with their age-appropriate peers regardless of proficiency level. Materials are  modified or leveled to make them accessible to Ells at each proficiency level. Working with the core subject teachers, the ENL  teacher delivers the necessary strategies students need in order to be successful in the content areas.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We utilize smartboards in all classrooms to provide visuals, multi-media representations of content, and models for students  during instruction.  We also utilize iPads to provide language based centers and support development of literacy skills for   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         newcomers. Additionally, students are provided with graphic organizers, accountable talk supports, and small group  instruction. We have developed a guided reading library that includes non-fiction and fiction texts at a variety of levels.  Our  classroom libraries also include a few texts in the variety of languages in our school community.         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   The school invites the families of all new ELL students  to come in for an orientation with the ENL teachers in September.  This  orientation covers the school's expectations, ENL programming at Wagner, special activities and grade level focuses.  Parents are shown how to navigate the Wagner website and pupil path.  New students are also paired with  a buddy to help  them in their new school environment. This partnership ensures that the new student receives important  information on a  peer-level as well. When possible the student buddy speaks the same home language or is a current or former Ell them selves.  The ENL teacher  offers entering and emerging ELLs a  pull out group where beginning language skills are taught in addition to  the skills of being a new student in a new school.  For example, ENL teachers provided school tours to our new ELLs to help  them get acquainted with our school building and important places to know.  Additionally,  ENL teachers provided scaffolded  supports for learning crucial English at the beginning of the year, such as, May I go to the bathroom?  Additionally our Parent  Coordinator communicates with newly arrived families through out the year and aids the ENL teacher in finding buddies for  the new student.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not Applicable        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Ms. Nevins, Ms. Walsh, Ms. Wittenstein, and Ms. Gray, our ENL teachers, receive multiple Professional Development  Opportunities through the Office of ELLs as well as other professional organizations.  The ENL providers currently attend  Wagner ELA and Social Studies department meetings in order to provide colleagues with support in developing units, tasks,  and lessons that provide supports for ELLs.  This structure also allows the ENL providers to infuse the Common Core Standards  into her curricular planning. The hope is that this infusion offered our students a smoother transition between ESL and ELA  through common language and common curriculum used.      Our ENL teachers meet weekly on Mondays  from 2:45-4:00.  During this time, they examine professional texts, debrief  intervisitations, develop shared planning practices, and reflect on next steps for instruction.  Every month, ENL teachers meet with ELL consultant, Ms. Pallen, to determine shared instructional practices and evaluate  efficacy of current compliance and instructional organization to best serve students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      WAGNER HAS A MONTHLY GRADE LEVEL MEETING WITH TEACHERS OF ELLS ACROSS THE CONTENT AREAS.  DURING THIS  PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TEACHERS LEARN ENL STRATEGIES AND METHODOLOGIES TO INCORPORATE INTO THEIR  LESSON PLANNING.  TEACHERS ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE ACADEMIC LANGUAGE NECESSARY FOR  SUCCESS IN THEIR CONTENT AND CREATE ACCESS POINTS FOR ENL STUDENTS. TEACHERS FOLLOW A PROTOCOL FOR  SUPPORTING ELL STUDENTS AND THROUGH INTERVISTATIONS SHARE BEST PRACTICES AND NEXT STEPS.  WE USE  ZWEIRS  BUILDING ACADEMIC LANGUAGE AS A TOUCH STONE TEXT TO GUIDE OUR LEARNING AND GROWTH.  ADDITIONALLY,  TEACHERS ARE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE AS OUTSIDE ELL WORKSHOPS BECOME AVAILABLE THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF  ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS.      Our ENL provider will continue to attend the Advance Literacy PD through the Manhattan Field Support Center. The  following dates are TBD.   During these dates the instructional focus is on academic language, academic writing, and analytical practices.  This series will  use the lens of advanced literacy to explore instructional approaches that can help ELLs meet the demands of high level  academic performance tasks, from oral discussion, and reading comprehension to academic writing.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Ms. Nevins works in close collaboration with the staff to support student transition to Middle School by attending weekly  common planning time meetings with staff as needed.  She also works directly with students through pull out and push in  services to support with reading schedules, understanding how classes change, and developing the language skills to negotiate  the social environment of middle school. In addition, the majority of our 6th grade staff is certified K-6 Elementary, thus  offering many transitional supports.  Sixth graders are most often offered smaller classes, homeroom grouping, “house”  grouping, weekly advisory, proactive lessons and assemblies on topics such as organization, homework help, study skills,  bullying, library skills, etc. Our Guidance Counselors work with Ms. Nevins to determine approaches for students newly  enrolled and transitioning from elementary to middle school.        Ms. Nevins, Ms. Wittenstein, Ms. Walsh, and Ms. Gray are provided bi-weekly support from our ENL consultant, Ms.  Pallen.  She works on developing ENL curriculum and strategies for supporting newcomers and content access for all ELLs and  former ELLs. Ms. Pallen also works bi-weekly with Ms. Delaney, assistant principal, to develop long term goals and materials for  ELLs and Former ELLs at Wagner.       Secretaries at Wagner have been provided with the opportunity to attend PD for secretaries provided through the office of  ELLs.  The secretaries also work closely with the Assistant Principal of ELLs, Ms. Delaney to understand record keeping and  procedures for enrollment and language access at school. Guidance staff also meets regularly with Ms. Delaney to determine  trends for servicing ELLs and families of ELLs at Wagner through supporting transition and language access.     Wagner’s content area teachers are exposed to ELL needs and development through varying publications provided by our ENL  Teacher and ENL Assistant Principal.  Our ELL team also develops ongoing curriculum and lesson plans to turn key  differentiation opportunities across content areas to multiple content area teachers, which is most often turn keyed to staff  through coaches and team leaders during Department Meetings, Professional Learning Time, and weekly planning sessions  with Content area co-teachers of ELLs.  We will also continue turnkeying ELL specific strategies in cooperation with our SAT  (School Psychologist, Social Worker, Special Education AP and Special Education teachers).  Special Education teachers and  paraprofessionals also are introduced to student specific ELL needs and accommodations at CPT (Common Planning Time)  made possible in teachers’ schedules throughout the school year and once per week during parent engagement time; in  addition our Parent Coordinator is supporting with practices allowing for more communication with our ELL families by our  ENL AP and teachers. Records of his work are kept in google docs to track next steps, attendance, and agenda items.

Our continued work with ENL consultant, Ms. Pallen includes meeting with the staff  members teaching the largest volume of ELL/former ELL students and offering specific techniques.  This consultant will also  work with Ms. Nevins and her content area co-teachers to develop planning that best meets the needs of ELLs at Wagner.  These techniques will then be turn-keyed at grade level Department Meetings to allow other staff this knowledge as well.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Wagner benefits from a very active Parent Association and typically school wide events are well attended from our  parents.  Title III parent meetings and ESL Parent Teacher conferences in years past were attended by approximately 40% of  our ELL families, with nearly all families in touch with the ESL Provider  throughout the school year.    Wagner sends home report cards and/or progress reports 6 times throughout the school year – all of which are signed for and  returned.  Families in need of translated materials fill out an additional survey and their needs are met via phone call and/or  translated materials sent home.  Wagner also has an active website, where near-weekly communication is sent home and is  able to be translated on the webpage.  Students’ grades, attendance, and assessments are also able to be viewed online  through  system called Pupil Path.    When the DOE translation services are unable to meet our needs, we reach out to LIS translation services for support.  We also  have several ties to organization providing support specifically to our Asian families (ELLs and non ELLs) including past referrals  to APEX and the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center and most recently to Kumon Learning Center.    The majority of our communication and conversations with parents happen at Parent Teacher Conferences and ELL based  family meetings.  In years past, “surveys” are also sent home to gage interest and need on topics such as after school,  translation needs, support services, etc, as needed.  Due to the volume of family communication through email blast, website,  online grading system, email, and/or one-on-one phone calls we have found such surveys have not been necessary recently as  specific needs are able to be addressed quickly through the variety of communication options in place.  All school based  information is posed on our webpage, which translates itself in over 12 languages and whenever possible large scale (Parent  Teacher Conference, progress reports, report card information, High School process meeting) is translated in our high volume  languages for ease.      Parents of Ells will be invited to the one-on-one meeting during Tuesday's Parent engagement work time through a  parent letter or email where applicable. If a parent is unable to attend the meeting a follow up phone conversation will be  scheduled. ENL teachers will keep a record of this with their teams CPT Google doc.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Wagner benefits from a very active Parent Association and typically school wide events are well attended from our  parents.  Title III parent meetings and ESL Parent Teacher conferences in years past were attended by approximately 40% of  our ELL families, with nearly all families in touch with the ESL Provider  throughout the school year.  Additionally we have an  international pot luck lunch that ELL families are invited to attend in the Spring.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jennifer Rehn, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Wagner Middle School                                                                              School DBN: 02m167  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).

Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Our assessment of written translation needs is based on our Home Language Surveys, new student registrations,  meetings with parents (including our Parent Association meetings and Parent Teacher Conferences), meetings  with our parent coordinator, and information offered by our ENL teacher, Ms. Nevins . We also look at student  records including emergency contact cards and reports on ATS that indicate home language. We have a  spreadsheet of ELLs/FELLS by class that indicate home language and parental preference for communication. In  addition to this spreadsheet, we utilize ATS reports to review the language needs of the school and upload these  reports to google docs for regular review.    Our findings gave us an indication that we have small volume needs for translations in Russian, Portuguese,  Korean, Italian, Serbo-Croatian, Twi, Albanian, Macedonian, Arabic, Danish, Begali, Thai, Japanese, Hungarian,  Hebrew, German, and Turkish.
