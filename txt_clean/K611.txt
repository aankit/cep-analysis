This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Origins’ mission is to nurture and develop students as problem-solvers and flexible thinkers, individuals who have  mastered the process and motivation necessary to attain success through today’s constantly evolving educational  expectations.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The instructional philosophy of the school is based on the belief that to be prepared for success after high school, in  college and in a career, students must learn how to set clear goals for a project, whether it’s an essay, a presentation,  a business plan, or themselves, and see those goals through to completion through a process of inquiry and research- based work. They must also be comfortable presenting to an audience, working in collaboration with others, and  reflecting on their work. To support and develop these skills, students will engage in project-based units of study, an  interdisciplinary liberal arts curricula, technology assisted personalized learning experiences, arts integrated studies,  and real-world internships, creating a portfolio of their work and growth over their four years of high school. As a  culminating experience, students will publicly present and defend their work twice a year to panels of students,  teachers, parents, and community members. Through the school’s personalized college and career goal-setting  program, students learn how to create long-term goals and achieve them through immediate concrete actions and  study. And as a result of our values of curiosity, creativity, reflection, empathy, and determination we not only  develop intellectually active students, but nurture compassionate ones.         Origins High School has just finished its fifth year located on the Frank J. Macchiarola Educational Complex in the  diverse neighborhood of Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. We have an ethnically and academically diverse student  population that represents our community with over 24 different languages spoken in the school and a 19% English  Language Learner population. To support our diverse students we work with a Community Based Organization,  Partnership with Children, which provide individual and group counseling services, trains students as peer mediators,  and provides community resources and workshops for parents. As we end our fifth year, we continue to expand our  course offerings, including multiple APs and a full range of visual arts and music courses, developing an aligned and  cohesive school-wide curriculum, and building college readiness in our graduates.   In addition to our community-based supports and curricular focus, we are a PROSE school, innovating in our calendar,  schedule, and programming options for students. Our calendar has been tailored to support our student end of term  presentations and celebrations of work. Our schedule serves to offer students with both their core academic courses,  as well as additional electives in English and the Arts. As we grow, we continue to build and develop a rich Arts  program, offering a variety of courses in visual art, digital art, and music.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Origins High School consists of a population of 19% English language learners with approximately another 40% of the  population consisting of former English language learners. This population of both current and former ELLs requires  careful attention and planning for literacy instruction in all subject areas, as well as specific parent involvement  strategies that take language and cultural needs into account.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   During our fifth year, we focused on Writing Instruction by defining what writing looks like in different content areas  given our school-wide shared instructional practices. We also continued our work with our Learning Partner Program  (LPP) partner schools, Academy for Young Writers and Landmark. Working with the same partner schools for a third  year, we were able to capitalize on our ongoing relationship and delve deeply into focused department work across all   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      three schools. This work has strengthened our ability to identify and tackle specific problems of practice in the school,  and as a result of our year-end needs assessment, we have decided to focus on increasing the rigor of our instruction  to make sure students are fully college ready.      A second area of growth this year has been our Effective School Leadership. During the prior year, we worked to align  our teacher team practices across departments and to develop a shared learning cycle and protocol for analyzing and  responding to student work. This year we focused on better developing distributive leadership to support each  department's unique needs in relation to our shared writing goal. We again used our core LPP team as a focal point of  development and are excited to continue this work in the 2018-2019 school year as a host school.      Additional areas of focus for our fifth year are continuing to develop a Supportive Environment through the shared  routines of Restorative Justice practices, and increasing parent involvement, especially in 11th and 12th grade.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 22K611   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   427   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     As a result of our Quality Review and college readiness metrics, we have identified that rigor is inconsistent across  curriculum plans and student outcomes: 1) curriculum is not fully aligned to college readiness outcomes; 2) not all  students know what each of their assessments mean; 3) staff understanding of Standards-Based Grading is  Incomplete; 4) curriculum, instruction, and assessment are not fully aligned; 5) the school is not fully planning for the  needs of all sub-groups.

Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   If we define and develop college readiness within all subject areas, guidance, and social-emotional work, then by June of  2019 there will be an increase of 10% in all students meeting college readiness benchmarks and an increase of 20% in  ELLs and Student with Disabilities performance towards college readiness benchmarks.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  We have worked over the past three years to implement Restorative Practices across our school with the results being  a reduction in suspensions from 60 total suspensions in 2015-2016 to 58 in 2016-2017 to 53 in 2017-2018, even while  the school has continued to grow (an 18.02% proportion of suspensions to overall student population in 2015-2016,  13.36% in 2016-2017, and 12.59% in 2017-2018). However, the work is far from complete, and the practices are not  ubiquitous across all classrooms and advisories. Based on a review of incident reports, anecdotes, and student  growth, we lack consistent Restorative Practice structures, scaffolds, and collaborative opportunities to address  student behavior and nurture a positive school culture.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35        Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Origins High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community..      Origins High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Origins uses different assessments to assess the literacy skills of our ELLs.  In addition to the initial NYSITELL and yearly  NYSESLAT results, we use the NYC Performance Series to identify the reading level of each ELL in relaiton to the Common Core  Standards, as well as our other students.  The information from the initial baseline administration of the assessments is used  to inform classroom instruction, from the level of text used to differentiate instruction for specific students to the composition  of student pairs and groups.  The Performance Series is then administered again as a benchmark assessment in the winter and  again in the late spring.       We also give students writing and reading assessments in their native language.  These assessments provide information about  where students function within their native language and their approximate grade level.  Looking at trends over the past two  years has helped us identify and serve our different student populations appropriately.  This information is used to help us  understand students' prior educational experiences and proficiency, so that we can properly tailor our content area and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      literacy interventions ond modifications to their appropriate level. We also offer students opportunities to read and write at  the appropriate level in their native language.           2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Using this information, we placed students in appropriate leveled reading intervention groups, with our entering and  emerging ELLs working with our ESL teacher on scaffolded strategies, basic decoding and encoding skills, and direct vocabulary  instruction, utilizing Access Code, a blended learning platform.  Our advanced level ELLs were placed in appropriate reading  intervention groups with other teachers, using independent reading and small group readings to focus on individual skill  development based on their appropriate level.  As we transition between trimesters, we reassess student progress based on  in-class performance and assessments and reconfigure our intervention groups as necessary.  Our intervention groups function  in addition to push-in and pull-out support, as well as a stand alone course, of the two groups with our intermediate  level ELLs focusing on decoding and encoding and vocabulary instruction and our advanced level ELLs receiving more content- area supports.       Additionally, our analysis of students performance and progress on all assessments show our growing Arabic-speaking Yemeni  students struggle the most with English language skills and content literacy.  As a result we have provided targeted tutoring in  science and social studies to these students throughout the year to assist in content acquisition.  We also added a summer  enrichment program for entering and emerging ELLs to support basic reading and math skills.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We use a variety of measures to evaluate success.  We utilize NYSESLAT scores and AMAO targets to track the progress made  by students and to set goals and adjust programming of students.  We use the Performance Series reading assessment to track  reading progress and meeting our CEP goals.  We also use Regents pass rates to evaluate student content knowledge vs.  English language acquisition.  Furthermore, we use ELL performance on class standards and summative projects to track  overall success.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    As mentioned above, we have after-school, stand alone classes, pull out services, and a summer enrichment program for  ELLs.  Additionally, almost all classes in the school that serve ELLs are co-taught with a licensed ESL teacher to support  students.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Our NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data reinforces the findings of our other assessments.  Certain language groups make gains in  English language skills at a greater pace than other groups across the four years of data we have, although we are seeing all  students make gains.  Out of the 72 ELLS currently enrolled, 36 have current NYSESLAT scores that allow us to see growth 2 are  students who recently returned to the system recently and do not have a current NYSESLAT result to determine growth, and  the remainder are students new to the country.  Out of the 38, 9 have grown two levels between 2015 and 2016 (ie. from an  entering to a transitioning or from emerging to expanding), 13 have grown one level between 2015 and 2016, 14 have  remained at the same level with 10 remaining at expanding, 3 at transitioning, and 1 at entering, and two students moved  from expanding to transitioning.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         We have a beginning of year training in August for all staff that always includes ELL data analysis and planning for our current  students' needs, in addition to weekly ESL department meetings and grade team data reviews monthly.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   a) ESL instruction is delivered through a combination of Push-In and Pull-Out services.  Our ESL instruction focuses on  a blend of co-teaching by a content area teacher and an ESL licensed pedagogue, and Pull-Out sessions to support  reading and math instruction, as well as support content area work.  Modifications to the students’ programs are  conducted on the basis of student needs and prioritizing core academic subjects to maximize continuity of  instruction.  Additional small group instruction to support students in English acquisition is conducted during an  elective period in 10th, 11th, and 12th grade (predominantly when other students have foreign language courses) and  after-school for 9th grade students.  Students are programmed based on ELL status by grade in general education  courses with one section of entering and emerging ELLs and a second section of transitioning and expanding  ELLs.  They attend most of their classes with heterogeneous general education students.  Our content area classes are  heterogeneously grouped with highly qualified content area teachers who receive professional development in ESL  methodologies.  Our ELL students also receive extra support in class from an ESL licensed teacher. For Pull-Out  sessions, ELL students are grouped according to their proficiency level as prescribed by the New York State  Guidelines.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   To ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided, our ESL Coordinator, Principal, and Programmer  analyze each ELL's NYSITELL and NYSESLAT score when available to identify entitled students and to schedule the ESL program  as mandated by CR Part 154.        • Students who score at the Entering or Emerging levels receive a minimum of 360 minutes of ESL instruction per week  which is delivered through integrated co-taught courses across all subjects, as well as a small group instructional period for  ENL that meets three times each week for an hour each time      • Students who score at the Transitioning or Expanding level receive a minimum of 180 minutes in ELA instruction per week  along with co-taught subject area courses, and small group instruction to support content acquisition and academic vocabulary  development.  The program includes two components:        • English Language Arts instructional component is delivered through instruction in English Language Arts and ESL.        • Content Area instructional support is delivered through ESL methodologies, Sheltered Instruction and strategies with a  co-teacher in most classes.     Origins has 72 ELL students who are served by a 6 licensed ESL teachers.  Furthermore, schedules are developed to meet the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      mandated number of instructional periods for each student’s proficiency level.   Additionally, ELL instruction is a part of our  instructional focus each year with a focus on literacy as a part of our CEP.  Our teacher teams explore instructional practices  weekly and design support for students.  Students receive Push-In and Pull-Out ESL instruction during other content area  classes, as well as ELA.  In almost all cases, students receive more than the minimum number of weekly minutes required by  CR-154.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.         All content area classes that utilize Push-In/Pull-Out with an ESL teacher are delivered in English. Freestanding ESL classes  use the SIOP (Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol) model of instructional support, along with the support of Access  Code, a blended learning decoding program used predominantly with entering and emerging ELLs. Content area classes also  utilize modified class work and activities to provide access to the content for ELLs.  Content area and ESL classes use  instructional materials and texts for different language proficiency levels.  Additionally, digital resources that support different  language proficiencies are used; all entering and emerging ELL students are assigned an iPad individually, and taught how to  use these digital resources to support class instruction.  There are additional resources in the different students' native  languages to support English and content area instruction.  We continue to develop these resources and a native language  library as our curriculum develops. Content area teachers also develop language objectives that correspond to their content  goals and utilize some strategies aligned with the SIOP model.  Entering and emerging ELLs have access to bilingual glossaries  for content area classes and also use Google translate and other digital resources through their individually assigned  iPads.  Classes, both content area and ESL, use a variety of visual aids.  ESL teachers and content area teachers collaborate  through weekly meetings and instructional materials sharing to support ELLs language development.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?          All newcomer ELLs are given a writing assessment in their native language to determine their writing proficiency and  provide data on prior educational experiences.  Entering and emerging ELL students, along with some selected transitioning  and expanding ELLs also participate in leveled independent reading in the native language to both assess and support their  continued native language development.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. We have a small number of SIFE students.  We assess academic abilities through a battery of assessments and program  them for an appropriate section of our ESL program.  SIFE students would then be programmed for appropriate additional  intervention services through our after school ESL period.  b. Newcomers receive differentiated instruction through our Push-In/Pull-Out ESL program.  Extra support is provided in  content area classes through the ESL teacher. The ESL teacher and content area teachers use scaffolding strategies, graphic  organizers and visual aids to support literacy and content area instruction.  Newcomers are also provided with supplementary  materials such as leveled books/texts and native language libraries.  In addition, entering and emerging ELLs are provided with  bilingual glossaries and access to Google translate in all content area classes through an individual iPad.   Our Pull-Out program  focuses on developing reading, writing, and math skills, in addition to supporting content area classwork.  The ESL Teacher  uses the SIOP model to support content-area classes.  Newcomers use high-interest leveled texts in content areas.  c. For our developing ELLs, we provide support similar to our newcomers, with a focus on improving reading and writing skills,  as well as academic vocabulary acquisition.  Appropriate Independent Reading texts and after-school interventions focusing on  reading strategies and written responses are used to support these students, in addition the scaffolding strategies, graphic  organizers, and visual aids.     d. Our focus with Long Term ELLs is on increasing academic vocabulary, reading, and writing in the content area classes.  In  addition, we use targeted in-class and after-school intervention groups and scaffolded access to grade level texts to support   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      these learners.  e.  Our former ELLs within 1-2 years of testing proficient participate in targeted interventions through continued in-class  support, small group instruction focused on complex sentence composition and academic vocabulary acquisition.  Students are  grouped by reading, writing, or math needs and appropriate instructional materials and instruction is delivered.  For less  proficient students additional strategy instruction is accomplished through an independent reading workshop.  For less  proficient students in math, ST Math and Khan Academy, alongside conferencing with the math teacher work to support  individual progress.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our ESL teacher collaborates with the special education team to plan for ESL instruction that is differentiated and aligned with  a student's IEP. A variety of supplementary grade-level materials, including books on tape alongside the text, leveled books in  the content areas, and modified project criteria are used to support these students.  Visuals, graphic organizers and hands on  activities in the content areas are also used to assist students in learning. Purposeful groupings of students to support activities  in classes and required targeted small group intervention groups during after-school are also used to provide all students with  access to the content, while advancing literacy proficiency.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  We make every effort to use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibilty to meet ELL-SWDs needs.  In addition to support  from the special education team and ESL teacher, students are required to attend after-school small group ESL, which provides  tutoring and extra support in a small group setting.  Teachers of ELL-SWDs have common planning time embedded in their  weekly instructional program, along with both a team meeting focused on curriculum development and a second meeting  focused on student supports.  ELL-SWDs have some flexible programming, being able to participate in small group instruciton  with ELLs.  During Pull Out ESL sessions, ELL-SWDs would be grouped together with general education students.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  We offer targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math and other content areas support for all ELLs in a Freestanding  ESL program in English with some additional support in their native language.  Currently, we program our interventions based  on our beginning of year assessments.  Our entering and emerging ELLs are grouped together for interventions and our  transitioning and expanding ELLs are grouped together or with similarly proficient general education students.     ELA:  Our entering and emerging 9  th   grade students are pulled out by the ESL Teacher 4 times a week.  Pull-Out sessions are  focused on advancing ELLs reading, writing, and math skills through the SIOP model and in conjunction with Access Code, a  digital reading intervention program.  In addition, this group receives targeted small group instruction during after-school,  provided by an ESL teacher.  Our transitioning and expanding 9  th   grade ELLs receive 1 pull out session per week, along with  in class supports through modified activities, targeted independent reading, and leveled texts, in addition to our small group  extended day program, where they are programmed based on their reading level.  In the upper grades, students receive  support in a small group period as part of their schedule, which focuses on basic language acquisition if they are entering or  emerging, or on academic vocabulary and more complex grammar if they are transitioning or expanding     Math:  Students are supported by the ESL Teacher during Pull-Out and Push-In sessions based on their English proficiency  level.  Students receive targeted individual support through ST Math and Khan Academy and supported by the math teacher  up to 2 times per week based on ongoing assessment.  Entering and emerging ELLs are supported by the ESL teacher 4 days  per week in targeted intervention groups and transitioning and expanding ELLs are grouped based on their proficiency level  with general education students.  Students use a blend of ST Math, Khan Academy, and teacher conferencing to support  individual progress in math      Science:  Small group project-based science lesson support is provided during the school day, along with Push-In services.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      Leveled science texts and audio materials are provided during class and after school to support content area  instruction.  Additional support is provided during after school to support the work from class based on student need.  We also  continue to develop a library of native language texts aligned with the curriculum.    Social Studies: Small group project-based social studies lesson support is provided during the school day, along with Push In  services. Leveled social studies texts, digital resources, and audio materials are provided during class and after school to  support content area instruction.  Additional support is provided during after school to support the work from class based on  student need.  We also continue to develop a library of native language texts aligned with the curriculum.  Additional support  is offered in Arabic for 10  th   and 11  th   graders taking the Global or US History Regents.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We are working to improve the structure and efficacy of our co-teaching partnerships to support ELLs in the classroom,  utilizing small group instruction and flexible groupings.  Additionally, we hope to add a Saturday English course for students  and parents in the new school year to support family English-language acquisition and home study skills.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We have no plan to discontinue any of our programs at this point.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs participate in all programs at our school, from internships, to our varied after-school clubs (Art, Green Team/Garden Club,  etc.), as well as on our sports teams (with our global student population, we offer global sports from the more common soccer  team to the less common cricket team, as well as everything in between).  We also have a Muslim Student Association, a  Multicultural Day, and feature our diversity through Community Cultural Potlucks, cultural presentations during our daily  Morning Meeting and other events.  This is all in addition to our academic programs, such as College Now, Regents Prep,  Summer Enrichment, and small group tutoring.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We use a variety of resources to support ELLs.  Our resources include:  a. native language texts, fiction and non-fiction, in Haitian-Creole, Urdu, Russian, Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, Bengali, and  Spanish  b. leveled English language texts in our English classroom to support independent reading  c. Continental's New York ELLs -  NYSESLAT instructional materials aligned to the CCSS  d. Technology: 1 to 1 ratio of students to iPads, assigned to each ELL student with instruction in how to use online bilingual  dictionaries, Google translate, ST Math, Khan Academy, among other more specific English language resources based on the  topic of study, as well as recording software for practicing speaking and listening.  Classrooms have wireless listening stations  and audio that covers topics from class, as well as books on CD in English that correspond to high-interest books.  We also have  laptops, projectors, and a computer lab to support instruction.   e.

Continental's Big Ideas in Math  g. Vocabulary instructional texts, including Wordly Wise, Word by Word, and Academic Vocabulary by Marzano  h. Access Code - individualized online reading development program for entering or emerging ELLs     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We currently only have an ESL program.  Our ESL program utilizes independent reading books in our students' native  languages,  some non-fiction texts aligned with the curriculum in content area classes, digital resources through the use of  iPads with access to bilingual dictionaries, Google translate, and additional native language supports.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      ELL students use many of the same materials as students in general education classes with modifications and individualized  opportunities for skill development.  ELL students complete the same projects and presentations as students in general  education classes but with modifications to support ELL students' ability to access the material.  Independent reading books,  non-fiction texts, and activities are aligned to the content area classes and grade appropriate.  ELL students participate in the  same school-wide activities as other students.               15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We use a variety of resources to support ELLs.  Our resources include:  a. native language texts, fiction and non-fiction, in Haitian-Creole, Urdu, Russian, Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, Bengali, and  Spanish  b. leveled English language texts in our English classroom to support independent reading  c.

Access Code - individualized online reading development program for entering or emerging ELLs      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Prior to the school year, we reach out to all new ELL families and discuss our school, the school year, and families'  background.  ELL students attend an orientation where they meet teachers and fellow students, as well as their advisor.  We  partner new ELLs with other speakers of their native language who are proficient in English, in order to help acclimate them to  the culture and structure of the school.  We also work to pair families with community resources in their native language, ie.  counseling through the Arab American League.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We offer a Russian and Chinese language course to students.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         Our professional development for teachers begins over the summer.  All teachers and administrators participate curriculum  development workshops dedicated to developing curricular modifications and language objectives.  Starting with the school  year, weekly curriculum development meetings focus on modifications of class activities, assignments, and curriculum to  support ELL students.  Curriculum development will continue to focus on differentiation strategies including stations,  conferencing, individualized digital resources, and incorporating native language supports using a collaborative inquiry team  approach.  Our year-long CEP goal is to improve students' writing ability, particularly on timed writing tasks, which is further  supported by our involvement with LPP, focused on writing instruction at the high school level and adding additional  compensated development sessions for all staff throughout the year.  Furthermore, we have chosen to focus on the efficacy of  co-teaching pairs throughout the year as part of our CEP to support stronger performance on Regents exams for ELLs and  SwDs.     Our summer institute will focus on co-teaching, writing instruction, and applying our standards-based assessment model to  support ELL students in literacy development.  Visits to successful ELL programs through the Internationals Network at other  schools with similarly diverse language types are scheduled for teachers and administrators throughout the year.  The school  also provides teachers and administrators with opportunities to attend conferences and conventions focuing on ELL student  instruction.  Our ESL instructors attend PD opportunities through the DELLs, as well as other PD opportunities, such as the  state TESOL conference, NCTE, and NCTM.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our professional development begins in the summer with 20 hours of workshops for all teachers and an additional 12 hours  for new teachers focused heavily on differentiation strategies, reading instruction across content areas, and providing access  for ELLs. This is supported by one weekly 50 minute session of curriculum development for all teachers focused on the  following topics:  a. integrating language objectives into content area instruction (with a focus this year on writing standards)  b. using standards-based grading to assess ELL students  c. modifying instructional activities and curriculum to provide access to ELL students (with a focus on co-teaching this year)  d. differentiating classroom instruction through stations, individualized digital resources, and conferencing structures  e. assessing ELL student progress       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   We are working to schedule individual meetings with all of our ELL families to take place during the school day before the end  of October with the ESL teacher they most closely work with, as well as a counselor.  During this meeting the most recent  assessment results will be discussed, along with a review of their transcript, outstanding Regents, current progress in  coursework, current program, available interventions, and goals for the year.  After an initial meeting of the ESL team and  administration, ESL teachers schedule meetings with their assigned students.  Depending on the needs of the student and  family, either an in-house translator is scheduled to be present or a conference call with translation services is arranged.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   During the summer prior to the start of 9th grade parents of ELLs are invited to an orientation for families.  Students and  parents have the opportunity to meet teachers, staff, and their student's advisors.   Administrators, counselors and staff are  also available to address questions and concerns.  Parents receive information about available programs and school  supports.  All families are introduced to our community-based organization, Partnership with Children, and given the  opportunity to enroll students in counseling services.  Parents are invited to attend their student's Roundtable presentations      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         three times per year to participate in their student's progress and learning.  We have workshops tailored to our ELL population  through our community-based organization throughout the year.  This year we are also working to establish a Saturday literacy  program for students and parents, especially our growing Arabic-speaking population.      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    All ELLs particpate in our advisory program where they are paired with an advisor who acts as the liaison to familes, monitors  students' progress, and supports students socially and emotionally.  This program also focuses on helping student through the  transition from middle school to high school.  We also work with a community-based organization, Partnership with Children, that  provides counseling services, family outreach and training, and social work services, ranging from providing school supplies and  backpacks to students to contacting and interacting on behalf of students with outside counseling and community resources.  All  incoming families are introduced to the CBO and provided with access to their services.  Our school counselors focus on developing  relationships with community groups that serve our diverse ELL populations.                           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, John Banks, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      At the beginning of the year and as students enter the school, we use the Home Language Survey, a family  interview, student background interview protocol, and advisors' assessments of student's home languages to  assess how many and in what languages of services we will need. We additionally use our summer parent  orientation to confirm the findings of advisors and the HLIS. Advisor notes are kept in a shared Google Drive  spreadsheet, as are the results of the HLIS. The HLIS and Bluecards are maintained in the main office, while the  results of the educational background survey are maintained by the ESL teachers. We take advantage of DOE  translation services for written and oral translation, Google translate for digital translation services, and teachers  on staff who speak a foreign language (we currently have Arabic, Spanish, French, Creole, Chinese, and Russian  spoken by staff).          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59     2.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      We post messages to our website and email families in the languages we can translate internally.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Due to the large number of families needing translation services in our school, we review key provisions of A-663  during our staff summer training each year, as well as providing a directory of translation services and resources in our  faculty handbook and on our staff website page. Additionally, we have placed a small card with translation services  numbers on each phone that dials out in the building for convenience of accessibility. Prior to parent conferences and  other events, we also ask advisors to notify the office with the scheduled time of needed services, so we can allocate  relevant staff.             Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information.

Posted in our office is a sign indicating the availability of translation services for incoming families. During the parent  orientation for new families, we show parents where resources are available on line for materials in their native  language, including the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities. We have ensured that our ELL coordinator, Dean,  Assistant Principal, Principal, and CBO know which services are available through the DOE's translation services and  how to access these resources. Staff has been trained in using Google Translate, and outward facing staff have been  trained in how to utilize the translation functions of our online grading system and website to communicate with  parents. When necessary, we ensure that qualified translators are available, either in-house or by phone depending  on the applicable language.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We conduct a twice yearly parent survey, which includes questions similar to the Learning Environment Survey. The  survey will be administered in November and February and will include questions on communication and language  access. The survey will be online and include translated questions for our diverse student population.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65
