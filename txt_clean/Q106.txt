The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets, the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             8      Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.

The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             9      monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title   I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.

At Lighthouse Elementary School, our teachers adapt the content,  methodology, or delivery of instruction based on each students' specific learning needs identified in their IEP. We use  an SDI summary sheet for all students with disabilities to identify their strengths, needs, environment, materials, how  learning is measured, and instruction. Our teachers then use this information to plan each lesson. Professional  development is conducted weekly, providing focused learning opportunities for teachers to grow and develop their  pedagogy towards the attainment of the school’s vision.   Students have made significant progress in reading. Our academic support staff consists of all classroom teachers and  paraprofessionals using an all hands-on-deck approach to improve outcomes for all students. All teachers and  paraprofessionals engage students who are performing below grade level standards in reading, receive a tier two  Response to Intervention (RtI) first period each morning using Fountas and Pinnell's Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI)  System. As a result, each teacher and paraprofessional in the school are assigned small groups of 3-7 students to  provide seven week cycles of targeted, RtI. All students in the LLI program begin each day with 50 minutes of  targeted, systemic reading instruction built into the daily schedule.   STEM is teaching and facilitating inquiry and content of science, technology, engineering, and s in relation to real  world topics. At Lighthouse Elementary, we believe that STEM is an exciting and engaging way for students to learn  literacy, collaboration skills, design, and to become problem-solvers. In 2018-2019, students will learn how to code,  program robots, use laser legos, interview each other using digital and video cameras and learn how to type. These  STEM projects will guide problem solving and encourage risk taking. STEM is an integration of science, technology,  engineering and mathematics, through the incorporation of hands-on investigations, which expose students to fields  of STEM, in order to peak their interest in these fields of study and possibly aspire to obtain careers in the science,  technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.   Students of Lighthouse Elementary experience the Arts in music, drama, visual arts, and dance at lease 2-3 times each  week during their regular school schedule. They have additional opportunities to learn the Arts during Extended  Learning Time that takes place three times a week. Lighthouse also has a dance club that students voluntarily take  part in during their lunch break. Throughout the year, performances in the Arts are scheduled and parents are invited  to see their children perform on stage, singing, playing musical instruments, and moving to choreographed dances.  This is all done through an ArtistYear Grant that provides a full time dance/drama teacher, a full time Counseling in  Schools -CIS counselor via an ESD/SVP Grant, and a Lighthouse Elementary full time music teacher.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Lighthouse Elementary School has a total of 70 SWD and 24 ENL students. Students with Disabilities and ENL students  require differentiated instruction and tiered interventions to address their academic and social emotional needs.  Some students with disabilities also require supports through related services such as Occupational therapy, Speech  and Language therapy, Physical therapy, and Counseling. Special Education teachers provided specially designed  instruction where they follow and implement Individualized Education Plans based on each students’ individual  needs.    English as a New Language students receive supports to help accommodate the four modalities of Listening, Speaking,  Reading, and Writing. Students receive support by using the online platform Imagine Learning. Imagine Learning is in  their native language and gives interventions and activities on their individual needs (such as phonemic awareness,  sight words, reading comprehension, and fluency). Students also use MY-ON and Reading A to Z which provides  leveled books, vocabulary, and comprehension activities in their native language, and English. The classroom teachers  and ENL teacher collaborate and design activities to help students with the modalities on a daily basis. The ENL  teacher conducts both push in, and pull out instruction. Instruction is differentiated and given based on the students’  current language level.      2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             12      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Rigorous Instruction:   Students in grades K – 5 benefit from a blended learning environment as they learned how the scientific method can  be applied to everyday life. In a collaborative settings, students learn computational thinking and focus on real world  applications of problem solving. According to the 2017-18 NYS data, students in fourth grade made 70% progress on  the NYS English Language Arts assessment from the prior year, and fifth grade made 54.2% progress. In the 2017-18  NYS Mathematics assessments, fourth grade made 35% progress from the prior year, while fifth grade had a 42 %  progress. On the New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT), 72% of the English  Language Learners (ELLs) are performing at Expanding or Commanding levels.   During the 2017-18 school year, using the Fountas and Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI), 100% of  students showed growth in their reading levels. A total of 90% of students increased their reading levels by at least  two or more reading levels, 22% increased by two levels, 20% increased by three levels, 15% increased four levels and  19% of students in the LLI program increased five or more levels. In the 2017-18, New York City ELA Performance Task  in writing, there was a 56.6% growth in students moving from level 1 to level 2. There was also a 27.8% increase in  students performing on levels 3 and 4 in writing, resulting in an overall 60.8% growth of students writing performance  in grades 2-5 on the End-of-Year assessments. In the 2017-18, New York City Math Performance Task in writing, there  was also a 20% increase in students performing on levels 3 and 4 in math, resulting in an overall 60.8% growth of  students' math performance in grades 2-5 on the End-of-Year assessments.   Therefore our instructional focus is: Students will engage in rigorous Math instruction with a focus on procedural skills  and fluency that will transfer into stronger problem solving and constructive responses.   Supportive Environment:   The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their  teachers and peers. Using the Cloud9 World character education program, students learn a new character trait each  month that is reinforced each morning during our town hall meeting. Students receive explicit instruction on the  monthly character trait each Friday and are celebrated daily when they observed by any staff member displaying one  of the learned traits. Data for 2017-2018 showed there was a 8.9% decrease in levels 3 and above infractions  compared to 2016-2017 infractions in OORS reports.   Collaborative Teachers:   Collaborative articulation meetings are held weekly with administration to facilitate classroom environment and  instructional expectations, using student data as our lens. In addition, Datawise meetings are facilitated by teachers  on a rotation basis. Teachers also engage in four cycles of professional learning to support their practice and school- wide coherence for implementing strong practices. To build rigor into the individual grade curricula, we have  empowered teachers on different grade levels to engage in Vertical Teams; to examine school-wide coherence across  grade levels in specific content areas, track disaggregated groups of students, and make educated decisions from day  to day experience to evolve instruction that is differentiated to a higher degree, increase academic rigor to support  and challenge students, and to create a strategic transition from one grade to the next.   Effective School Leadership:   Teachers grow in their pedagogical skills and the use of data analysis during the course of the year. Collaborative  planning time is strategically built into the daily school schedule. Grade level collaborative teams plan instructional  differentiated activities and create innovative ways of providing rigorous instruction for all students. Collaboration  between classroom teachers and the out of classroom teachers (program clusters) across the grades provides a  consistent approach to instruction, differentiation, assessment, and goal setting. Administration schedules time for  teachers to plan and provide for each child's individual needs (including students with disabilities and English   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             13      Language Learners) according to formative and summative data sets. In addition to the weekly tracking and Datawise  meetings, comprehensive Student Learning and Data Conferences takes place four times during the year with  administration to monitor and track individual student progress. To further support students, teachers are assigned to  provide Academic Intervention Support where they push into classrooms to provide small groups instruction for  students who perform below benchmark expectations. A diagnostic-prescriptive approach is used to target student's  strengths and weaknesses, and to formulate targeted, flexible groups. The budget is used to ensure students as well  as teachers have the resources they need to support students' academic development.   Strong Family and Community Ties:   Lighthouse Elementary partners with the Queens District Attorney’s Office to support students in social-emotional  sessions within the school. Representatives from the District Attorney’s Office visit to the school weekly to work with  the upper grade (4-5) classes on topics related to positive behaviors and being good citizens. Also, New York Smiles (a  mobile dental service) comes to the school twice a year in order to provide free dental services to our students.  Lighthouse Elementary also partners with Counseling In Schools, to provide mental health support to students and  their families, Culture Play and Art's House Inc., are other organizations we partner with to provide STEM and visual  arts instruction to students. In addition, the school hosts various parent workshops on a range of instructional topics  during Tuesdays parent engagement share-outs by teachers. The school keeps parents informed of other workshops  and school events via the PS 106 school website, newsletters, blackboard connect and flyers. Parents are invited to  school events such as Harvest Festival, Science Fair and June Celebration.               2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             14         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 27Q106   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   211   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Strengths:     We are a collaborative teaching community with multiple teaching teams (cycles of professional learning in   literacy and math, Collaborative Action Research Project-CARP, District-Charter Collaboration-DCC and Social  Emotional teams).     Administrators have scheduled a sixth prep for teacher teams. Teachers utilize an additional sixth prep, common  planning meeting with an administrator using a series of data discussion protocol to share data sets and develop  corrective instruction plans.      The school successfully partners with Counseling in Schools where we have a counselor working with students.  Also Culture Play provides STEM for our Extended Learning Time program, while Art House Inc services our ELT  students in visual arts.     We develop goals and action plans using comprehensive formative and summative data sets. The school   demonstrates strategic planning using formative assessment data sets with a focus to narrow and close the  achievement gap.     Administrators support teachers in developing rigorous pedagogic skills through cycles of observations,   professional learning and timely feedback.      Using data, teachers create goal packets, to support students who have not mastered assessed standards in the   units of study throughout the year.     A culture of reflection is created as part of Advance observation feedback given to teachers to improve their   practice in targeted components of the Danielson Framework for Teaching Rubric . As part of teachers'  professional practice, they are to submit reflections to administrators.  Staff and administrators analyze instructional and organizational practices through team meetings,  observations, inter-visitations, reflections, and feedback forms.        Our latest New York State Review, one of the celebration areas for Rigorous Instruction was the implementation   of a blended learning environment where students are using interactive applications appropriate to the levels.    Needs:         Shifting teachers' practice from being teacher-centered to more student-centered is still a goal for 2018-2019.  Supporting teachers to intentionally scaffold lessons using student-centered strategies in writing.  Supporting teachers in using Common Core/Aligned writing program to ensure more rigorous and engaging  writing instruction.     A need for teachers to Improve their instructional methods that incorporate the use of different modalities   including blended learning during instruction to support the different learning styles and students access to the  curriculum (technology, drama, movement, etc...).     Professional development focused on guided writing instruction to provide students with visual models of   exemplary writing.

According to the 2017 New York State Review, one of the celebration areas for Rigorous Instruction was the  implementation of a blended learning environment where students are using interactive applications appropriate to the  levels. The most recent Quality Review, 2016-17 academic year, "Pedagogy" from the Quality Review Indicator was  rated "Proficient" while Curriculum was rated as Well Developed at Lighthouse Elementary School.   Strengths:     The school has seen a reduction in behavioral infractions partly due to the implementation of a character   education program called Cloud9 World which is literacy based.     We are a collaborative teaching community with multiple teaching teams (cycles of professional learning in   literacy and math, Collaborative Action Research Project-CARP, District-Charter Collaboration-DCC and Social  Emotional teams).     The school successfully partners with Counseling in Schools where we have a counselor working with students.  Also Culture Play provides STEM for our Extended Learning Time program, while Art House Inc services our ELT  students in visual arts.     Parent-Engagement/outreach is also done using the platform classdojo as a way to keep parents informed of   their child's performance throughout the school year. Monthly progress reports are also sent to parents.     PS 106 creates a community forum using daily town hall meetings where all students and staff meet to discuss   the character trait of the month....staff members take turns promoting and providing motivational speeches  using the traits.     Teachers successfully use explicit instruction to all students each Friday to reinforce the current trait under   study     All classrooms have a positive character building bulletin board and posters to reinforce the traits.    PS 106 celebrates the work of students on two public bulletin boards each month to represent the current and   the prior month's traits.  Lunch clubs were successfully implemented with a high level of student and staff participation.       At-Risk lunch groups supports students’ social emotional well-being where guidance, school psychologist, and   social worker meet with small groups of students.     Our school conducts cycles of professional learning for teachers to engage in inquiry work. In addition, there is   Collaborative Action Research Project to conduct inquiry in Reading.      There is scheduled common planning time for teachers to collaborate on and data tracking and monitoring.      Needs:   We believe that we will have a decrease in Discipline Code Infractions if we:     Provide cycles of Professional development for staff members in restorative circles, de-escalation and sensitivity   training.     Continued training on the Sanford Harmony program to support positive student-teacher relationships.    Build character through Literacy using a book of the month that aligns to our character education trait for the   months. (Extension of the character education’s impact)     Create a consistent system of classroom routines and procedures that all students are aware of and are   expected to follow.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             54         State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             55        A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             56      Section 10: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of  this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school.  Lighthouse Elementary, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for  creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the  school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team,  Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Lighthouse Elementary will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● Using various modalities to communicate with parents such as Blackboard Connect (automatic all call system),  streaming information on a TV screen in the main lobby, sending home written notifications (letters, flyers, and  Lighthouse Elementary school website, etc...)      Providing informational materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their   achievement level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;   ● Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             57      ● Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● Providing professional development opportunities for school staff that include parents in the learning and sharing  to improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents  and other members of the school community, as well as assist parents in supporting their child(ren) at home.      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. The school website provides  our parent community with information on curriculum and much more. There are also translation services available  for parents.      Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee representative.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Various assessment tools are used to assess the early literacy skills of the ELLs in our school.  Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark  Assessments in conjunction with their their Leveled Literacy system (LLI) are used.  Teacher-created assessments are also used  to assess the 4 modalities which are reading, writing, listening and speaking.  With coaching and support, it is expected that  the student's F&P Level will move forward according to the text gradient, and that the student will meet his or her grade level  goals. Also, our school uses reading and writing performances from Expeditionary Learning and Core Knowledge.  These  programs cover various content areas such as social studies and ELA.  The ENL teacher also works to identify specific gaps in  the ELLs' learning and in developing effective scaffolding strategies to address each of his or her student's unique needs. For  some, this will mean increased attention to phonics and vocabulary building; for others, it will mean developing skills in  accessing background knowledge, making connections and inferences by modeling critical thinking. For the upper grade ELLs, it  was found that we need to focus on developing reading fluency, writing skills and academic vocabulary.  For the lower grades,  phonics, fluency, reading comprehension, structural analysis, decoding, and phonemic awareness are areas in which students   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             64      are still struggling.  For all grades, writing has been a struggle.  Knowing this, the ENL teacher will be able to make reading, and  writing the primary year focus although all 4 modalities will be covered, an emphasis can be placed on those subjects.  The  teacher can then seek and attend professional development opportunities that are related to writing where they can gain  more strategies to help struggling readers and writers.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The structures that we have in place to support these efforts are that we have cycles of LLI (our Leveled Literacy System)  where we assess students' reading levels every cycle and create interventions to help support them. Students are also given  pre-tests and post-tests before every learning unit so teachers can measure growth. Teachers also track data regularly on  students and have Student Led Data Conference (SLDC) with administration to discuss student goals and progress.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  ELL success is evaluated primarily on NYSESLAT results when our students meet the projected goals of proficiency(AMAO).  Success is also measured on ELLs performance on state tests (ELA, Math, Science). In addition, as delineated earlier, we have  ongoing assessments throughout the school year such as the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment, ELA Performance  Assessment Writing Prompts (MOSL), ECLAS-2 for grades K through 3 and EPAL. We also utilize the ELL Periodic Assessment for  grades 3-5 to determine and measure progress. For our lower grades, our ESL teacher assesses phonemic awareness and sight  word recognition to monitor progress. We anticipate and look forward to also incorporating technology by the use of some  subscriptions we have found  that provide academic support and enrichment, such as Achieve3000, Smarty Ants, MyON books,  TenMarks, iReady, BrainPOP, Imagine Learning and Raz-Kids. The use of these materials will help us monitor the progress our  ELLs demonstrate and ultimately set up our children for success as we prepare them for a more technologically-based society.  Finally, the success of our ELL programs is measured by the attainment of specific short-term goals which is determined by the  ELL and General Education teacher after identifying areas for improvement.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We have targeted interventions for each student according to their specific needs and we use daily progress monitoring  checklists to address them, and next steps following the interventions. As mentioned previously, teachers also have a SLDC  (Student Led Data Conference) with administration to discuss interventions and next steps for students success.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   As a school, we embrace the practices of RtI.  However, we understand that there are   different interventions that we can  utilize with our ELL students at every   tier of the process. Our school currently has an RtI program that uses Fountas and  Pinnell's Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI). Their varying levels are then recorded and lessons are aligned to the students'  levels  and specific needs during differentiated instructional time. As with all of our students, we seek to understand their  characteristics as children and learners so that we can utilize their strengths to assist with their weaknesses. With our ELLs, this  understanding comes from informal classroom observations, conversations with students and their families, data from the  Spanish LAB-R (to evaluate  their proficiency in the native language), and evaluation of their work. We also utilize data from  the RELC to better  understand their learning history (SIFE, past test results) and to see if there are major gaps that need to be  filled.  Information about the socioeconomic status, immigration patterns of the family, and familial support are all qualities  that our team (principal, teachers, social worker, guidance counselor, intervention teachers) use to support our children. Our  baseline assessments allow us to determine where our ELL students are performing.  We understand that their learning may  initially move at a slower pace as they acquire new vocabulary,   adjust to a new culture, and learn the structures of our  school.  What we look for is progress. Some questions we ask to evaluate student progress includes: Is the student growing in  reading and writing, speaking and listening?  Are they establishing friendships within the school setting?  Are they engaged  with cognitively challenging instruction?  We also compare our ELL students with students of similar backgrounds to see if  they are progressing at similar rates while receiving the same types of supports. If we find that our ELL students are not  moving at an appropriate pace, we move to Tier 2 interventions to provide additional supports. Our ENL instructor meets with  classroom teachers to share appropriate strategies. Students are placed in AIS, to work with our teachers, and are  given intensive small group push-in instruction with their teachers.  For instance, we utilize shared reading and writing to   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             65         engage students. Teachers link students' background knowledge to make sense of content. Teachers and classmates engage in  conversations and the sharing of ideas that assist with language development. Teachers use the NYSITELL to identify where the  student is strong, and utilize those strengths to make connections with the English language. We provide additional scaffolds  related to content - immersion into vocabulary, picture/media support, trips, repetition and the breaking down of lessons - to  assist with grasping new ideas.   Before recommending a student for Tier 3, teachers meet with the ENL instructor and  Principal to evaluate whether the ENL setting is appropriate for this particular student.  Interventions   are evaluated and the  PPT team provides the teacher with additional research based ideas to address student needs. If the student continues having  difficulty after all these supports have been put into place, then a more comprehensive evaluation has to be administered to  see if additional services are necessary.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Regarding the NYSITELL, our data shows that most of our eligible ELLs  tend to score at the high beginner and intermediate  levels. Our ELLs tend to  advance steadily in their speaking and listening skills followed by reading  and writing (writing being  the last and most challenging). The NYSESLAT scores for the past three years (between 2013, 2014 and 2015) show  an   interesting pattern: scores in Reading*, with the exception of three   students, rose steadily.  For Listening, Speaking and  Writing, most students' scores from 2011 to 2012 increased. There was a couple of students whose scores remained the same.  From 2012 to   2013 scores in Listening Speaking and Writing, with the exception of Reading(*see   above), went down  significantly.  In 2014, the trend remained the same. For example, two students increased proficiency level along with it being  the first time that the 2 students took the test.  They both increased from  being an intermediate ELL to an advanced ELL.  In  2015, most students NYSESLAT scores went up by at least one level. On NYISTELL for this school year (2016), there are more  Entering scores. Two of those scores are from Non-English speakers. For NYSESLAT for the 2016-2017 school year, NYSESLAT  scores have increased. We have more students at the Emerging level. A few of the students scored in the Transitioning Level,  and two students remained at Expanding level while one student scored at the Expanding level. This data was used to help us  update our schedule, and instruction for students. For the 2017-2018  school year for NYISTELL, we had two students score at  the Entering level, and one score at the Transitioning level.      .              7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The structures that we have in place to disseminate these findings are that we have Parent Orientations, and meetings to help  inform our parents. We also have three parent teacher conferences a year where we keep our parents informed of their child's  progress. We also use these findings to make adjustments to our programs by monitoring and tracking students' language level  according to the NYISTELL and NYSESLAT. Students are programmed to receive instruction based on their language levels and  state requirements (according to CR Part 154).           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Due to the fact that we have very few ELLs, our groups are heterogeneous. Since the ENL teacher is dually certified in  ENL and general education, she is able to service her group with both integrated ENL (within the classrooms) and   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             66         Stand-alone ENL.  Students will be pulled out in no more than 2 contiguous grades.  Students will be of mixed  proficiency levels due to the small population of ELLs and ENL teacher availability. Students will be engaged in ELA as  the content area selected for integrated ENL. Stand-alone ENL will focus on student on the linguistic aspect of  language acquisition. The stand-alone model is implemented by having the students and ENL teacher working in a  small group. The students are usually working in the auditorium with the ENL teacher. The ENL teacher will usually  work with the students on skills that correlate to the 4 modalities (listening, speaking, reading, and writing). The  integrated model is used with both the ENL teacher, and content area teacher co-teaching and while introducing the  lesson. From there the students will break off into their groups and the ENL teacher will better help those ENL  students by scaffolding the lesson (such as using a graphic organizer).   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.                  c.  DL program.  If applicable.                   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Through the collaboration of classroom teachers, cluster teachers, and the administration, a schedule is submitted for  approval containing the required instructional minutes for all our ELLs as per the CR Part 154. English Language Learners  receive between 180 and 360 minutes of stand-alone and integrated ENL every week depending on their levels as determined  by the NYSITELL or the NYSESLAT. The stand-alone services are provided to heterogeneous groups of students across grade  levels.  ELL students whose proficiency level is identified as an entering or emerging level are scheduled to receive 360 minutes  per week.  Both entering and emerging students will be given 180 minutes of stand-alone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated  ENL. Our transitioning students will have a total of 180 minutes with all 180 minutes being integrated ENL.  Our expanding  students will be serviced for 180 minutes total, with all 180 minutes as integrated ENL/ELA. Commanding and former ELLs will  receive a total of 90 minutes of integrated ENL. All proficient students who have tested out of the ELL program are still  required to have transitional ELL support in the classroom for 90 minutes per week. The school ensures that all ELL-SWD's  receive services mandated on their I.E.P. by posting all students I.E.P. on the SESIS Program and through the monitoring and  supervising by our I.E.P. teacher. If the student's I.E.P. teacher mandates that he/she receives ENL instruction, it is brought to  the attention of the ENL teacher. The ENL teacher immediately inputs the student into the schedule for the appropriate  minutes per week. All I.E.P.'s should be reviewed in order to make sure each student receives their mandated  accommodations as well to understand how each child may interpret / retain information. The ENL teacher works in  collaboration with the classroom teachers, and the administration to ensure that all of our ELLs (newcomers, long-term, and  those with special needs) receive their mandated ENL minutes per week.          3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Our school currently has a Freestanding ENL Program (only). Instruction is provided primarily in English. However, native  language glossaries, English and native language dictionaries, as well as classroom library books in native language are used in  conjunction to aid the student in English language acquisition. Where necessary, the ENL teacher will consult with the  Translation and Interpretation Unit for additional assistance. ELLs are also encouraged to utilize the Dial-A-Teacher program  (which provides assistance in the ELL's first language) when they have difficulty completing a homework assignment. The ENL  teacher provides sheltered /scaffolding instruction to all ELLs. When ELLs are having stand-alone ENL instruction, the mini- workshop model is used along with differentiated tasks. The ENL teacher also provides one on one assessment and tutoring to  target specific areas of need. In order to more effectively address areas where ELLs are struggling, the ENL teacher will often  discuss and collaborate with the content area teacher providing the scaffolding (graphic organizers, developing frame of  reference, helping the student to expand academic and specific content area vocabulary, teaching decoding (phonics) and   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             67      reading comprehension strategies, providing additional opportunities for student to practice and develop writing skills,  reviewing and re-teaching specific language usage issues necessary to address difficult subject matter.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Since we are a Freestanding ENL program, the only home language evaluation we administered is through the Spanish Lab-R.  However, we ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language by conducting an informal interview and  completing a survey upon arrival at our school. This process helps determine if a student's home language is English or a  language other than English. Our school takes advantage of the DOE's telephone translation service to ensure we comprehend  the student, and may call upon teacher personnel who have a working knowledge of a student's native language to assist as  necessary. Initial assessments such as the NYSITELL and Spanish LAB-R are administered to help evaluate each potential ELL  student. Following directions explicitly, and noting on the answer key if the student's native language interfered with the  completion of the assessments is important in evaluating a student appropriately. Also, if an informal assessment is needed to  evaluate a student, he/she may use both English and the student's native language to complete the assessment.When state  tests or MOSL assessments are administered, the students are given the math and science parts in their native language (such  as Spanish). The interpreter is used for low-incidence languages (such as Mandarin, and Bengla).         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    A.  There has not been any SIFE students in our school for the past few years.  However, should the occasion occur, the teacher  would use data to inform instruction.  During the interview process, the teacher would asked about the child's schooling while  assessing the student. If the student is in fact a SIFE student, the teacher will then determine what is best for that learner  depending on the amount of schooling received prior. We would introduce and discuss the topic of SIFE's in an ongoing fashion  at staff meetings (who they are, their unique needs, effective strategies to use with SIFE, etc) and answer questions. We  encourage the sharing of ideas on how to make Lighthouse Elementary-PS 106Q especially welcoming to SIFEs. Teachers at PS  106 already use a buddy system for new ELLs by pairing them with advanced or proficient ELLs who speak the newcomer’s first  language. This approach would also be used with SIFEs. The ENL teacher in conjunction with SETSS teacher will make lower  level texts available to teachers of SIFEs to complement grade level texts. The ENL teacher will also conduct ongoing research  on materials (software, texts in first language, assessment tools) that would be useful in working with SIFEs. For example, we  identify and make contact with companies that publish bilingual textbooks in different languages. We can add to our library  textbooks in Spanish (and other languages) at the different grade levels. The ENL teacher is also bilingual and can provide  initial instruction in first language (L1) to Spanish speaking SIFEs’. (Given the large number of Spanish speaking ELL's in our  school, it is safe to assume that the majority of SIFE's attending our school would be Spanish speaking. The ENL teacher would  also initiate contact with staff at DOE's interpreting service unit to identify appropriate staff who speak the SIFE's first language  (L1) if they are not Spanish speaking. We would contact schools in our area that are already servicing SIFEs to learn from their  experiences and possibly secure additional resources.  B.  Newcomer ELLs are given simpler tasks to note for comprehension.  They may be asked to show their understanding in a variety of ways such as oral, writing, TPR and captioning.   There will be  constant opportunity for the newcomers to voice their opinions and share their ideas.  Newcomer ELLs are further supported  in their native language often accompanied by a visual support.  We will continue to explore and implement new ways to  create an ELL-Friendly environment both inside and outside of the classroom.  One of the ways we will do this is to devote  more of our professional development time (and in more informal meetings i.e. ‘lunch and learn’ to discuss the needs of ELLs  and the kinds of practices that will make our school environment more ELL- Friendly. For example, in learning about the  “Stages of Second Language Development”, teachers will come to understand that it is perfectly normal for an ELL in the  preproduction stage of language development to go through a silent, non-speaking stage, thus the importance of  implementing teaching strategies that allow ELLs to use gestures or movement to show comprehension, or to have choral  rather than individual read-alouds. Of course, we will continue to broaden and build on our teachers’ expertise in the use of  differentiated instruction especially as it pertains to ELLs. During these sessions, teachers will also share their impressions on  how they feel ‘newcomers’ are adjusting and also exchange ideas on how to be more supportive. Content area teachers do   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             68      play close attention to the needs of newcomers. They have also been instrumental in facilitating relationship building between  ELLs and their peers. These efforts will be affirmed and highlighted in more formal ways to inspire others to do the same and  to continue the practice.  We will also explore ways of increasing the involvement of parents of ELLs who are new to our  school.  Although language (and at times cultural differences) tend to inhibit some parents, we are looking at ways to  encourage involvement that would not require a lot of verbal communication. We will also look into obtaining more materials  (pamphlets, brochures with subjects of interest) in the language spoken by our ELLs’ parents. Where possible, we will also try  to facilitate relationship by building a ‘buddy system’ between the new parent and parent from the same country who is more  experienced and also bilingual. The ENL Teacher along with the guidance counselor and parent coordinator will confer on a  more regular basis to assess needs and progress of newcomers, and to schedule special events for ELLs i.e. welcome luncheon,  ELLs club (support group), promoting cultural sensitivity in the school.     In order to prepare for ELA testing (which is now  required after 1st year), we will devote at least 2 periods per week on test preparation, i.e. teach test specific vocabulary,  model test taking strategies, use texts from sample tests to teach language usage, editing and reading comprehension,  develop and expand students vocabulary with weekly lists to memorize and weekly tests, build reading stamina by assigning  weekly reading assignments.C.  Developing ELLs who have been receiving ENL services at our school for 4-6 years are usually  well adjusted to academic life and able to perform at or above grade level. Nevertheless, they need to be closely monitored.  Ongoing support is critical. Some of these ELLs at times find themselves unable to get beyond certain levels of proficiency. We  must identify our students’ "blind spots" areas where fossilization of incorrect language usage has occurred in speaking and/or  writing. To this end, the school will continue to procure assessment tools (especially those geared for ELLs) that enable us to  pinpoint more accurately ELLs' areas of need, and also help to develop appropriate action plans.  Content area teachers will  expand their usage of ELL related resources and materials that are provided during professional development, as well as  strategies specifically designed for ELLs that are suggested in our Teacher’s editions.  Experienced ELLs are a great resource  and have a lot to offer newcomers to our school. Even though, they have been tapped in the past to help newcomers, a more  concentrated effort will be made to have ELLs partner with newcomers to share their hard earned wisdom and knowledge. In  addition, ELL students will be asked to further comprehend by expanding their simple sentences and adding details.  They will  be given a less simplified graphic organizer that the newcomer ELL's will use as a stepping stone as they acquire language skills  that will allow for them to also work on the graphic organizers provided to the general education students.D.   For long term  ELL's, we will continue to pay close attention to ELL's who have had to stay beyond the maximum six years with us due to  repeating a grade. In these cases, the school will take a more comprehensive approach to instruction. We will provide time for  our Inquiry Team to conduct 'case' study meetings to evaluate student's progress and needs holistically. Where relevant, we  explore pertinent aspects of student's life including: conditions in the home, social skills, relationship with peers, academic  needs, behavior, developmental issues, etc. We will attempt to ascertain/uncover any needs or problems that may be  impacting progress that has not been previously addressed. It may simply be the need for a more data analysis, or the team  could determine that a more formal evaluation is needed, and recommend such. From this meeting(s), an action plan will be  developed to address the needs that have been assessed and to provide ongoing help and assessment to the student. Follow  up meetings will be held to discuss progress or any further obstacles to progress. Depending on their weaknesses, they will be  given extra questioning sheets, prompts and have some of the opportunities that the newcomer ELLs have while  differentiating.  E. The ENL teachers will give Former ELLs content area services. She will be give students extra questioning  sheets along with content areas strategies/skills sheets and discussions. Text feature skills will help former ELLs be able to  further problem solve and deepen their thinking. Read-alouds are used to help with all language learners.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Scaffolding, visuals (technology and pictures/images) and graphic organizers are the primary instructional strategies used  when teaching ELL-SWDs.  These strategies activate various paths of prior-knowledge which will make comprehension and  input much easier. Graphic organizers will help students be able to gather and organize their thoughts, which may present a  difficult task for many ELL-SWDs. Close reading strategies are used, for example, an ELL-SWD with limited decoding skills listens  to a specific vocabulary word from an academic text. Without seeing the actual spelling of the word, the student is asked to  locate the word in the text using what limited decoding skills they have (ie recognizing beginning and possibly ending sounds)  to spot the desired vocabulary word. Using a Learning Experience Approach, students are encouraged to write short sentences  related to an experience in class, or to self evaluate a lesson (what was easy, what was difficult, etc), student is also  encouraged to write journal type entries. Graphic organizers as mentioned before, are even more critical for ELL-SWDs as one   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             69      of the tools in scaffolding instruction, as well as word walls and manipulatives (ie math). Likewise, the use of Total Physical  Response to help aid retention and to facilitate learning for bodily- kinesthetic learners is also utilized when possible. Imagine  Learning, along with Reading A-to-Z are also used to provide students with support on targeted skills in English, and their  native language.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The ENL teacher attends the student's IEP meetings to be informed about the student's goals.  The student's classroom teacher  along with the ENL teacher discuss plans and scaffolds for the students learning.  Collaboration between the teachers will help  allow for a more successful attainment of the student's IEP goal. The ENL Teacher also maintains copies of ELL-SWD's IEPs to  target instructional goals listed. Scheduling is coordinated with Special Education Teacher as well as Occupational and Speech  teachers to insure that ELLs do not miss mandated instruction. All staff work together to prioritize instructional needs in order  to assist ELL-SWDs to move up proficiency levels and test out.  The instructional strategies and grade-level materials that teachers of ELL-SWDs use that provide access to academic content  and accelerate English language development include speech translation through the Google Translation Link, BrainPOP,  interactive templates for spiral review through the use of games like Jeopardy or Millionaire. Use of an Interactive Smartboard  will not only reinforce academic concepts, but provide students with a way to cater to their individual learning styles and  learning modalities.  Many of the technological methods and strategies  can align with students I.E.P. goals /  modifications.  The TPR Strategy is another way to accelerate English language development through acting out stories or  singing and dancing to songs that relate to the Science and Social Studies curriculum or focuses on their native language and  culture.  Classroom teachers use a variety of instructional techniques, including direct instruction, indirect instruction, and  experiential learning in order to support students. Using the workshop model, ELL-SWDs are given the opportunity to access  grade level appropriate content, while independently practicing relevant skills and strategies. Differentiated instruction also  occurs as a standard part of our instructional day, and students are provided with the opportunity to work with their peers and  in small groups. In addition, all of our early childhood classrooms are rich with language opportunities for students through the  availability of anchor charts, sentence starters and text prompts.           8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  We currently use LLI to target literacy in English. We monitor all of our students’ progress through the Fountas and Pinnell  leveled reading system. The ELLs receive additional ELA support through our use of the Core Knowledge Language Arts  curriculum. We also have a fully certified ENL teacher who provides pullout ESL services that supplement the ELA curriculum  and other classroom content. The classroom teachers and the ENL teacher follow a prescribed pacing calendar to ensure that  English language learning is supported in multiple contexts. We use the GoMath curriculum for our math program.  Our ELLs  participate fully in all of our content area programs with the support of their classroom teachers and the ENL teacher. All  students receive a period of computer technology each week. Computers are also used in every classroom as part of blended  learning instruction. In the mainstream classroom, our ELLs are given access to laptops and ipads to further facilitate their  growth in English.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      The Write Steps program will be implemented in the lower grades to help strengthen writing. In Pre-K, Kindergarten, first and  second grade, the ENL teacher is utilizing Jolly Phonics this year, which emphasizes the letters and their respective sounds as a  way to reinforce the alphabet before introducing sight words, high-frequency words, and word family patterns. The  Expeditionary Learning curriculum has also helped with sounds, and improving reading skills. We also started using a new  online platform called Smarty Ants (K-2), and Achieve 3000 (3-5) and MindPlay to support students with reading skills.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   There have not been any ELL programs/services discontinued.        2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             70      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are all afforded equal access to all school programs. ELLs have access to and take part in all school programs that they are  interested in. Programs are usually presented to ELLs in the general education classes by their general education teachers.  Flyers with enrollment information are sent home for students to sign up if interested. We encourage our ELLs to join our  school community in all the events that we have at our school. In doing so, we also provide flyers in the student's home  language for parents to encourage their participation as well.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Ipads are used for videos and educational learning games on websites such as BrainPoP, starfalls and kidzone. These websites  include interactive content area lessons and games for students to be highly engaged. Teachers use these websites in  conjunction with iReady, to further enhance content skills and to practice comprehension skills. In addition, our students use  Compass Learning, MyOn, Smarty Ants, Achieve3000 and Razkids. For core content areas, Expeditionary Learning is used for all  grades. Go Math is used for math instruction (and can come in other Native languages such as Spanish). For Social Studies we  use "Passport to Social Studies", and for writing "Write Steps!" is used to support ENL students.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?     Our program is only a freestanding ENL program. With the  exception of the Spanish LAB, all subsequent evaluations are  doneexclusively in English. However, native language support is  delivered in our Freestanding ENL Program by having  literature available to the   students in their home languages in both the classroom and the library.  The use of Google  Translation web sites and   other translation web sites such as Reading A - Z help translate  information/stories to the student's  home language. Students may also respond   in their home language both orally and written as needed. Imagine Learning also  supports students as they get instruction in both English, and their native language.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Required services support and resources correspond with ELL's ages and grade levels by having students grouped according to  their corresponding age level, and are given the opportunity to collaborate and work with their peers as much as possible.  Related service providers group students based on both age and ability level, in order to maximize instructional time with  students. Related service providers also interact with the classroom teachers to further support and check on student’s  development.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Activities that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year are ongoing orientations to support parents of  new ELLs. The guidance counselor and parent coordinator provide resources to staff regarding the transition from elementary  school to middle school. They also hold meetings where they speak to the staff regarding the transition and ways to help their  students cope.  The parent coordinator assists the staff to understand any parent concerns and scenarios as to what may be  going on in the household during this time based on past years parent's feedback. Year round the guidance counselor helps 5th  grade teachers begin to implement strategies which will gradually help students become ready for middle school.  Professional  development is also provided by administration.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    There are currently no language electives offered to ELLs.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             71         a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?                  Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ENL teacher will be sent to the Borough Field Support Center development meetings and training. The teacher will also  receive support from the Borough Field Support ELL specialist.  In addition, the teacher will be sent to trainings posted on the  DELLS Opportunities and resources page. The ENL teacher will also be able to seek out any other approved ELL training that  they may come across and feel as if it would enhance their pedagogy and overall development as a teacher.Teachers of ELLs  are a part of a part of Monday's professional learning time where teacher teams and other professional development  opportunities occur.  During the teacher teams, the teachers discuss lessons relating to the common core learning standards.  Various content area professional development training  regarding the Core Knowledge, Expeditionary Learning,  ELA  modalities and other content areas will also be attended to help the ENL teacher become familiar with the standards.  Professional development for non-pedagogic staff will be turn keyed by the ENL teacher/liaison. A bi-monthly ENL Newsletter  is given out, along with PD's that contain useful information for supporting ENL students.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As mentioned above, the school will be sending the ENL teacher out to various specific ELL professional development  opportunities along with seeking support from the Borough Field Support Specialist.  As the teachers attend these various  professional development opportunities, this information will be turn keyed to all teachers in the school. Both agendas along  with attendance will be kept. In order to foster collaboration between our classroom teachers and our ENL teacher,  the  professional development conferences we sign our teachers up for are dedicated to language acquisition and a focus on best  practices for co-teaching strategies and how to better integrate language and content instruction for ELLs. Our ENL teacher  also attends professional development that speaks to language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction. We  also send our ENL teacher to conferences that may focus on co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content  instruction for ELLs so that they can be properly supported within the content area instruction. The school secretary registers  all teachers for the professional workshops and these are recorded in a Black Binder in the Main Office .  In addition, there are  agendas and sign-in sheets that have to be provided at the conference itself and also copied for the school secretary so that a  current log of PD hours can be properly kept.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?    2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             72              The ENL teacher will use her parent engagement time as an opportunity to meet with parents.  If parents are unavailable to  come in at that particular time, the teacher may use her prep as another possible time to meet. The teacher will also be  available to speak with parents through the phone if extenuating circumstancing do not allow for a meeting. If Spanish  translation is needed, ENL teacher will be able to have the conversation in Spanish using a colleague or the translation  services.  However, if there are other languages that need to be translated, the DOE translation service will be used. The goals  of the program, language development process, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in  all content areas are discussed with parents of ELLS by using either the most current NYSITELL or NYSESLAT exam scores. The  ENL teacher will explain the breakdown of the 4 modalities to the parents and how they scored their overall language level.  The teacher will also show work from the students portfolio.Parents are also updated on their child's progress because  monthly progress reports are sent home.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  The various types of parental involvement include student monthly progress reports, parent workshops, the Lighthouse Café,  holiday celebrations, flyers, newsletters, parent meetings and phone calls. We also have a winter, and spring concert that  parents attend. We also have an end of year celebration every year known as the "June Festival" that parents also attend.     Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Rachelle Legions, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             74                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S.106Q - Lighthouse Elementa                                                                              School DBN: 27Q106  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The HLIS, interview and language form are taken into account when assessing the language preferences of the  parent community. In addition over 90 % of our ELL population has a home language of Spanish. Therefore, after  taking into account all of these factors, it has been determined that Spanish is the preferred language preference  of the ELL parent community. The parent coordinator is also able to translate documents to go home to parents.  Emergency contact cards are both in English and Spanish. Letters from the school are also sent home in Spanish  and English.           2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             76     2.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of a school emergency, the Building Response Team will work along with the Parent Coordinator to make  outreach to families with limited -English Proficiency. This will be done through "auto-calls" in their language and  through direct phone calls from the Translation Unit. In addition, the school website will be updated to reflect the  emergency information to be communicated to parents in their native language.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.         2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             78      A meeting will be held with staff on language access or outreach.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      In addition to the requirements above, we will be sending out information to parents regarding the availability of  translation services. The LEP parents will be distributed with the brochure “Parents Guide to Language Access”. They  will also be given a copy of “Parent’s Bill of Rights."          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       During PTA meetings, holiday/school celebrations, Parent Teacher Conferences and other parent meetings surveys  will be given on both paper and orally. The Parent Coordinator and teachers will also take note of and store any other  parent feedback in order to develop next steps for servicing our parent community..          2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             79
