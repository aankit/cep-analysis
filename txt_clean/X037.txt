This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The Vision of our school states as follows:    Section 4: CEP Overview      "We strive to create a learning community that values cultural and linguistic diversity, a climate of collegiality,  kindness and respect, and is accountable to the individual learning style and ability of every member of our school.  We envision a place where students are actively engaged in academically rigorous activities that will allow them to  discover new learning experiences that will prepare them for real life applications. As lifelong learners we will commit  to grow and develop appropriate practices that are meaningful, challenging, and creative. We will strive to constantly   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      examine, authentically assess, and reflect on our work to improve our pedagogy that will lead to student success." We  feel strongly that this vision fits well with the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, and that we share in the  values designed in the framework.     We made the most growth in the previous school year improving the rigorous instruction in all of our classes. Unit  plans and lesson plans were scrutinized to analyze student’s tasks to raise the rigor in daily instruction. Teachers  worked alone and in teacher teams with consultants, coaches, and administration to identify best practices and  implement them in our classrooms on a daily basis. A focus was initiated to analyze and maximize instructional time in  all our classrooms, especially in our self-contained special needs classes, and our clusters. The key area for school  improvement this year will all be around our specific instructional focus. Our focus is as follows: We will provide all  students with an engaging, coherent curriculum that embeds quality instructional tasks, and teachers will refine how  they teach reading and writing to reflect the depth and complexity of the Common Core Learning Standards, so  students will develop the critical thinking and communication skills necessary, resulting in an increase In English  Language Arts student achievement, as measured by running records, writing data, performance tasks, and state test  performance. Many of our key initiatives this year will be under the umbrella of our instructional focus, and will  include targeted small group instruction with the use of educational technology, and careful examination of the  teaching learning process by observing lessons,providing feedback, and participating in worthwhile teacher team  meetings. Our cycles of professional learning will also incorporate the key components of our instructional focus, as  well as including new initiatives such as reciprocal teaching, advanced Literacy, and improving the social emotional  learning of our students and adults.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    We enjoy partnerships with key community based organizations including Literacy Inc., Children's Arts and Science  Workshop, and the Marble Hill community center. We also have a strong partnership with Community Word Group to  work on poetry and dramatic writing. These partnerships take place both during the school day, and after school to  bring innovative programs and opportunities to our school. We retain a well-trained staff of dedicated teachers that  strive to make data driven strategic decisions to spur student achievement. We are excited to offer Regents classes to  our 8th grade students in both Science and Math to allow them to earn high school credit while here, and have a leg  up on the next part of their academic career after graduation. We strive to integrate the arts into our classes during  and after school, as well as expose students to trips and outside performances that will give them an appreciation for  the arts. We provide extensive academic intervention services during the school day, and in our after school and  Saturday programs to ensure our children have the best chance to succeed. We have integrated technology into all  our instruction using laptops, I pads, and SMART boards and other technologies that help foster our instructional  goals. Programs such as I-Ready and Myon Reading have been integrated into all our classes to individualize the  computer-enhanced instruction so EACH child can make progress, according to their specific instructional levels and  needs. We have two new technology based programs I-Read and I -Lit, which instruct and support our English  language learners, and our students with special needs.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our school, The Multiple Intelligences school was formulated based on the beliefs of Howard Gardner, who believed  children learn by a plurality of capacities, and possess many different intelligences that must be nurtured. We are a  kindergarten through 8th grade school of approximately 650 students, with 25% of our students with IEP's, and 16%  are English Language Learners. We are very proud of our school vision, which was written collaboratively by key  school stakeholders.       4.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     We strive to provide rigorous instruction to all students in our school on a daily basis. We have coaches and  consultants that work with our teachers, individually, and in teacher teams to demonstrate and share best practices  to increase student achievement. We have an extensive academic intervention programs that works to provide small  group instruction to our students in need during the school day, as well as after school, and in our Saturday program.  We have used the Danielson framework to observe teacher performance and provide pertinent feedback for our  teachers to improve their pedagogy. We have used resources to purchase instructional materials, and technology to  help our teacher provide meaningful lessons that increase student engagement. We have implemented the suggested  curricula in Math and English Language Arts provided by the DOE to add rigor and structure to our classrooms. All  these initiatives are supervised by our administration to ensure maximum quality instructional time is in every  classroom.   The implementation of the NYS common core testing program caused our achievement on our state tests to decline,  specifically on the English Language Arts exam. An increase in our NYS ELA test scores will again be our priority focus  for this school year and has been shared with the entire school community to ensure its importance. The data source  we used for this goal is the new Framework for Great Schools Report, our School Quality Guide, our Principal  Performance Review, and our School Quality Review.

We all feel the need at PS/MS 37 to create a culture, and an environment where students feel safe, supported, and  challenged by teachers and peers. We feel strongly that we know our children as individuals, and are knowledgeable  about the specific needs that they have. We strive to be a professional learning organization that focuses on the  education of the whole child in a way that can balance academic rigor with kindness, and even fun. We have a full  time guidance counselor to help support the social emotional needs of our students. She will operate away from the  counseling mandates that our other counselors will address, and she will give students, parents, and teachers support  where needed. We partner with the program directors of our elementary (COMPASS)and middle school (SONYC) after  school programs, to provide experiences those students may not get during the school day. We will continue to stress  our R.E.A.C.H. concept which stands for Respect, Excellence, Attitude, Cooperation, and Harmony. The Framework for  Great Schools Report, and our Quality Review report are the data sources used for this goal. No matter how much we  work to provide a safe environment for our students, they cannot benefit from that environment if they are late or  absent.

Our administration works tirelessly to see that teachers are supported, students are respected and nurtured, and  parents are partners in the comprehensive education of their child. We have received quality scores in this area for  many years, as measured by the teacher, parent and student surveys for our school. Our experienced administration  has over 45 years combined experience working in our school building. We now have several of our former students  as parents in our school, and have had numerous families with multiple siblings over the years, one of the benefits of  a K-8 school. We have experience as instructional leaders and have been present at many valuable professional  learning opportunities both as a participant, and as a facilitator. We finished our third year of using the Danielson  framework to implement the ADVANCE system of teacher observation. Administration went to training over the  Summer on school safety updates, and ADVANCE system changes. We are in our second year of providing quality  professional learning on Monday afternoons to our teachers to enhance their professional practice. Our most recent  Quality Review cited the area of effective school leadership as a strength. Our most recent school quality guide  showed this area as meeting the target.

At PS/MS 37 we want to ensure that parents are partners in the overall education of their children. We want  character education and the love of Literacy to be at the forefront of this partnership. We have made strides in this  initiative, but we have much more work to do in this critical area. We have spoken to parents informally, and in  conjunction with the SLT and PTA, to get ideas on how to best improve parent involvement. In speaking with our  parents they have conveyed that they would like more special events like spelling bees, poetry contests, and other  initiatives to encourage reading and writing. Our parents in both elementary and middle school want assemblies,  sports and cheer leading, spelling bees, and other extracurricular activities that parents can watch and participate in.  We have parents that want to volunteer to come in and read with our students, and help in all other beneficial ways .  Parents also want to come to school as a group and have workshops and meetings that will help them help their  children succeed in school. They would also like to come for classes in such things as ESL, art, and cooking to use our  school as a community hub to learn and enjoy with each other. We have used past survey data to identify the priority  needs of this goal, as well as talking with parents at School Leadership Team meetings, and the results of the Strong  Family - Community Ties section of the Framework for Great Schools Report.

Cycles of professional learning are designed and implemented in all the key areas of instruction. The focus  will always be on the eight components of the Danielson framework so our teachers continue to improve on the  ADVANCE system and morale increases. Study groups and book clubs are encouraged and implemented so groups of  teachers are studying facets of teaching that they deem important for their growth.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teacher teams meet with administration to weigh in on school assessment choices. Assessment resources are  provided to the teachers to compare and contrast different assessment options before school wide decisions are  made. We have both a professional development, and measures of student learning (MOSL) committee that meets to  examine different assessments, and make strategic decisions on what will be most effective. Ongoing professional  learning is provided to use formative assessment results to make strategic decisions in the classroom.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The Multiple Intelligence School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students  The Multiple Intelligences School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. The school will maintain this information.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

The program will run after school from October  nineteenth through the end of March, approximately for 20 weeks, or 40 sessions. The materials  that will be used during the program for both target groups are for ELA: Vocabulary skills  Workbook "Word by Word Basic", Continental's New York ELLs workbook that includes all 4  modalities, and online additional resources that will include reading comprehension and writing  activities. Math materials will include Continental workbook "Practice Exercises in Basic Math",  with additional resources. There will be up to twelve (12) students in each class.  There will be  two certified ENL teachers and one foreign language (Spanish) certified teacher. We are targeting  two (2) groups.  The first target group are students who are on an entering or emergent level in grades first through  sixth grade. Most of these students are newcomers that have arrived to the country within the past  school year. Our main goal for this target group is to move at least 30% of the students in this  group to a transitional level by the end of the 2018 - 2019 school year.These students will receive  Math content instruction in their home language (Spanish) by the foreign language teacher. There  are a few (3) students whose home language is not Spanish. These students will receive Math  instruction in English. The ENL teacher will focus on improving student's academic language  development with this target group as well. The four modalities will be implemented in every  lesson, since our entering and emergent students need academic vocabulary acquisition through  explicit instruction.  This will also prepare them for the NYSESLAT, ELA state exam, and Math  state exam.  The second target group will be made up of students in grades 3 through 6 who are on a  transitioning or expanding level, and are long-term ELL students. A few students in this group are  on a transitioning level and the remaining are on an expanding level. Our main goal will be for  30% of this target group to improve by at least one level. Since all the students in this target group  are proficient in speaking, they will receive instruction in listening, reading, and writing. This  group will also receive Math content instruction. Math topics to be taught will include  multiplication, division, solving word problems, and creating graphs, as well as answering  questions that are based on data from different types of graphs. Instruction for this group will be in  English.

Most of our ELLs are recent arrivals therefore this trip will be an  opportunity for them to get familiarized with their surroundings.  The selected students will be  divided into small groups. Each group will focus on one landscape and they will create a  Collaborative Poster together.  Then, they will share their work with the other groups. With this  activity, they will demonstrate all four modalities (listening-to the speaker during the trip, reading- the information of the landscape, speaking-with the group members, and writing-all the  data/information to complete the Collaborative Poster). The trip will take place after  NYSESLAT testing (End of May/Beginning June).

We will provide three workshops to parents. The workshops will be scheduled during  during the first month of school in September. The projected dates are not yet decided. Each  workshop will be one hour. The first workshop will be for ENL parents that do not speak  English. The parents will be following steps on completing a painting that resembles a famous  artist's piece of work (Van Goh's "The Starry Night". The second workshop will be Native  Language Arts for parents that don't speak Spanish. Our foreign language teacher will hold this  workshop and engage parents in activities to learn basic Spanish. The third workshop for parents  will be an introduction to technology for all parents.  During this workshop parents will learn  how to search the internet and research. These workshops will provide refreshments and food for  the parents.      Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  For the early grades, we use the Fountas and Pinnell Literacy assessment. For the middle grades, we use the DRA to determine  literacy skills for all students, including ELLs. The emphasis school-wide for new ELLs is not only on decoding skills, but  comprehension skills and strategies. We use the data from DRA scores to help inform our guided reading programs and  instruction. These assessments allow us to properly group the students for literacy and identify specific skills and strategies  that the students need to improve.  They also inform us of which students may be in need of Reading Recovery for the early  grades, and AIS (Academic Intervention Services) for the middle grades.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   To support instructional planning for ELLs, ENL teachers meet weekly to discuss data findings and student growth. In addition,  ENL teachers meet with classroom teachers and SETSS teachers (Special Education Teacher Support Services) to discuss ELL  students' needs and strategies that they may incorporate into their daily lessons to support ELL students.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The summative assessments being used are baseline, mid-line and end-line writing assessments, end of unit tests, pre-unit  assessments and post-unit assessments. These assessments give data on each students strengths, weaknesses, areas in need  of improvement, and skills and strategies that students need to progress in literacy.          4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once summative data has been gathered and analyzed students that are performing below grade level are placed in AIS for  either ELA or math, or both. In addition, this upcoming school year, an intervention period for each grade will take place daily.  During this intervention period, classroom teachers, ENL teachers, AIS teachers and SETSS teachers will work with students in  small groups for guided reading and small group instruction where they will focus on identified areas of need.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   All ELL students who score level 1 or 2 on the ELA and Math state exams are initially placed in an AIS group where extra  support is given (Wilson Reading program, Math support) to help them improve their skills across the content areas.  This  small group instruction provides them with extra academic support in the needed areas where they struggle the most.  ELLs  are periodically assessed according to their grade level.  Fountas and Pinnel, DRA, City Periodic Assessments and Writing  Diagnostic (baseline, Midline and Endline) for grades K - 8.           6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   To evaluate and inform our ELL program, we use NYSITELL and/or NYSESLAT scores, and ELA state test scores. The data is  gathered and analyzed to identify areas in need and the allotted time for ENL services. The students are then grouped by  proficiency level and abilities.  Modalities are also taken into consideration when grouping students.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teachers share ELL student data (NYSITELL and /or NYSESLAT scores-proficiency levels, allotted time) with the  classroom teachers.             Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   We group our students in several ways. Depending on the required mandated time students are grouped by grade,  proficiency level and mandated minutes required for services.  For our stand alone model, students are grouped by  homogeneous proficiency level. For our integrated model the ENL teachers push into the classroom to service ENL  students.   b.  TBE program.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Our school uses the NYSESLAT data and the new regulations to provide the mandated minutes according to New York  State. All the ENL groups are seen during their allotted times as per CR-Part 154.2 in 45 minute periods. Students are grouped  according to their proficiency level and leveled materials are used with instruction.  Entering level students are serviced within  two groups, one that includes mixed proficiency levels, and one that is mixed grade levels, but same proficiency level to ensure  that they are serviced for the amount of minutes required. Emerging level students will be serviced during four 45 minute  periods by grade level and two 90 minute blocks. Transitioning and expanding students are serviced during four 45 minute  periods, consisting of both pull-out instruction and integrated instruction.  Commanding level students will be serviced during  two 45 minute periods. The classroom teacher delivers ELA instruction using differentiated teaching strategies and materials  to provide ELLs with the appropriate support.   Students’ varying needs are met not only by the ENL teacher, but also by the classroom teachers. All of our classroom teachers  have received training in differentiation of instruction.  To assist newcomers in Mathematics, for example, all efforts are made  to supply materials in the students’ native language (Spanish).  Newcomers and long term ELLS are placed in the Title III ENL  after school and Saturday school programs. All intervention services are provided in English to support students with language  development.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Students receiving ENL services through pull-out instruction are provided with content area instruction in small groups.  All  content area instruction is provided in English with differentiation strategies.  We use non-fiction materials which are aligned  with the CCLS.  During integrated ENL periods, the ENL teachers push into classrooms during content area instruction to  support ELL students.  Teachers use a variety of techniques to make content concepts clear. These techniques include  modeling, hands-on materials, visuals, demos, gestures, and film clips. In addition, meaningful and authentic activities that  allow language practice opportunities are provided to students. Some of these activities include the use of graphic organizers,  study guides, surveys, letter writing, and plays.            The following programs are used across the grades: Ready Gen (Grades K-2) provides a scaffolded strategies handbook,  that includes supports for ELLs. Expeditionary Learning (Grades 3 - 5) provides close reading of several non-fiction  units.  Scholastic Code X (grades 6-8), every unit includes building support for ELLs.  Teachers use authentic literature and  other titles available in the native language as the basis of common core aligned units of study in native language arts  classes.  Go Math (Grades K-5) includes teachers guides and student editions with built in vocabulary support in every unit.  In  addition, each lesson includes differentiation for ELL learners as well as suggestions for instructional strategies for various  levels of student understanding.  Grades 6-8 New York State Education Department Modules are used and every module  includes support for ELLs in the form of embedded teacher notes.  ELL students are also given a peer tutor who speaks their  native language to assist them during area instruction. The general education teachers are provided with supplemental  materials from the ENL teachers to assist in teaching and supporting the ELLs in their classroom.             A  newer method used to foster language development in the classroom is reciprocal teaching.  During reciprocal  teaching, students become the teacher in small group reading sessions. Teachers model for students, then assist students  in learning to guide group discussions using four specific strategies (summarizing, questioning, clarifying and predicting).             4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Students who are first time admits are evaluated in their native language with the NYSITELL in Spanish. Since we do not have  a bilingual program the ELE is not used.  The students who are in the Special Education classes are New York State Alternately  Assessed.  Instruction is provided in English.  The students are trained in using a translated version side by side and are given   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      the option to either complete the test in Spanish or in English.  Most of the students prefer to take the test in English since that  is the language of instruction.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. Instruction is differentiated for SIFE students by providing visuals, diagrams, graphic organizers, sentence starters, leveled  texts, manipulatives and allowing extra time to complete activities.  b. Instruction is differentiated for newcomers by providing visuals, diagrams, graphic organizers, sentence starters, leveled  texts, manipulatives and allowing extra time to complete activities.   c. Instruction is differentiated for Developing level students by providing them with graphic organizers, instructions that are  step-by-step to follow, leveled texts  d. Instruction is differentiated for Long Term ELLs by providing more complex and higher order thinking questions and  activities.  e. Instruction is differentiated for former ELLs by providing more complex and higher order thinking questions and activities.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Instructional strategies that teachers of ELLs use in their classrooms include making lessons visual, making connections to prior  knowledge, modifying vocabulary instruction, and providing them with personal word walls.  The grade-level materials we use  is "Language Power", which provides access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development. In  addition, students are also provided with content instruction through "Time for Kids" articles.   Technology is also used to support ELL students. Teachers use smart-boards during lessons to support with visuals, as well as  making lessons interactive for ELL students. ELL students also use computers to go on to programs to support their progress in  reading and mathematics.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our ELL-SWD's are divided within the school's 6 different special education classrooms.  These six special education classrooms  follow the 12:1:1 special education model and students are serviced as mandated by their IEP recommendations.  All  instruction and scheduling is done within the 12:1:1 setting to accommodate all of their educational support services as they  are mandated to receive Speech, Counseling, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, and Adaptive Physical Education  support services.  Some of these students are mandated to receive a language paraprofessional assisstant to support their  second language acquisition as mandated by their IEP document.  ENL teachers participate in grade level meetings and SBST  meetings to assure that IEP goals are met.  These meetings occur as often as needed.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our Academic Intervention Providers are using a variety of intervention programs to address the specific needs of our ELL  groups which are offered in English.  The ELLs in grades K-2 receive targeted intervention from the Reading Specialist which  uses Ready Gen and Reading Recovery Program that focuses on phonemic awareness, blending, letter sounds, etc. with a  variety of non-fiction books related within the content areas (i.e., Social Studies, Science, and Math).  Grades 3-5 ELLs are  serviced by an English and a bilingual AIS teacher and math providers (enrichment).  The Wilson program used provides  reading strategies, letter sound, fluency building and comprehension. Guided Reading is provided using fiction and non-fiction  texts (Social Studies, Science, and Math).  These programs are provided in English.  AIS teachers for grades 6 - 8 use the Go  Math curriculum that provides technology to assess and analyze student work.  In addition, they use Scholastic Code X which   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      focuses on the Common Core Curriculum which is non-fiction content based (Science, Social Studies, and Math).  It focuses on  writing, comprehension, text support, authors point of view, etc.  Reading is taught through these core subjects.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       Our school is planning to incorporate an intervention period for all grades. The intervention period will consist of one period  per grade per day. During this period all students will be receiving small group instruction from either their classroom teacher,  ENL teacher, AIS teacher, or SETSS teacher.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?    N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELL students are invited to participate in all academic programs offered at PS/MS 37.  ELLs are invited to the ELA and Math test  prep academy.  They are also invited to The Children's Arts and Science Workshop, which is held in our school building daily.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  To support and supplement instruction provided to ENL students, all teachers are provided with an ENL Library/Media Center  in their classroom for use during independent study and/or independent reading.  These areas include CDs, phonics games,  puzzles and flash cards, bilingual and picture dictionaries, trade books, periodical and newspaper activities, computers with  internet capabilities and Smart Boards.  Our licensed computer teacher, as well as the ENL teacher, suggest websites for  interactive listening, speaking, reading and writing activities.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In our ENL program we provide native language support by the ENL teacher in all the content areas to the newcomers or  beginning level students whenever is needed.  The support is given through the use of native language dictionaries, translated  materials for content instruction, native language library and other resource materials.  In addition, we have a Bilingual- Spanish teacher this year who is providing "Spanish" as an elective to grades 5th through 8th as a push-in model.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All required service support and resources correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  Our ENL and classroom instruction is  currently aligned with the Common Core Curriculum that is delivered on a daily basis during instruction.  In our school our ELL  students are instructed based on their grade level and with age-appropriate materials.  If a student is sife (student with  interrupted formal education), the classroom teacher will ensure that instruction is modified to meet the student's academic  needs and/or educational goals.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Since newly enrolled ELL students are identified in the Fall upon registration, once they are identified, the ENL teacher  provides the students with a tour of the school. They are introduced to the Assistant Principal in charge of ELL instruction, the  nurse and other important personnel in the school.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Since we are a K-8 school, we offer Spanish to grades 5th through 8th as an elective.         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our professional development plan for all ELL personnel at our school will be provided in our school and also at ELL  professional development workshops that are held by the district office and other networks affiliated with the ELL  population.  To reach this objective we will continue to support all of our teachers in their growth as pedagogues by providing  them with professional development which focuses on planning for differentiation, using data for instruction, planning for  effort and shared reading groups.  Teachers and all staff are aware of all the data available to them where they can see how  their ELL students are performing in comparison to their English proficient students and also to see the varying degrees of  need in the classroom. Looking at this data also gives them an idea of the linguistic and academic needs of the students.     Teachers of ELLs receive professional development and guidance, as it pertains to ELLs, from both the Assistant Principal and  ENL teachers.  In addition, teachers are provided with resources available to support them in scaffolding curriculum in both  ELA and Math for teaching the fundamentals of language.  During the monthly grade level meeting, teachers are provided with  their ELL student data and strategies are shared for appropriate grouping and selecting supporting materials aligned with the  common core learning standards.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2 for all teachers. The ENL teachers (Ms.  Negron, Ms. Capalbo) meet monthly with classroom teachers to discuss strategies and methods that can be incorporated into  lessons during classroom instructions for ELL students. In order for our ENL teachers to provide professional development for  classroom teachers they attend outside professional development workshops for ELLs.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our school provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language development  progress, language proficiency assessments, and language development needs in all content areas by scheduling individual  meetings that are convenient for parents. Our school's parent coordinator, Lisa Coca, is available for parents who need  translation in Spanish, and provide other accommodations for parents who ae non-Spanish speaking.          2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Our parent coordinator is bilingual (Spanish/English). She provides activities that are hands on for our ELL parents. In addition  they are invited to events and workshops at our school.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53            Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kenneth Petriccione, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Multiple Intelligences                                                                              School DBN: 10x037  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Yes/No    Language Access   Coordinator? Yes/No               * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      During registration, every required document is translated in all languages so that families are clear with the  required expectations of the Department of Education. According to the summary of ELLs students enrollment, 99  parents are Spanish speaking, one Japanese, one Urdu, three Hausa, and two Russian. In order to effectively  communicate with our parents, our parent coordinator attends all trainings offered by the Translation and  Interpretation Unit. All school communication is translated by the Parent Coordinator, the school secretary, and  the ESL teacher from English to Spanish. Also, Languange Interpretation Devices were purchased to use with  incidence languages such as Urdu, Hausa, Russian and Japanese. We use Google translate to provide written  information for our low incident languages. For our oral interpretation needs either the Parent Coordinator, the  school secretary, or the ESL teacher provide this service (Spanish). We also have some staff members who speak  Urdu and Bengali.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57     2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Language    Written  Preferred    Percent  Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    We were able to determine our oral and  written translation needs based on the  HLIS surveys and the Home Language  Report from ATS. These needs were  effectively communicated to the school  community by our Parent Coordinator.  As previously stated based on these  reports the highest need is for Spanish  translations and we are able to meet our  needs with in-house personnel. In  addition to Spanish, parents' preferred  languages include Hausa, Japanese,  Urdu, and Russian.                        3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.               Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      Document Name    Month/Frequency   How do you   Distributed to   Families    plan to   translate?   Include   procedures  to ensure   timely   provision of  translated  documents  to parents.       To assure that our parents are provided with a meaningful  opportunity to participate in and have accesss to programs and  services critical to their children's education we have implemented  the following. During registration, every required document is  translated in all languages so that families are clear with the required  expectations of the Department of Education.
