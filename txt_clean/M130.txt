This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Public School 130 Manhattan, the Hernando De Soto School, fully embraces its vision and mission for PS 130, “  Excellence in Education – Enrichment for all Children.” PS 130 aims to be a diverse and inclusive learning community  of students, families, and educators dedicated to the pursuit of learning and excellence in education. The school is  grounded in the belief that effort creates ability. Every individual has the right to an education that empowers,  shaping society as participatory citizens. We take a whole child approach to education, providing each student with  academic rigor, meaningful experiences, and unique opportunities. All stakeholders strive to maintain a school culture  rooted in hard work, respect, and responsibility, made possible by a positive, safe, and nurturing environment. We   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      support the potential for growth and success in each and every member of our community. PS 130 has a tremendous  team working together for our students, as we have a very supportive administration, colleagues, and parent body.          2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 130 is located right in the heart of Chinatown and Little Italy. One of the first things people often ask is, “How do  you get there?” There are numerous ways, as there are trains that go to Canal Street and Grand Street and buses that  go to Bowery Street and Centre Street. Just as there are numerous ways of physically getting to PS 130, when it comes  to educating our students, we’ve come to realize that there are many ways of reaching our students, in order to  ensure they receive the best education that we can deliver. Not only do we provide our inquisitive young minds with  strong academics and a rigorous curriculum, but we also believe in enriching and inspiring them with the arts through  music, dance, and the visual arts. We have arts programs at every grade level from Pre-Kindergarten to the Fifth  Grade, through partnerships with organizations such as National Dance Institute, Inside Broadway, The 3rd Street  Music School, Rosie's Theater Kids, and Dancing Classrooms. They provide an immense learning experience for all of  our students, as the arts instill confidence, self-discipline, hard work, and pride. We also have a school Lion Dance  Club that studies this traditional Chinese dance, and performs for the neighborhood's Lunar New Year Parade and  other activities throughout the year. Some of our students who struggle academically really shine when it comes to  the arts. Often, the confidence and discipline that students gain from the arts can carry over and create a more  positive attitude in their academic learning. We have also pushed to integrate technology into our learning, both for  our students and our staff.    We are a Title I school, and in terms of our student body makeup, about 87.27% of our students are Asian, 5.61%  Hispanic, 2.8% White, 0.82% Black, 0.12% American Indian or Alaskan Native, and 3.39% multi-racial. It is important to  us that all students see themselves represented in the school experience and curriculum, and have exposure to other  cultures. In this, our arts programs also play a critical role, as students study the music, dance, and history of many  ethnic groups and nations. For instance, National Dance Institute focuses around an annual theme, some of which  have recently included Harlem, China, Africa, Stevie Wonder, Rivers, and Advocacy. Our Dancing Classrooms  Partnership exposes students to some of the traditional dances of South America, Western Europe, and North  America. Finally, many of our students had the opportunity to perform onstage at the historic Apollo Theater in  Harlem last year, with both Young People's Chorus and our in-house vocal group, the Voices of 130.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Even though 16% of our student population is labeled as Limited English Proficient (based on NYSESLAT achievement),  over 60% of our students come from homes where English is not the primary language. Therefore, our students still  need a significant amount of language and literacy support in the classroom. Our ENL service providers work in both a  push-in and pull-out model, depending upon the needs of students in the class.    This year, we also have one ICT classroom on every grade level, from K-5. Opening ICT classes has allowed for us to  increase the time that our SWD population spends in the classroom with general education peers, because they can  be supported by a special education teacher in the classroom rather than leaving the room for SETSS. Of course, the  needs of our SWD population are very diverse: some require only academic support, while others benefit from related  services and counseling.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   This past school year, we made the most progress in the element of Rigorous Instruction. A review of the progress  report data and state and city assessment reports of our lowest third population indicates that many of these  students had been previous ELLs with learning challenges. We incorporated the writing units from the Teachers'  College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP), and saw notable gains in student achievement across all grade levels   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      and subgroups. In terms of State Accountability, our school has been designated as a Reward School each year since  School Year 2014-15, based on student achievement and progress.   With higher expectations and more rigorous learning standards, continued support for former ELLs is evidently  needed as well as differentiated instructional practices to address their challenges. This year, our professional  development is focused around fully incorporating the TCRWP curriculum in both reading and writing. We are  including our SETSS and ENL providers in this work so that they will be able to better support student learning and  achievement. We are focusing on increasing collaboration amongst teachers, as the TCRWP professional development  centers around "lab sites" and classroom intervisitations. Finally, we now have one lower grade teacher designated as  a NYC "Model Teacher", and an upper-grade teacher designated as a NYC "Peer Collaborative Teacher", as well as an  in-house literacy coach who has been a teacher at PS 130 for over 17 years. We anticipate that these structures and  new roles will help to support teachers as they fully take on a rigorous new curriculum.

With our commitment to working to improve the performance of all of our students, including our students with  special needs and our English Language Learners, we understand the need to monitor student progress for each child  throughout the year.    Based on the 2018 NYS Assessment Data for all Grades (3, 4, 5), 82% of our students achieved a Level 3 or 4 in ELA,  and 88% of our students achieved a Level 3 or 4 in Math. Our goal is to continue our “Exceeding Target” in our School  Quality Guide in terms of student progress and student achievement.   Following our most recent Principal Performance Review (PPR), both our Superintendent and Deputy Superintendent  strongly suggested that we fully implement the Teachers' College Reading and Writing Project Curriculum as a way to  reach all learners and to ensure instruction is both rigorous and differentiated enough to meet the needs of all  learners.

Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible  for implementation and oversight.  Teachers will provide parent classroom orientations for every grade (PreK-5) in September to inform parents of  expectations and curriculum. Teachers will have ongoing communication with parents to inform them about  classroom instruction. Some of this communication includes classroom newsletters with images of exemplars and  student work samples, as well as communicating unit goals and target skills. Many teachers also send home "book  marks" for students that indicate their personal reading levels and goals with high-leverage skills and strategies to  work on in order to move onto the next text band. Administrators maintain an "open door" policy to meet with  parents who have questions or are concerned about how to help their children at home. Finally, feedback on  homework is a way that many teachers can quickly and consistently communicate with parents about what their child  is doing well, and what they could do to improve.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  In order to fulfill our mission statement of "Excellence in Education" and "Enrichment for all Children," and continue  building on the success of this philosophy, we need to ensure that all of our students continue to participate in the  arts programs that we offer. Through parent participation and collaboration with cultural organizations that are  facilitated by our Arts Coordinator, students are able to demonstrate and showcase their enthusiasm for learning to  their peers and the greater school community.   The arts education goal for the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is to “provide all public school  students with universal access to a high quality arts education. Fulfillment of this mission will lead students to  discover the lifelong enjoyment and wonder inherent in dance, music, theater, and visual arts.” We believe that  involvement in the arts enriches student learning across the curriculum and facilitates the establishment of a positive  and supportive school culture where students feel safe and supported. The arts help students develop their ability to  express themselves and build skills and knowledge in a diversity of forms. We believe that our strong commitment to  the arts contributes to our success.   According to our 2016-2017 School Quality Snapshot, our student attendance rate was 98%. We believe that greater  enjoyment and engagement in school leads to this high level of attendance. 94% of responding parents indicated that  the school offered enough extracurricular programs to keep their child interested in school, and we earned a score of  "Excellent" in the metric of Supportive Environment. Finally, we feel that our strong attendance rate, engagement in  school activities, and differentiated teaching contributed to our score of "Excellent" in "Closing the Learning Gap" for  our SWD population.    As indicated in our 2014-15 Quality Review, “High expectations are communicated through verbal and written school- wide systems support a rigorous learning environment where accountability is reciprocal among all members of the  community that focus on a culture of college and career readiness.”         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, 100% of students in Pre-K to 5 will have participated in the performing arts, visual arts, or music in  order to develop their creativity and flourish in a safe and supportive environment, and students will continue to  meet or exceed our current performance levels in English Language Arts (ELA) and Math. We will keep track of this by  conducting grade meetings and ensuring each class has agreed to participate in the arts through sign-up sheets and  through our Arts Coordinator working with all of our classes and partnerships.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

In order to achieve continual improvement in best teaching practices and student learning, teachers need to engage  collaboratively in sustained professional learning, using an inquiry approach that promotes shared leadership and  focuses on improved student learning. Teachers and educators need to reflect on professional practice, collaborate  and share ideas, and set learning targets so that students can achieve academic success. As a school, we work towards  building teacher capacity and building upon best practices. Our school has an in-house literacy coach, who meets with  teachers (either on a sign-up basis or based on classroom visitations/supervisor feedback) to plan for instruction and  to monitor student data. This year we have also added a Model Teacher and Peer Collaborative Teacher with the goal  of increasing opportunities for classroom intervisitations and peer learning.    In terms of The Framework for Great Schools, schools need to engage in cycles of learning in order to support student  learning and improve teaching. Last year, 100% of our teachers participated in at least two Cycles of Learning with  colleagues, engaging in a self-selected area of professional study.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34        Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S 130, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 130 Manhattan will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

We anticipate that there will be a total of  90 ELLs served. We believe that small group instruction will support with targeting the specific  needs of our ELLs, which is in alignment with the school's current instructional focus of  ensuring that instruction is rigorous through the development and implementation of a  responsive, cohesive curriculum that is data-driven, inclusive, and engaging.   ELL students in Grades 3-5 will meet once a week on Thursdays from 2:45pm - 4:15pm from  approximately the middle of November through March (about 15 sessions).  They will be  organized into groups as follows: one group for Grade 3/4 entering/emerging students: one group  for Grade 3/4 transitioning/expanding students; one group for Grade 5 entering/emerging  students; and one group for Grade 5 transitioning/expanding students - a total of 4 groups, each  in its own classroom with no more than 12 students per group, and taught by ENL-certified  teachers who will provide targeted instruction in English Language Arts (Reading, Writing,  Listening, and Speaking). Students' placement into groups will be determined by most recent  language proficiency levels (as per analysis of the 2018 NYSESLAT results).  In addition to  the NYSESLAT data, students' current F&P independent reading levels, state ELA exam results  (identifying those ELL students who scored lower than a level 3 on the state ELA test), class  work, and teacher observations will also be considered when addressing students' needs through  carefully planned lessons and activities.   ELLs in Grades 1 and 2 will meet once a week on Wednesdays from 2:45pm - 4:15pm from  January through mid-May (about 14 sessions). There will be approximately 8 groups, with no  more than 10 students in each group. Students at the entering/emerging levels in grades 1 and 2  will be placed in one group, and there will be several groups (separated by Grade 1 & 2) of  students at the transitioning/expanding level. Each group will be in its own classroom and  supported by an ENL-certified teacher for enrichment and targeted instruction in literacy. All  ELLs will be invited to participate in this program; teachers in the program will collaborate with  the ELL's day-time classroom teachers to access & analyze  data (NYSESLAT, F&P  independent reading levels, class work and observations).   Student goals will be determined by use of the New Language Arts progressions and Common- Core expectations, in alignment with students' current English proficiency level, independent  reading level, and feedback from classroom teachers.  All ENL teachers will be appropriately  State Certified in ENL.  Teachers will be using a Balanced Literacy Approach, where teachers  will support the group through shared readings, guided reading, and writing, along with listening  and speaking through questioning and discussion.  Instruction will be given in English, with  home language support provided when needed. (Bilingual texts in Chinese and English, ordered  through ChinaSprout, will be made available to support vocabulary acquisition and reading  comprehension.) The trade books (fiction and non-fiction) that are used (via ChinaSprout and  Scholastic) will help teachers model strategies to help students make connections between  literary and informational texts, reader and text, vocabulary and text, and the various themes  presented in the text. All of this works towards helping our ELLs with increasing their academic  vocabulary and building up their reading comprehension. Authentic literature (read-alouds   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   and book sets) will help familiarize students with language, vocabulary, and author's  purpose.  Fiction and nonfiction reading materials and the use of accountable talk will help our  ELLs develop their speaking and listening skills.  Bilingual dictionaries will also be purchased to  support students' vocabulary development and language usage.  Take-home listening aids (audio books and CDs purchased through Lakeshore Learning) will be  made available for students along with online subscription resources (Time4Kids, Scholastic  News, Reading A-Z, Discovery Education, BrainPop) to continue strengthening their listening  comprehension skills outside of school. Use of technology resources and collaborative games  will also support with enhancing students' literacy abilities. Common-Core ELA kits were  purchased (via Learning Resources) as the main source of materials for this program. These kits  contain a variety of resources (games, vocabulary activities, picture supports, comprehension  boards, writing prompt cards, etc.) that will aid teachers in providing students the necessary  content and strategies in multiple ways, and enable students to experience language through a  variety of rich and engaging avenues. These kits will serve as supplemental materials that are  distinct from those used for daily instruction.  We will also have a 5-hour, one-day Saturday Institute on March 23 (9:00am - 2:00pm) to give  our 4th grade ELLs additional exposure to literacy.  Approximately 20 students will receive  targeted coaching in small groups (10 students per group) by 2 ENL teachers  to  develop academic English literacy strategies and skills  identified as areas of need by their  classroom teachers, based on classroom assessments and teacher observations.

As the school has recently adopted the Teacher's  College Reading & Writing Project as its new literacy curriculum, the focus of these sessions  will be to create language objectives and incorporate ENL strategies into TC Units of Study in  both reading and writing across grades K-5 to best meet the needs of ELLs. The 4 sessions will  be facilitated by the two assigned TC staff developers (one for K-2, one for 3-5); also available  to support will be Assistant Principal, Beena Thomas, who has experience in working with large  ELL populations and has completed Fordham University's TESOL Institute, along with the  school's in-house literacy coach, Danielle Cannistraci and the two knowledgeable, experienced  ENL/AIS staff members, Judy King-Hui and Kathy Kwong. (11/27: Advanced Literacies; 1/29:  TCRWP - Language Objectives and differentiating for ELLs; 3/26: Writing; 5/28: Vocabulary &  Content-Focused Instruction).    The teachers who are working the Extended School Day program on Wednesdays and Thursdays  will be invited to participate in an ELL book study Professional Learning community,  to be  facilitated by Assistant Principal Beena Thomas. Title III teachers would be invited to participate  (paid per session) in five or six after school meetings on Fridays from 2:45-4:15pm in January- February (1/11, 1/18, 1/25, 2/1, 2/8 and possibly 2/15).

Participants will be able to voice their preference of text, and  the book to be studied will be selected based on coming to a consensus around a common need.  Findings from this PLC will be shared by Title III teachers via the school's weekly school e- newsletter and/or presented during a Monday PD session to the entire staff (either February 25 or  March 4).    Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

Our two ENL service providers  (Judy King-Hui & Kathy Kwong), all of whom speak the native language of many families, will  support with delivering this content to the parent audience. Topics will focus on both literacy and  math; the first meeting(January 17, 8:45 - 9:45am) will address the topics of using visual  supports, vocabulary acquisition, and questioning and discussion, and reading strategies, and the  second meeting (April 11, 8:45 - 9:45am) will deal with problem-solving in math, mathematical  practice standards, test-taking strategies and tips, and social-emotional learning. We also provide  time for parents to ask questions about school curriculum. Translators are provided at these  meetings.   All notifications to parents are sent via backpack in English/Chinese or English/Spanish  throughout the year. Parents will be surveyed in November (during Parent-teacher conference  days) for their preferences of topics they would be interested in attending workshops  for. Workshops for ELL parents will be coordinated by the Parent Coordinator, Diane Chong and  planned for the following school year..   Our Parent Coordinator is working with the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center so that  we can host parent workshops.  We are planning on holding an hour-long workshop (during the  school day) on ADHD and Student Focus in November and another one on Behavior  Management in February.  Translators will be available at these parent workshops. These  workshops are planned in collaboration with the Parent Association and will be provided at no  cost to the program.   At all meetings and workshops, attendance will be taken, agendas will be distributed, and all  materials will be available in both English and Chinese (Spanish also, if needed). Copies will be  maintained in a binder by our ELL coordinator/ENL service providers.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use the Fountas and Pinnell (F&P) assessment system (running records, comprehension), NYC Performance Tasks, and  teacher-made assessments to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs.  We have found that our systematic approach to  teaching literacy and language to our ELLs through a blend of ENL and Balanced Literacy has enabled our ELLs to acquire  English language skills very quickly.  Most students enter with limited or no English language skills and have an F&P  independent reading level that is barely recordable (-A).  By the end of the year, most of our young ELLs have reached F&P  independent reading levels comparable to their English proficient peers (levels C-E).      Teachers use the data gathered from assessments (F&P, running records, baseline tasks, end-of-unit performance tasks,  writing pieces) to inform their instructional planning of unit goals, specific lessons, small groups, and individual student goals.  These forms of assessment data have helped teachers provide targeted, Common Core-aligned instruction to students to meet  their unique needs and monitor their progress throughout the school year.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   This year, we implemented a Title III ENL after-school program for ELLs in grades 1 and 2 as a way of providing these students  with additional, targeted language support and strengthening their skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Enhancing  these specific skills was a goal in preparation for the NYSESLAT, as well as supporting their growth in independent reading.     While our older ELLs tend to progress well, it does take them a little more time to reach the standards of the grade they are  attending, particularly in reading and writing.  For this reason, we are providing consistent support throughout the year for all  of our ELLs on grades 3-5 in an extended school day program, with a focus on reading and writing as well as opportunities to  “rehearse” their listening and speaking skills through our performing arts program offerings throughout the grades.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs by how well our ELLs transition into the mainstream.  This is measured  through teacher evaluation and an assortment of assessments (both formal and informal), parent feedback and student  reflections and presentations.        In addition, we track all of our ELL students' progress by monitoring their F&P reading levels and writing samples, as well as  keeping portfolios for their content area instruction. We administer the NYC ELA and MATH Performance Tasks and the ELL  Periodic Assessment at the beginning and end of year to monitor students' progress. On our most recent School Quality Guide  (2015-16),  the average proficiency rating of ELLs in the "Closing the Achievement Gap Metrics" was meeting targets in ELA and  exceeding targets in MATH.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Teachers meet in their grade teams to look at the summative assessments & corresponding rubrics to then norm their scoring  practices. Once assessments have been graded, all data is entered into our school-based Google monitoring documents. The  beginning-of-year assessment data gives teachers a snapshot of their students' strengths and areas of need, which supports  the formation of small groups and the planning of targeted instruction. Throughout the year, as teachers monitor growth via  running records, pre- and post-unit assessments, etc. instruction and small groups are adjusted accordingly. Those students  who are found to be making minimal to no progress are referred to the coach, ENL teachers and members of the RTI team,  who analyze student work and current instructional strategies and make suggestions for remediation and additional support.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   We use teacher-created assessments, teacher observations and conferring notes as well as F&P results to guide instruction for  ELLs. Teachers meet together with their ENL support teachers to analyze results - identify which ELLs continue to struggle  academically (e.g. low scores on unit assessments and writing tasks, showing little to no progress in moving up F&P levels, etc.)  and to determine steps to take as per the RTI framework in the following manner:     - Tier I - Classroom:  Explicit instruction based on NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, and F&P assessment results with a differentiation in  content and product, a focus on oral language development and supporting literacy skills and content knowledge all year long  through pairs, small groups, buddy/partnerships;  addressing all modalities (listening/speaking, reading/writing) throughout  the day; conducting on-going assessments (such as observations of students, running records, conferencing, etc.).     - Tier 2 - Targeted Instruction based on language needs of students in a small group with knowledgeable/certified school  personnel (group size should be no more than 1:6 or 1:8).  Remediation of skills/strategies daily.  If students are still struggling,  we will look at the students' background, strengths, and weaknesses, home environment, and note behaviors associated with  a learning disability and behaviors associated with language acquisition for a second language.  Assessments at this tier will  also include the Wilson reading system. RTI teachers will consult with classroom teachers to discuss data and plan next steps.     - Tier 3 - Individual Intensive Intervention is given in groups of 1:1 or 1:2.  Student progress is monitored more frequently   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         (about once every 2 weeks).  If the ELL continues to struggle (as indicated by data monitoring and analysis of student work), a  referral may be necessary.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Our ELLs are making fair progress by making movement from one proficiency level to the next. The NYSITELL and NYSESLAT  data indicate that many of our students are able to achieve results at the Expanding and Commanding levels in the earlier  grades (K-3) - this confirms the value we place on strong literacy support in all grades, particularly in establishing a literacy  foundation as early as possible.  Close analysis of the ELL subgroup's performance on the State ELA & MATH exams enables us to determine targeted supports  for ELLs in literacy and math, e.g. vocabulary, visuals, supplemental writing resources, etc.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The instructional reports released to schools in June provide valuable information in terms of how each class in Grades 3, 4,  and 5 performed (in comparison to NYC averages as well as the previous year's percentages) on each question and standard on  the NYC ELA and MATH Exams. This information is shared with teachers to inform their planning of targeted instruction for all  students.   In addition, as previously mentioned, we have set up Google documents for each grade, into which teachers enter all  assessment data throughout the year. Performance levels can be calculated based on this data, which helps teachers form  small groups, set targeted goals, and plan specific strategies and skills to teach towards progress.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Instruction is delivered via dually certified classroom teachers (Common Branches and either ENL or bilingual Chinese)  wherever possible to provide continuity of instruction within the classroom and to minimize disruption to the  classroom by pull-out teachers.  In addition, push-in ENL teachers provide additional support to students who need  more individualized and/or small group instruction.   In classrooms where there is an ENL-licensed teacher, the grouping of students is heterogeneous (mixed proficiency  levels). Students at the commanding level are placed in monolingual classes and provided with integrated ENL  supports in ELA/content areas - these students are either pulled out by ENL support teachers and grouped with similar  students from other classes, or an ENL-licensed teacher will push-in to the classroom and provide such students with  additional support.      Stand-alone ENL is instruction to develop English language skills so that students can succeed in core content courses.  It is delivered by a certified ENL teacher. A student may not receive stand-alone ENL in lieu of core content area  instruction.   Integrated ENL is instruction to build English language skills through content area instruction. It is delivered by a dually  certified teacher (ENL and a content area). All ELLs and former ELLs up to 2 years after exiting ELL status must receive  a minimum number of units of integrated ENL.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     The only children in a transitional Chinese bilingual program are our self-contained special needs children.  We are  currently the District 2 barrier-free site for one self-contained Chinese bilingual special classes -  a bridge grades K-2   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         (12:1:1). This class is staffed with a teacher who is dually certified in special education and bilingual/ENL education.  The content areas of math and science are taught using HLA, and great emphasis is placed on literacy through ELA and  all content areas.   TBE programs are designed so that students develop conceptual skills in their home language as they learn English. All  instruction is Common Core-aligned to accelerate student achievement. As students (all ELLs) develop English  language skills, time in the home language decreases. When ELLs reach proficiency on the NYSESLAT, they are placed  in a monolingual class in English with home language supports.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   For our ENL program, we are doing the following:  Children who are placed with classroom teachers with dual certification in ENL and Common Branches receive more than their  mandated number of instructional minutes in ENL (360 minutes for students at the Entering and Emerging levels) and 180  minutes for Transitional and Expanding students.  Teachers use ENL methodology and appropriate balanced literacy strategies  whenever they work with the children so they are getting ENL support throughout the day.   For children who cannot be placed into self-contained classrooms (due to class size and registers), they are placed with  teachers who have a great deal of experience working with second language learners.  We look at the proficiency levels of  each child, group them accordingly and have scheduled certified ENL staff to work with children for their mandated number of  instructional minutes each day as push-in ENL teachers -  if space and conditions allow. Entering and emerging-level students  meet with ENL teachers for at least 360 minutes per week (usually a double period per day) while transitioning and expanding- level students meet with ENL teachers for at least 180 minutes per week (or one period per day).   ENL teachers are assigned  to work with specific grades and classes to allow them to plan with the classroom teachers more effectively.   Children have access to native language materials through the school library and Internet sources as needed.      Students in the transitional bilingual program are serviced by their own classroom teachers, who are dually certified in  bilingual education and special education. Native language is used to help with understanding and comprehension, particularly  in the content areas of math and science. Vocabulary, visuals, models, oral explanations are all strategies used to help students  make meaning of texts and the world and culture around them.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Content area instruction is delivered to students in English, using ENL methodology, and is infused into our literacy block, as  we do with the other populations (special needs, general education, and G&T).  Students learn content and vocabulary in  context as they are engaged in shared reading lessons.  Visual aids (video clips, SMART boards, pictures, Internet resources,  etc.) are used to help children understand the materials.  In addition, children learn to do research (in books, via computer  programs and the Internet), work in groups, make oral presentations and role-play to enrich and improve their language  development. Our balanced literacy approach supports teachers in making content comprehensible via many different ways in  order to foster language development among our ELLs. Lessons in our Math in Focus curriculum put emphasis on vocabulary  and effective strategies to help with problem solving. Science and social studies content are mostly embedded in the  curriculum goals. Native language support will enhance this and other content area learning.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   All of our ELLs (with the exception of the children in the special education special classes) are in an ENL-only program; as a  result, they will not be evaluated in their native language.  For the special education students, the bilingual special education  teacher provides them with teacher-made assessments that are appropriate to the abilities and needs of the special needs  students they serve. In the past, when we have had students in grade 3 in our Transitional Bilingual Education program - the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      students had to take the Chinese reading test this year, which gave us some insight into their understanding of their native  language in literacy-based tasks.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.  Children who are SIFE are given additional support through one-to one intervention during the day and support through our  extended school day program.  Their progress is monitored and we have on-going contact with the home through our bilingual  school staff.     b.  We have dually certified teachers on most grades (either ENL/Common Branches or Bilingual Chinese/Common Branches)  as well as Chinese bilingual educational assistants assigned where the majority of our new arrivals are (lower grades). Children  receive most of their ENL instruction within their own classrooms, thereby increasing continuity of instruction.  Teachers use  ENL strategies in the content areas to help children learn.  Bilingual staff are available to support the children as needed and to  increase parent involvement by providing translations for parents at school meetings, events and classroom celebrations.  In  addition, these children are given ample support in language development and test-taking strategies through our extended  school day program.     c.  Most of our developing students are also students who have exhibited some other difficulties in learning.  Additional  targeted instruction with ENL specialists is given, either through individual or small group service, as well as at-risk services  with intervention specialists, depending on the need.  Progress is monitored and discussed at the AIS and PPT  meetings.  Parents are kept apprised of their children’s progress as well, in some cases, after exhausting all school resources,  there may be a need to have an evaluation made to see if there are other issues.     d.  We are a K-5 school and do not have ELL students longer than 6 years.     e. We have many teachers who are experienced in working with ELLs and have attended professional development specifically  targeted for teachers of ELLs in the mainstream classroom. Many of these teachers have also previously served as ENL  teachers, using formerly recognized city ancillary ENL licenses or who are finishing up coursework towards their ENL  certification.  They are all cognizant of the needs of ELLs and work closely with our current ENL staff and ENL supervisor to  provide support to our former ELLs.  All former ELLs are given the necessary testing accommodations (extended time, separate  location) up to two years after reaching proficiency. Those who need additional support are included in  after school extended  school day programs for intervention.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Some instructional strategies would include the usage of the following:    -  Word Study Strategies  such as Wilson Fundations – to tackle phonetics, how to build words and to recognize the patterns  in various sounds/digraphs/blends;  teaching of root words – understanding root words can help students scaffold their  knowledge – e.g. civis = civil, civilization, citizen, civilized, etc.; teaching of prefixes and suffixes – understanding these can  serve as a context clue for students in finding out the meaning of what they’re reading; sight words/high frequency words  word center – to help students memorize and build on words that they would see often and would need to use often.    -  Context clue strategies can help a student in figuring out unknown words such as  reading the sentence before and/or after  to provide more meaning ; synonym key words (and, like, such as, also); antonym key words  (unlike, however, but, although,  even though), etc.    -  Teaching of nonfiction text features helps students understand what each element is and how they can aid students in  thinking deeper and finding more information about a topic (such as captions/labels, subheadings/subtitles, glossary, table of  content, index; special words – bold, underlined, italicized, etc.).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52        -  Teaching various balanced literacy strategies such as character mapping, story sketching, and cooperative group discussions  to scaffold ELLs/SWDs’ learning.  Some grade level materials would include the usage of technology:    -  Raz-kids: provides leveled texts for students, allows them to move according to their reading level    -  Brainpop.com or brainpopjr.com – both sites come with videos that would provide extra scaffolding in video form,  brainpopjr would be geared towards the younger population/ELLs/SWDs    -  Discoveryeducation.com – also a site that provides teacher-led videos that would help the students in gaining supplemental  information about topics     Some grade level materials would include:    -  Usage of guided reading books that would target a student’s needs in building knowledge as well as the development of the  various strategies mentioned above (appropriately leveled, high-interest topics)    -  Usage of nonfiction texts and fiction texts that are paired on the same topic – this would help students understand where  writers/authors receive their ideas from, also helps students make a connection of real life and the text.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Curriculum flexibility allows both classroom teachers and ELL/SETSS instructors to provide students with frequent exposure to  the same topic, even if the students are pulled out from their regular classes.  This would allow ENL/SETSS teachers to support  the students in areas where they are having issues with as well as provide students with more information on the same topic  that the general education teachers are working on. Differentiated texts/experiences/graphic organizers can be provided  through this flexibility. As a school, we ensure that flexible programming is used to maximize time spent with non-disabled  peers through a heterogeneous mix of students in each class.      Instructional flexibility allows the ENL/SETSS teachers to analyze what the students’ weaknesses are and to provide targeted  instruction so as to build on this particular area and to help a student understand what he/she needs to do.  In addition, this  would provide general education teachers as well as ENL/SWD teachers better insight on how to serve the students in a more  efficient/effective manner.  Also, if the teachers feel that ELLs/SWDs require more instruction on a particular topic, the  ENL/SETSS teachers can provide more opportunities in targeted practice.     Scheduling flexibility allows the teachers (both general education and ENL/SETSS) to target a student’s needs. Through the  usage of open communication and collaboration, teachers would work together during push-in sessions so that they can  provide leveled texts and differentiation while teaching the same topic in small groups. Pull-out sessions would also allow for  targeted instruction as well as minimizing any sort of distractions that might impede a SWD from understanding what needs to  be done.  In addition, this provides the students with the opportunity to ask questions on anything they are confused about  within class.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  In analyzing our ELL data in ELA, math, and science, we found that our ELL students were relatively strong in their content  knowledge while understandably much weaker in ELA. Also, an analysis of our NYSESLAT data reveals that our students are  weaker in the modalities of reading and writing.  Our targeted intervention for all of the ELL subgroups, as a result, focuses on  English language development skills, with an emphasis on reading and writing. The materials used will be both fiction and non- fiction, so as to address some of the content weaknesses as well during their intervention programs, including test prep.  While  Social Studies data is no longer available (the State no longer gives the Social Studies exam), we do not have data other than  classroom assessments to determine weaknesses and strengths in Social Studies.  We address social studies needs within our  non-fiction intervention, since Social studies content is imbedded into our teacher-created literacy units. Native language  support in the content areas will enhance understanding.     For students in Grades 1 and 2, the newly-established Title III after school program (1½ hours, once a week, in January through   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      May; students are in groups of no more than 10 students with an ENL-certified teacher) will continue to provide our younger  ELLs with supplemental experiences to support growth in listening, speaking, reading and writing through games and other  hands-on activities.  For our 3rd, 4th and 5th grade ELL students, the intervention services are provided in English, using ENL strategies, through  Title III funds in an extended school day program that will meet 1½ hours, once a week (Thursdays) from mid-November  through the end of March, just before the testing period begins.  The classes are organized in homogeneous proficiency groups  of no more than 12-15 students each.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      A school-wide goal is to show more evidence of rigor and data-driven differentiation in instruction, with a whole-school  concentration on writing. We will have at least one teacher on each grade who will be attending writing professional  development through Teachers' College. Grade teams will utilize newly-purchased TC writing units to enhance our existing  literacy units. We are also looking to continue our practice of all teachers engaging in at least 2 cycles of learning during our  Monday PD times to enhance their own professional learning around topics of interest. In addition, to further the work begun  in collaboration with an external math consultant to improve pedagogical practices in math and challenge students' thinking  through rigorous problem solving, teachers will continue to align current math curriculum with Common Core standards and  incorporate rich tasks and more engaging, hands-on activities.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We do not plan to discontinue any program or service.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs have equal access to all school programs. Our school has a very strong emphasis on the arts as a venue to motivate  children to come to school and to provide a means for children to learn and practice language and social skills.  Every child in  every grade from Pre-K through Grade 5, regardless of learning ability (special needs, ELL, general education or Gifted &  Talented), has the privilege of participating in an arts residency program (visual/fine arts, dance, theater, and music) that is  linked to improving academic performance skills and content knowledge (reading, writing, speaking, listening, math, social  studies, and science).  These programs are part of the children’s school day.  We have ELLs in our Gifted and Talented Program who are receiving support and doing well in the program.  Our school-sponsored after arts school programs include chorus, instrumental music, ballroom dance club, photo club,  yearbook club, and lion dance club and are held on days alternate to our academic intervention programs (Wednesdays and  Fridays) to allow children who have to attend the academic extended school day to participate in the extra-curricular  activities.  These programs have contributed to the success of our school and have increased parent involvement  tremendously.     In addition, ELLs in the 3rd, 4th and 5th grade are provided with an opportunity to attend an extended school day program to  improve their English language skills in reading, writing, speaking and listening.  This supplemental program is offered on  Wednesdays/Thursdays for 1.5 hours. The Title III ENL supplemental, after school program is open to all ELLs in Grades 1 and 2  for 1.5 hours a week (January through May).      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Content area instruction is in English, using appropriate ENL methodology. Native language can be used to help with better  understanding of content area  material. We use many high-interest, low vocabulary books (as well as picture books) for  language development and to teach social studies and science.  Students have access to listening centers as instructional tools  in the classroom.  SMART/Promethean boards, computers, Internet access, and document cameras are in all classrooms to  allow for visual/interactive and independent learning which engage and motivate second language learners to access content  in various ways and practice what they have learned.   In addition to a 36-station computer lab that is accessible to ELL  students, there are mobile laptop carts that classroom teachers and ENL specialists can use with their students.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      We have many teachers and support staff who speak and/or read Chinese and who provide native language support as  necessary (e.g., explaining directions in the native language to students who need it so that they can understand what to do in  class, providing notes to parents in Chinese to explain homework assignments for home support, etc.).  The bilingual special  needs classroom delivers language support as per the children’s IEPs.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Students are grouped by both grade level and age (as appropriate) with some consideration given to last grade  completed.  Teachers use ENL strategies and materials and resources  that are high interest/low vocabulary but grade/age  appropriate to teach content instruction.  Because we have many teachers who are dually certified ESL/Common Branches,  ELLs in those classes receive ENL support all day long in their own classrooms. Flexible scheduling allows for out-of-classroom  personnel to push-in or pull-out of classroms to provide extra support.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We are not a co-located school and do not share our building with any other school.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   We have tri-lingual staff in the main office (English, Chinese, and Spanish) who are able to explain to parents their program  choices for the children at the time of registration.    •     We also have parent orientations at the beginning of the school year and individual meetings with new admits as they  come in to register throughout the year.    •     Parents are given the brochure with the program choice information and are given an opportunity to view the orientation  video in the language of the parents.   •     They also have the opportunity to meet with the Principal and/or ENL coordinator to answer any questions and an  opportunity to visit the classrooms.  •     A parents’ school handbook is given to every parent.  The handbook outlines school policies, procedures, programs and  contact numbers of key people in the school (principal, assistant principals, guidance counselors, programs, parent  coordinator, Parents Association, IEP team, nurse, etc.) for parents’ reference. The handbook is provided in both English and  Chinese.  - New incoming students engage in self-awareness activities, e.g. "getting to know You" projects when they first arrive in their  classrooms. The various arts programs offered here allow them to express themselves creatively. Collaborative group work  within classrooms supports new students with peer modeling of language.     The school provides staff with the necessary materials and information to share with families of ELLs and which will enable  them to help ELLs transition from elementary school to middle school.  In addition, materials and letters are translated into the  children’s home language with the information they need.  Bilingual staff members are available to assist teachers when they  meet with parents on a one-to-one basis during school hours and/or to assist in translation on the telephone as needed. Our  guidance counselor is active in the middle school admissions process and familiar with the SEMS system and is available to  assist teachers and parents with making informed decisions about their children's future schooling experiences.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55   N/A           Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Even though our numbers indicate that we have only about 16% who are current ELLs, we have many students who may have  passed the required assessments but still need English language support.  Because of this, all of our professional development  has been specifically designed to include considerations for second language learners for all personnel - common branch  teachers, ENL teachers, bilingual teachers, guidance counselors, secretaries, parent coordinators.  We have been engaged in  school-wide child study inquiry work, focused on how to differentiate instruction for students with different learning styles and  taking into account their language development, whether they are struggling students or our "high-fliers."  We will use our Monday professional development time, Tuesday parent engagement and professional responsibilities time, as  well as weekly grade-level meetings for teachers to work together to learn more about ENL-related methodologies and  resources.      Mondays are designated as professional development days for professional learning for staff.  Links to professional  development opportunities are also provided to staff via our weekly staff newsletter, email, and postings.     Workshops and visits to successful ENL classrooms are arranged for the ENL and Bilingual staff as requested or necessary.  We  keep ourselves informed of opportunities and trainings offered through the Department of English Language Learners and  Student Support (DELLSS). We had several ENL teachers participate in our District's ENL Leads meetings as well as the  Kellogg/Asian American Federation grant-related workshops and intervisitations at the various participating schools. These  teachers then turnkey the information they learned from these opportunities to their fellow staff members. To the extent  possible, we look at making arrangements for ENL teachers and providers and Bilingual staff to attend citywide or State- sponsored workshops and/or conferences on Bilingual Education and ENL and look at differentiated instruction as it relates to  ELLs.  Workshops offered by the DELLSS are attended by our ENL providers and some classroom teachers, depending on  availability during the school year.  All of these PD opportunities will ensure that teachers deliver high-quality, Common-core aligned instruction to their students.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Monday PD sessions, as well as Tuesday's professional responsibility time, are utilized to provide staff with learning  opportunities to support the various types of learners in their classrooms. Learning cycles allow for teachers across grades and  subjects to collaborate in determining and trying out new strategies, as well as in sharing of best practices already occurring in  classrooms.     ENL-specific meetings are also held throughout the year to discuss specific topics, such as NYSESLAT, vocabulary & visual  supports. use of data, technology, and assessments to drive instructional decisions, etc.     In addition, one common prep grade meeting each month (45 minutes/period) is devoted to looking at the student work of  ELLs and former ELLs and discussing and sharing best practices.  Meetings are documented by minutes and/or Google  Documents.   Teachers are able to share with each other successful strategies that are being implemented with ELLs in their  classrooms at these sessions and a plan of action for next steps are recorded.  Teachers are expected to try out these  suggested next steps and report back as to the results at the next session.  In addition, new teacher support meetings are held  to help teachers understand how to work with ELLs in their classrooms.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         The total number of hours in these sessions exceed the minimum ELL training hours required for both general education and  special education staff. Agendas, attendance and minutes are recorded at each meeting and are uploaded into electronic  folders (organized by grade and by content/subject/topic) located on the sidebar of our weekly e-newsletter that is sent to the  entire staff by our Principal. These documents and folders are accessible to everyone on our staff.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   ENL support teachers maintain consistent contact with families to keep them updated of their children's progress in regards to  language development. They meet with families during additional conferences and meetings, especially during the designated  Tuesday parent engagement time block. Report cards and additional progress reports go home quarterly to delineate students'  growth and areas for improvement in all content areas, including  grades for speaking, listening and language, academic and  personal behaviors, and social-emotional development.  Records are kept for individual meetings with ELL parents, as well as outreach to ensure parent needs are accommodated by  entering them into iLog (Intervention Log) through the NYCDOE ATS system. Logs/attendance/minutes are kept for all  meetings, phone calls, and written correspondence.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parent involvement at our school has been excellent.  Almost 99% of our parents, including parents of ELLs, attend both the  fall and spring Parent Teacher conferences.  Parent Association meetings are generally very well attended by parents of ELLs  and former ELLs. This can be attributed to the fact that we include a parenting segment (i.e., how to be more involved in their  child's education,  what kinds of questions to ask at Parent Teacher conferences, how to prepare their children for middle  school admission, how to access their children's information on the NYC Schools account/STARS, etc.) at each of the  meetings.  Translation services are always available. The Parent Coordinator is present for virtually all meetings and makes  herself available to address parents one-on-one regarding specific needs.  Parents of ELLs are also very involved with class  celebrations, trips and school events where they can see how well the children are learning.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    In addition to the rigorous academic program that we offer, we have an extensive performing arts program in dance, music and  theater for all of our students.  These programs are especially helpful in developing the English language proficiency and the  academic performance of our ELL students.  They allow ELLs to learn through hands-on experiences and to demonstrate what they  have learned through performances and celebrations.  As a result, many of our ELLs have scored exceptionally well in their content  areas as well as on the standardized exams.                          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Renny Fong, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 130 Hernando De Soto                                                                              School DBN: 02M130  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Our main office is comprised of staff who are bilingual; they are fluent in English/Chinese  (Cantonese/Mandarin/Toysanese) or English/Spanish. When parents come in to register, they fill out home  language surveys, forms that indicate language of preference for written communications, and are interviewed by  the staff to see what dialect they understand. We also look at the information we can gather from other sources,  e.g. ATS Report of Preferred Languages, blue emergency card data, parent surveys, and teacher surveys.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.
