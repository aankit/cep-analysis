This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      By offering public high school-age students a tuition-free college course of study in the liberal arts and sciences, Bard  Early College Queens seeks to raise the quality and standards of secondary education and enable students from all  backgrounds to succeed in college at our campus and beyond. We act on this mission through four core principles:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9         Inspire and prepare high school-age students to become leaders across fields through a rigorous course of  study that emphasizes critical thinking, writing, inquiry, and discourse.  Increase college access, affordability, and completion for adolescents by allowing them to earn up to two  years of tuition-free, transferable Bard College credits and an Associates degree.     Bridge the gap between high school and college by bringing the key characteristics to liberal arts college      classrooms to public school settings.  Increase levels of equity for accessing quality education by prioritizing admission for top applicants who are  also coming from families who are historically under-represented in higher education.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The Bard Community       Bard High School Early College Queens (BHSECQ), as its name suggests, is both a high school and an early college,  awarding its graduates both a New York State Regents diploma and an Associate of Arts degree from Bard College.  BHSECQ students complete the traditional high school curriculum in ninth and tenth grades, and then take two years  of college-level courses in the same building.   By offering public high school-age students a tuition-free college course of study in the liberal arts and sciences,  BHSECQ seeks to raise the quality and standards of public secondary education and enable students from all  backgrounds to succeed in college, at BHSECQ and beyond.   Bard College, founded in 1860 in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. Bard College has an extensive involvement with  early colleges. Bard College at Simon’s Rock, which awards both two-year and four-year degrees to young scholars,  opened its doors in 1964. BHSEC Manhattan opened in 2001. BHSECQ opened in 2008. BHSEC Newark opened in  2011. BHSEC as part of Harlem Children Zone opened in 2013. BHSEC Cleveland in 2014, and BHSEC Baltimore opened  in the fall of 2015.   More than 70% of our full-time faculty hold doctorate degrees. Most are experienced college professors with a special  interest in working with younger students. We offer a rigorous curriculum that includes college mathematics and  science classes and an array of seminars in the humanities and social sciences. Writing and critical analysis skills are  fundamental to students’ success at BHSECQ. Our Writing & Thinking Workshops, a week-long orientation for all  students at the start of each academic year, offer students a chance to learn by speaking aloud in small groups after  reading original source material and writing responses to the texts. This form of active, engaged reading aims to  develop students’ awareness of the many kinds of language and the relation of language to thinking.      Educational Oasis    BHSECQ is located in Long Island City on the top floors of an eight-story former warehouse, built in 1914 and  renovated to become part of the Queens Atrium Corporate Center. Besides BHSECQ, current tenants are two other  public high schools (the High School of Applied Communication and the Academy of Finance and Enterprise), and  LaGuardia Community College. Past tenants include the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts, which relocated to a new  building in nearby Astoria in 2009.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      It is a rapidly-changing neighborhood. Numerous commercial and residential skyscrapers are under construction on  nearby streets, and several other warehouses are undergoing conversions into luxury apartments. With several other  high schools and colleges also now in the area, foot traffic to and from the nearby subway stations is very heavy  during school hours. Across Thomson Avenue is Sunnyside Yard, which is used by Amtrak and NJ Transit trains, and  through which runs the Long Island Rail Road’s Main Line.       Because of our proximity to the Long Island Expressway, Queens Boulevard, Northern Boulevard, and the Queensboro  Bridge, motor vehicle traffic is very heavy on the roads. Concerned about traffic safety community, in 2013 the  schools in our building hired a traffic engineering firm to collect pedestrian and vehicular traffic data, review accident  reports, and recommend safety measures. As a result of this effort, which included the active participation of BHSECQ  faculty and students, traffic patterns on Thomson Avenue were modified to restrict turns, countdown clocks were  added to pedestrian crossings, and a pedestrian plaza was created where students stand while waiting to cross.      BHSECQ draws students from all five boroughs of New York City, which is both a strength and a challenge. It’s a  strength because it brings with it a diversity of ethnicity's, religions, family incomes, and ties to many of the  contrasting neighborhoods of the city. But drawing students from such a wide geographical area is also a challenge  because it makes it harder for the community to come together within the school. We try our best to meet this  challenge with numerous sports teams, student clubs, and after-school activities, as well as through frequent morning  and evening meetings for parents, and through efforts to reach out online through an actively-managed website, an  activities calendar, Facebook groups, and other social media. Despite the challenges of traveling beyond their  neighborhoods, each year more than 3,000 students apply to BHSECQ eager to partake in the school’s rich intellectual  experience.          Diversity Recruitment Programs       We recruit students from all social, economic, and ethnic groups. The Borough of Queens is one of the most diverse  urban areas in the world. In a 2014 study by Randy Olson of U.S. Racial Diversity by County, Queens County was third  (behind two census tracts in the Aleutian Islands). Nearly half of the population in Queens is foreign-born. No racial or  ethnic group holds a majority in our county. Residents speak at least 138 languages at home. According to the latest  U.S. Census figures, the borough’s makeup is roughly 25% white, 27% Hispanic, 24% Asian, 20% African-American, and  4% other.      BHSECQ mirrors its diverse community: we are one of the most diverse high schools in the entire city. No racial or  ethnic group comprises more than 35% of our students, and none comprises less than 10% of our students. There are  very few other schools in the city where both these statements are true.      Funded by a New York State grant, our Smart Transfer program helps us support economic diversity in our  community. We want to ensure that we provide access to BHSECQ and appropriate academic support for students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      who come to our school from schools recognized by the state as serving a high percentage of economically  disadvantaged families.      We have actively recruited students from schools in neighborhoods identified by the Annenberg Institute for School  Reforms study, “Is Demography Still Destiny,” as those where residents are least likely to graduate ready for college.  We are reaching out to these schools to make students and parents aware of the opportunities offered by BHSECQ as  they decide which New York City public high school they want to attend. These students form a significant proportion  of our Smart Transfer Fellows.   Once admitted, our Smart Transfer Fellows get ample support to help them perform as well as their peers who  graduated from middle schools that were not under funded or located in poorer neighborhoods. Our goal is that the  percentage of Smart Tranfer fellows who earn a grade point average of 2.0 or greater will match that for students  who graduated from middle schools with more resources. Before entering BHSECQ, all Smart Transfer Fellows are  invited to participate in a three-week summer preparation program with courses in the humanities, math, study skills,  and art. During the school year they have access to the Learning Commons, where students can meet with faculty or  peer tutors for additional academic support. All Smart Transfer Fellows are also given a Chromobook so that they  have access to similar technology as their wealthier peers.      Because of good bus, and subway connections, we draw students from all five boroughs. We compete with not only  the many zoned high schools that serve specific neighborhoods, but also the selective and specialized high schools  that recruit students from across the city. One of the ways we do that is by preparing students not only to enter  college and do well, but to finish college with a degree. This year is the first year our Smart Transfer Fellows will be  offered and opportunity to take a college course in the summer prior to entering our third year when they will take all  college courses. This summer course is intended to provide a smooth transition from 10th grade to the first year of  college.    Transferring to a Four-Year College    Of the 153 students in the class of 2018, 148 (97%) earned at least 60 college credits while at BHSECQ and completed  the requirements for an Associate of Arts degree from Bard College. All graduates have the opportunity to apply  credits at their next college, with differing options for credit transfer, depending upon the receiving school’s policies.   All BHSECQ college credits are fully accepted at CUNY schools and SUNY campuses, as well as at a few private  colleges; many of our graduates enter college as juniors and finish a bachelor’s degree program in just two years, or  use their full four years to pursue dual majors. Even at colleges that accept few or no transfer credits at all, our  graduates use their BHSECQ college credits to place out of the introductory courses typically required of freshmen  and move on immediately to more advanced courses. Our college degree program is accredited by the New England  Association of Schools and Colleges.   More importantly than just getting into college, our students finish college at a higher rate than graduates of other  high schools. Metis Associates, a national research and consulting firm, delivered the results of a study that followed  the 2010 graduates of the two New York City Bard High School Early Colleges through their next colleges. It compared  their four-year graduation rates to those of of students who had similar academic and demographic profiles when  they entered other New York City high schools, including the specialized or selective high schools. The differences  were dramatic.   Among males, for example, 69% of the Bard students graduated from a four-year college within four years compared  to 36% of the specialized high school alumni and 29% of the general high school alumni. Among African-Americans,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      71% of the Bard students graduated from a four-year college compared to 54% of the specialized high schools and  34% of the general high schools.   In addition, the Metis Associates study also noted the percentage of Bard Early College students who graduated from  college in either two or three years. Among the Bard graduates, 34.1% did so. Among the alumni of traditional high  schools, 7.0% did so. Among the graduates of the specialized or selective high schools, only 5.6% did so. With the cost  of college tuition as high as it is, the savings for those who graduate early can be enormous.   BHSECQ graduates thrive in college because we stress college-readiness in all our courses. We prepare students not  only to apply and be accepted to some of the nation’s top colleges and universities, but also to finish their course of  study in four years or fewer. BHSECQ graduates develop the skills needed for college success while earning their A.A.  degree in the New York City public school system.         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We know have students who are in the first three years at BHSEC who can benefit from an integrated co-teaching  model. Like in our general education model, the students each are unique and have individual needs that are spelled  out on their Individual education plans. What they have in common is that they learn better with some additional  assistance in the classroom. Over the past three years we have hired five teacher to meet the needs of this growing  special education population.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   We have always taken pride in the rigorous instruction we provide students. This year under the Rigorous Instruction  Element of the framework, we grew in a number of ways. Our departmental teams worked together during  professional development opportunities to compile a series of best practices used to ensure equity of voice in our  classrooms. Additionally ten of our faculty and administrators attended professional development on Restorative  Practices. This has shifted some thinking in a positive way to bring better understanding of both the history and the  current climate and how ensuring all voices are heard provides a richer learning environment for all students.    Additionally we held a Guest Speaker Series on Wednesday Afternoons open to the entire campus. Speakers were  expertise in their field and brought that expertise to our community.    This year we modified our admission practices so that the student body is more reflective of the NYC public school  population in terms of socio-economic status. Economic status in no way determines interest or ability to succeed  academically and we would like to ensure that our admission criteria continue to move towards a more  representative number of students from across the family income levels.    Further diversification across our program includes the students with special education learning needs. All students  who are interested in starting college early and have the ability and motivation should have equal access to our  program. We are committed to training faculty and hiring additional teachers with special education teaching licenses  to provide that opportunity to our students who require additional learning supports.                     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 24Q299   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   623   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

The Bard High School Early College schools are founded on the belief that teachers qualified to be college faculty,  those with doctorate degrees or significant graduate education, professional qualifications, and accomplishments in  their field can best ensure that students who complete our program are truly ready for college. At BHSECQ, 99% of  our students who graduated in 2018 were college ready (compared to the city-wide average of 32%) and 97% of them  enrolled in a college or post-secondary program within six months after graduating.   In our hiring practices at Bard High School Early College schools we ensure that our college faculty, who have deep  knowledge of their field and an understanding of college expectations, are genuinely interested and committed to  working with younger students. They must develop skills and flexibility in meeting students where they are and  fostering their learning with effective scaffolding techniques. They are committed to working with a diverse student  population with a range of economic, racial, ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds. This school year we continue  to expand the continuum of services that we offer to students with 504 accommodations and Individualized  Education Plans.   BHSECQ faculty members learn to accurately assess what students can accomplish at various stages in their  development by working collaboratively with their colleagues and through professional development. They discover  effective means of motivating and encouraging younger students who come to us with preparation from a range of  middle schools and educational experiences to develop the skills to succeed in our program and beyond.      Strengths:     Our Quality Review scores have consistently been graded as “exceeding target” and our overall score in our   most recent Quality review was “well-developed.”     To maintain the diverse culture that makes learning at BHSECQ a deeply rich experience, we want a student   population that is representative of the diversity of the borough in which we are located. As we become  better known and as demand for our early college model increases, we have redoubled our recruiting efforts  for prospective students who do not know about BHSECQ and otherwise might not find out. For our incoming  ninth grade class in 2018, we joined the DOE initiative to offer 63% of our seats to students with free and  reduced lunch.   o   In 2018, 33% of BHSECQ students were specifically recruited from Schools with a student population  that where85% or more were eligible for free lunch . We are making an effort to visit middle schools  and community organizations in neighborhoods identified by the Annenberg Institute for School   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15   Reform as having a low college-readiness rating so that their students are aware of the opportunities  offered by BHSECQ. We continued that effort in 2018-19.   o  For students with Individualized Education Plans we offer the Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) model of  classes in the ninth and tenth grades, and Year 1, and related services to support students in and out  of classes. To this end, we hired a total of five full-time Special Education teachers over the past three  years..         Needs:      As our school becomes more diverse, and in keeping with feedback we have received from current students,   this year we are emphasizing increased equity of voice in our classrooms.

Theme: Finding Voice and  Exploring Identity. Survey students and faculty about this  year's workshop and get input from all stakeholders for  developing next year's workshop. This will provide diverse  content and model the kind of inclusion we want  represented throughout the curriculum.   Shift 9th grade math assessment for determining who can  enter 10th grade math as ninth grade students. This  historically relied on parent advocacy. Move to a system of  all students providing a math autobiography and information  about ability in algebra and geometry and inviting all  students with strong skills to take a placement test to  identify the few students with strong math skills who can  skip our 9th grade math offering.              3b – Parent and Family Engagement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          17      How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York  State standards in order to support their children at home?

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?     Strengths   ·ADVISORY – All BHSECQ students meet with a faculty advisor each Wednesday for one period. We have worked to  make advisory more meaningful for faculty and students by having advisors stay with their groups for four years  and then pairing them with an additional college advisor as students are applying to transfer to their next college.  We also have created an advisory committee made up of faculty, staff, and students, which meets once a week to  develop enhancements to the advisory program. One such recently adopted enhancement is having our soon-to-  graduate students meet with younger students during their advisory meetings, giving them an opportunity to  confer about BHSECQ’s college program and the process of transferring from it into a four-year program at another  college.   · COMMUNICATION - We have a student activities website, we have school messenger, and have recently added  some components of io classroom for communication with families. We use the Naviance college-advising tool,  which makes it easy to communicate with large groups of students and/or parents, and to share information with  the college advisors. We also have Google email accounts for all students and teachers to enhance where addresses  self-populate for ease in communication. Jupiter grades and Google classroom also allow ease in communication  with the entire class.   · RETENTION – This is an area where we have steadily improved, and are now transferring fewer students out. We  have especially improved with our Smart Scholars (students coming from underserved middle schools), and  students with disabilities. Summer Bridge is a program that we use to help orient students to the school and the  environment when they arrive. Students also benefit from our Diversity Initiative, our Learning Commons and  faculty office hours, our increased math recitation sections, and our peer mentoring and mentoring programs. We  also hired an additional Guidance Counselor, dedicated to the ninth grade and serving half time as a Student  Activities Coordinator, whose focus is helping students connect to the community in positive ways from the start of  ninth grade.   · RESPECT FOR ALL – As a school we celebrate every student and their unique points of view and backgrounds. We  established a gender-neutral bathroom, held trainings for faculty and students on LGBTQ issues and race and  ethnicity, and encouraged students to form identity-based groups to help them feel connected to their  community—e.g., Muslim Students Association, Black Student Union, Undocufriendly, La Fueraa Unida, Sexuality  and Gender Alliance, The Jew(ish) club, Young Women’s Leadership Club, Girls Who Code, Asian Culture Club,  Feminista Journal, Seekers Club., Action Response Club. We have an active student government, with  representatives from each advisory. We want everyone in our community to know that all voices are valued.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19      · COLLEGE READINESS – BHSECQ faculty actively support college readiness by guiding essential skill-building as  described in a study prepared for the Gates Foundation, Overall, more than 95% of BHSEC graduates have gone on  to matriculate in a four-year degree program. The flexibility of the Bard College A.A. degree—which is based in the  study in the liberal arts and sciences— is shown in the range of schools and baccalaureate degree programs  graduates continue onto. BHSEC offers a robust math and science program that includes field-experienced, highly  trained scientists and mathematicians who teach both the high school and college math and science classes. 48% of  BHSEC graduates tracked through the National Student Clearinghouse earned a bachelor’s degree in STEM fields.  Bard High School Early College Queens has a proven history of fostering a college-going culture among all students.  From the three-week summer scholars program for incoming 9th grade students to the three- or four-day college  campus tour of public and private schools for our students in their third year, BHSEC students have a variety of  opportunities to help acclimate themselves to the college experience. Additionally, administration at Bard College  and BHSEC continually collaborate to create opportunities for BHSEC students to visit the Annandale campus  throughout their four years, including attending events such as the Hannah Arendt Conference (an extended  academic conference in Political Theory that draws prominent academic and public figures globally), the  Experimental Humanities Conference (a site of collaboration for students and faculty from across the Bard College  network, in the U.S. and abroad), and the Bard Center for Civic Engagement Get Engaged Conference (which brings  together student leaders from across the Bard College network to share projects and initiatives that connect the  classroom with social justice activities in the communities that Bard serves), as well as various opportunities to  participate in science research and college debate tournaments.       According to the 2016-17 Quality Snapshot for BHSECQ, 99% of our students graduated college ready (compared to  the New York City average of 47%). We believe it is essential that we prepare all our students to gain admission to,  succeed while attending, and graduate from four-year colleges and universities.      Priority Needs:   We would like to establish a school environment where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their  teachers and peers no matter what their background. When we opened the school in 2008 and through 2010 we  were a Title 1 school with greater than 50% of our students eligible for free or reduced lunch. That number has  continued to decrease with time. Currently 34% of our students are eligible for free or reduced lunch in a city  where nearly 70% of the high school are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Additionally within our school  community we will enhance social/emotional training workshops to provide both access and equity for students  who are historically underrepresented in higher education which includes low-income students, Black students,  LatinX students, first generation students, and students with disabilities.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  Our annual goal is to increase equity and access to a Bard High School Early College Queens education such that  63% of our offers to rising 9th grade students will go to students whose families are directly certified for free- or  reduced-price lunch. Additionally we will support at least 90 similar students enrolled in our 9th and 10th grade  from backgrounds that are historically underrepresented in higher education with a newly developed  social/emotional programs that meets monthly.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          20     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies your  school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this Framework  for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to impact  change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with disabilities,  English language learners, and other high-need student  subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE, STH).   We will work with New York City's Central Enrollment Office to  participate in the diversity pilot program so that 61% of the offers for  seats in our ninth grade will go to students from families that are directly  certified for a free- or reduced-price lunch.   Train 50 current students as student ambassadors in public speaking so  that they can represent the school at the fairs, our open houses, and can  lead our tours.    Run five open house events between September and mid-November,  attend all HS fairs, run student-led tours once a week. Specifically attend  the fairs for special education.

The study notes that low-income middle  school students often choose more advantaged and less segregated  schools than those in which they are ultimately placed and that  neighborhoods most in need of high quality school options are the ones  that are least represented in such institutions. This lack of equity is  highlighted in research findings that show 18 of the 21 neighborhoods  with the lowest college-readiness rates in New York City are in the Bronx  while 13 of the 15 neighborhoods with the highest college readiness rates  are in Manhattan.[1]   We will visit at least 15 schools in the neighborhoods listed in the study.

We have always had translators available at  our parent-teacher conference nights, but they are not as well utilized as they could be. This year, two  weeks prior to the conferences we will send more information home in the home language so that families  become more aware of this resource.   In previous years we have always had an automated call home for any student who was late or absent on a  given day. This year, we will track students who have been absent, and in a color-coated chart, note if they  have been absent more than five times in the year. For those students, we will make personalized phone  calls so that we talk directly to the parent or guardian. This will also give us the opportunity to use the  translation service so that we can reach the parent in their home language. This was not something we  were able to do using the automated feature.     Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment  Part 4a.

The academic program in the ninth and tenth grade at BHSECQ provides a rigorous preparation for college-level  work in the following two years. As demonstrated by programs such as the Diversity Initiative and the Learning  Commons tutoring system, BHSECQ is committed to supporting dedicated students who is traditionally  underrepresented in higher education. Teacher collaboration efforts in 2018-2019 will center on supporting the  growing cohort of students with non-traditional learning styles (which will continue to grow over time) who will  require an Integrated Co-teaching environment and the teachers working with them, and educating the faculty at  large on special education topics.   The Professional Development Committee will continue to provide time for all ICT teachers to meet and share best  practices and review the supports students with IEP's are receiving. In addition to this, workshop trainings will be  designed to continue our focus on supporting diverse learners in the classroom. This will include: using assistive  technology in the classroom, using protocols for ensuring all voices are heard, modeling and scaffolding tasks  within lessons, and expanding out checks for understanding.

Strengths:       Based on the NYC Schools Survey (2017-2018):     97% of parents feel that the principal “works to create a shared sense of community at the school.” Similarly,   97% of parents feel that the principal “promotes family and community involvement in the school.”     97% of teachers feel the principal works to create a sense of community in the school    At BHSECQ strong vision guides the work that we do to support our student’s learning and overall well being.   By offering public high school-age students a tuition-free college course of study in the liberal arts and  sciences, Bard Early Colleges seek to raise the quality and standards of secondary education and enable  students from all backgrounds to succeed in college, at Bard Early College campuses and beyond.     We act on this mission through three core principles:         Inspire and prepare high school-age students to become leaders across fields through a rigorous course of  study that emphasizes critical thinking, writing, inquiry, and discourse.  Increase college access, affordability, and completion for adolescents by allowing them to earn up to two  years of tuition-free, transferable Bard College credits and an Associate of Arts degree.     Bridge the gap between high school and college by bringing the key characteristics of liberal arts college   classrooms to public school settings.      Needs:      Based on the NYC Schools Survey (2017-2018), 68% of teachers feel that “once we start a new program, we   follow up to make sure that it’s working.”      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          30      Our instructional goal this year is to expand and strengthen our support of students with IEPs and teachers working  with them. More than 30% of our teachers feel that we need to ensure that our new programs are working. We will  build in measures to assess how effective we are at working with our increasing number of students with IEPs.              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  The administrative team will implement new measures that will include surveys of general education teachers and  the families of students with IEPs to get feedback so that we can adjust our action plan as needed. We will also  collect and make available to the faculty a collection of effective resources from the professional development  workshops.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          31     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41     State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Bard High School Early College Queens, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Bard High School Early College Queens will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;    ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;    ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;    ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;    ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;    The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.      In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:    ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;    ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;    ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;    ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;    ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;    ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;    ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;          Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;    ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;    ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;    ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;    ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;    ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;    ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;    ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress; and   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our Admissions assessment in English is used to assess the literacy skills of all applicants to Bard High School Early College  including our ELLs.  Students are expected to read from a literary work and to respond to it in an essay that reflects their voice  and understanding of the passage.  Students, including ELLs, who pass this portion of the assessment demonstrate excellent  writing skills.  In addition, the math skills of all applicants are assessed in a 30 question exam.  Students who pass both portion  of the written exam are then invited to an oral interview.  All students who are then admitted demonstrate their capacity to  perform high level work to be successful at Bard.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   A faculty member with certification to teach ELL students would be scheduled to meet with them to review work they are  doing in class, help to build vocabulary, and also enter into the classes to see how the student is doing in situ.  We have an ENL  teacher from our fourth floor school invited up to our school to teach a class during 4th period everyday.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Several measures indicate that the ELL students are doing well and thriving in our school program.  Their passing rate on the  state Regents exams and the grades on their report cards point to a successful learning experience at Bard High School Early  College.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Our Departments review summative assessment data and discuss how they will modify teaching strategies based on the data  and how they will monitor effectiveness of those strategies.  The School Goals for the year include ensuring equity of voice for  all students.  In practice this means we are monitoring and adjusting teaching protocols such that all students have an  opportunity to be equal participants in our classes.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   n/a at this time.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   In the past, data patterns across proficiency levels on the NYSESLAT and grades on state assessments reveal that our ELLs  progress in their English proficiency and succeed in their academic subject areas.  Previously, students who had taken the LAB- R exam (currently the NYSITELL) had all attained proficiency levels and were, therefore, not entitled to ESL services. This year  we had two students take the NYSITELL and they are at a commanding level.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   n/a at this time            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   All students, including ELLs, are placed in heterogeneous classes, except in Mathematics where high school students  are placed according to mathematical skills and knowledge based upon an initial placement test when they first enroll  in the school and upon assessments in the specific courses.           b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              When eligible, all ELLs are scheduled for mandated instructional time per proficiency level with an ENL teacher.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      English is the language of instruction for all content areas at Bard High School Early College Queens.  To make instruction  comprehensible and to enrich language development, teachers employ a variety of strategies in their instruction and in their  assignments. Seminar discussions, group work and lectures facilitate the development of speaking and listening skills. Daily  homework assignments and long-term research projects aid in the development of reading and writing skills.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELLs are given the opportunity to take the Regents in English in their native language, if available.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    For Long-Term ELLs, the guidance counselors track the academic progress of any student in this subgroup who is struggling or  who raises concern through “guidance screens” which solicit feedback from teachers about a student’s performance and they  review the narrative reports and grades that are given by instructors at mid-semester and at the end of the semester.  The  guidance counselors provide academic counseling to Long-Term ELLs in meetings with the students and with their  parents/guardians.  Also, a placement exam in Mathematics is administered when students initially enroll in the school.  On- going course assessments are used to determine the Long-Term ELL students’ academic needs in order to provide them with  the necessary support.  Tutoring services are available to this subgroup on both a voluntary and mandatory basis during the  school day and after school.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELLs-SWDs employ a variety of strategies in teaching this subgroup as well.  They utilize seminar discussion format,  ICT -classes, small and large group activities, small writing assignments and large writing projects among others.  Grade  appropriate and content rich text materials in each discipline are provided to these students to help them enhance their  English  language development as well as their knowledge in the content areas.             7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our Dean of Academic Affairs along with our special education team reviews the IEPs and 504s of ELLs-SWDs to recommend  faculty assignments and course placements to accommodate the special needs of this population.  In addition, the guidance  counselors track the academic progress of any student in this subgroup who is struggling or who raises concern through  “guidance screens” which solicit feedback from teachers about a student’s performance and they review the narrative reports  and grades that are given by instructors at mid-semester and at the end of the semester.  The guidance counselors provide  academic counseling to ELL-SWDs in meetings with the students and with their parents/guardians.  Also, a placement exam in  Mathematics is administered when students initially enroll in the school.  On-going course assessments are used to determine  the ELL-SWD students’ academic needs in order to provide them with the necessary support.  Tutoring services, ENL classes,  and the Read 180 software, are available to this subgroup on both a voluntary and mandatory basis during the school day and  after school.  All related services and accommodations are offered in compliance with IEPs/504s.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The ELL students are provided with additional support in ELA, math and other content areas  by staff in the Learning Commons  at our school.  These students can also receive one-on-one assistance from their instructors.  In addition to these voluntary  tutoring sessions, ELLs are also expected to attend mandatory tutoring sessions with their teachers or an assigned peer tutor.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      The school will continue to research and purchase instructional materials that would aid ELL students and the instructors of  the ELL students.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No programs or services for ELLs will be discontinued.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs are fully integrated into the school programs, thereby having equal access to all of them.  ELL students may take  advantage of all tutoring programs offered to all students in the Learning Commons during and after the school day.  In  addition, ELLs have equal access to computers and online resources in the school library, Computer Lab and classrooms.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials used to support ELLS include bi-lingual dictionaries and some textbooks that are at a lower reading  level.  There are also graphic novels of famous works (e.g. Darwin’s “Origin of the Species”) that aid those ELL students who  have a visual learning style.  In addition, the Library Director, Jessica deCourcy Hinds, selects databases with a translation  feature.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   There are dictionaries and reading materials in the native languages of ELLs in the school’s library.  The Library Director  continuously seeks to expand its collection of native language reading materials.     Dual language books in our library  collection include works in Korean, Spanish, Chinese, Polish and Arabic.  If it were necessary, a buddy system would also be  created whereby students speaking the same native language as the ELLs would provide additional support to their ELL  classmates.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The school attempts to provide instruction that meets ELLs’ grade level and age.  Because Bard High School is an early college,  it provides instruction and materials that are appropriate for highly motivated high school students which includes our ELL  population.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Instructional materials used to support ELLS include bi-lingual dictionaries and some textbooks that are at a lower reading  level.  There are also graphic novels of famous works (e.g. Darwin’s “Origin of the Species”) that aid those ELL students who  have a visual learning style.  In addition, the Library Director, Jessica deCourcy Hinds, selects databases with a translation  feature.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         The guidance counselors meet with newly enrolled ELLs in order to review each student’s program of study.  They work with  teachers to adjust expectations and assignments where appropriate. They also pair students with Peer Mentors when needed.  Before the start of the school year, incoming students, including ELLs, participate in a two-day orientation program.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish, Latin and Chinese are offered to all students including ELLs for all four years. Arabic is offered for the final two years  to all students.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?             N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ESL teacher attends conferences and workshops related to ELL pedagogy.  All teachers are encouraged to participate in ESL  professional development workshops offered by the Department of Education.  The school administration will continue to seek  the support of the Field Support Center on ELL related matters. And we utialize Doshka Truick as a resource.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.     To assist ELLs in their transition from middle to high school, all teachers learn about the demographics of our school  population. They are informed about the needs of the individual ELL students and collaborate with the guidance counselors in  making modifications to students’ course of study when necessary.  Teachers are also informed about test modifications for  ELL students.     When needed, the Foreign Language department will be asked to deliver professional development on strategies for teaching  ELLs at faculty/staff meetings during the year.  Topics will include differentiation of instruction and use of graphic organizers.  To supplement this professional development, teachers are encouraged to attend workshops on ESL offered by the  Department of Education.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56            Parents are involved in our school through different venues.  Parents, including parents/guardians of ELLs, are members of the  PTA and serve on the School Leadership Team.  On a more informal basis, they participate in after-school functions such as  “International Night” where they share food and artifacts representative of their culture and nationality.  Parents also  volunteer to assist in the library and as guest speakers.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The needs of parents are evaluated based upon surveys distributed by the Executive Board of the PTA .  In addition, some  parents take the initiative to contact the Parent Coordinator and administrators about their concerns and needs; the latter  assess the nature and extent of concerns and follow up with the appropriate actions.  All parental concerns are addressed in a  timely manner.  We utilize the on-demand translation services offered by the DOE through the phone lines for meetings with  parents.  We also use school messenger to deliver messages to all families in their home language.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Valeri Thomson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
