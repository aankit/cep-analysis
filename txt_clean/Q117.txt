This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   School Mission    Section 4: CEP Overview      Public School 117 Queens (P.S. 117Q) is the largest elementary school in District 28. The student population reflects  the diversity of New York City. Our Mission, “Achieving Excellence Together” is the following:   Our Mission is to provide maximum educational opportunities for all children at P.S. 117Q as we continue to strive to  improve the quality of teaching and learning while fostering respect for the diversity of our school population. We are   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      committed to enlisting the collaborative efforts of students, parents, teachers, supervisors and community members  to ensure excellence in achievement and equity in outcomes for all.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Contextual Information about the School’s Community and its Unique/Important Characteristics   The school administration and the professional staff have worked closely to achieve academic rigor and a high-level of  performance for our students. Our school leadership is actively involved in planning and reviewing our Instructional  Focus, annual school wide goals and objectives and addressing the tenets of Citywide Instructional Expectations. Our  parent coordinator, teachers, administration and parent association actively reach out to our parents and gain their  participation in events in support of our work. Through an interdisciplinary approach to instruction we celebrate  cultural diversity by integrating social studies, science and art into the reading and writing curriculum.    Our school’s continued progress is based on a literacy and math curriculum that recognizes and targets the needs of  all learners. Classroom teachers immerse students in an instructional program that is geared towards a balanced  literacy approach. All instructional staff actively participates in school-wide professional learning activities in order  support to our Instructional Focus, address the Strong Schools Strong Communities Framework, to foster a strong  sense of collaboration, which will result in improved academic performance, student targeted learning outcomes and  teacher practice. Through the implementation of the Reading/Writing Workshop Model, educators will assist  struggling learners, gifted and talented students, English Language Learners, and our entire general education  population. Our school-wide science program is an investigation, inquiry-based instructional approach. Students in  grades K-5 will utilize the Core-Curriculum Amplify Science program during the weekly instructional time. Students in  grades K-5 align all instructional units of study to the New York City K-8 Social Studies Scope and Sequence and they  utilize the Passport program.    Along with our commitment to academic achievement, our school has an after school arts program. A certified art  teacher provides a visual arts program for our students. Our partnership with City Lore, offers an opportunity for a  professional dance artist to work with our 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grade classroom teachers and students by teaching dance  aligned to a grade specific curriculum. During the 2018-2019 school year, students in the fifth grade will have an  opportunity to work alongside a resident dance artist from Dancing Classrooms where students learn various types of  dances; ballroom dancing, Merengue and African dance. This partnership will enable our children to focus on  interdisciplinary standard based lessons.    A grant provided by Councilman Lancman, will enable our students in grades four and five to participate in an after- school program provided by CUNY Cultural After School Adventures. Students attending this after school program will  be able to expand their cultural awareness by participating in and stimulating and activities, which will enable them to  address anti-bullying through the art form of drama.    As a school, we have cultivated a community partnership with the Briarwood Civic Association. Together, in the past  we have developed grants for an after school photography club, a math enrichment program and an oral and visual  history of the community.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our specific special student populations include English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities. These  learners are integrated into general education classrooms when the least restrictive environment is most appropriate  and co-teaching models are utilized to deliver instructional curriculum in all discipline areas.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      4.

However, administration would like to expand parental  involvement during designated times for families by increasing parental involvement by 10% school wide.      Based on the signatures from family sign in sheets from the 2017 - 2018, our school was able to obtain   records of parental involvement. Although the turn out was better than expected we still plan to increase the  number of parent involvement activities by grade so families become more familiar with specific content  areas, especially science and social studies. Content will be delivered through writing celebrations, a school  science fair and by incorporating meaningful cultural experiences     Based on School Leadership Team meetings, administration has asked for parent input in terms of family  participation with their child for school events. Our findings noted there is now more of a consistency for  classes on each grade in terms of writers celebrations and events which celebrate cultures but there is a need  for further implementation of teacher driven family engagement opportunities.     Ongoing Community Walk-throughs to monitor School Goals.

If your school received an allocation (please refer to the current Title I Funds Summary of School Allocation  Memorandum), include the amount your school received in this question.  If your school did not receive an allocation  and needs assistance in identifying resources to assist STH students, please contact an STH liaison.   We are indeed a Title I School. We don't receive a separate allocation as a result. We will continue to set aside money  for each student who lives in temporary housing as we are required to do so as a Title I school. We anticipate that we  will receive $100 per STH student as we have in the past.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      Directions:   Section 8: Title I Program Information         All Schools must indicate their Title I status in Part 1.    All elements of the All Title I Schools section must be completed in Part 2.    All Targeted Assistance (TA) Schools must also complete the TA Schools Only section in Part 3.    All Schoolwide Program (SWP) Schools must also complete the SWP Schools Only section in Part 4.     If a required component is addressed elsewhere in this plan, you may refer to the section(s) where the response  can be found.     For additional information, visit the Title I Intranet webpage.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).   Prekindergarten students are taught through the year how to take ownership of their environment and become  creative and curious learners.     Curriculum is designed so students are encouraged to learn within center exploration where the teacher and  assistant facilitate learning that is taking place.     Our teachers participate in professional development a minimum of four times during the school year to enrich the  understanding of social/emotional and academic learning. The PD sessions are then translated into classroom  practice.     Our Prekindergarten teachers lead our young students towards independence and feeling secure emotionally in the  classroom. In the beginning of the year children are assisted in many daily experiences- One example is how more  support is offered to children in the beginning of the year for things like zipping and buttoning their coats. By the  spring most students are able and encouraged to do this by themselves. Students are aware of where all materials are  and are able to access them as needed.    Our Prekindergarten teachers use Common Core alignment of instruction to meet all required standards by the end  of June. Thematic based activities drive instruction and promote an interdisciplinary content-based environment.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48       Our classroom teachers meet weekly with administration for professional learning sessions where PD is turn-keyed,  programmatic components are set in place and resources are shared.     Our Prekindergarten social worker visits our classroom twice each month to work with individual children, reach  out to families in need of services and to conduct parent workshops.     In the beginning of the school year parents are invited into our school for a Pre-Kindergarten Tea (orientation). This  Tea provides an opportunity for families to meet other families of the students who are in the same class.    Families are encouraged to share telephone numbers and form friendships outside school. Many of the children are  invited on play dates with other children thereby strengthening a strong friendship bond. Parents are invited to  attend the P.S. 117 crochet club where our Pre-Kindergarten social worker speaks with club members about a variety  of topics from social issues to academic concerns and ways to strengthen the home-school connection.     Towards the spring of the year, families are invited to attend a transition workshop hosted by administration. This  workshop helps to prepare parents with the expectations and routines for our kindergarten students. The children  and families are invited on a tour of the building to see kindergarten classrooms in action, various important locations  in the building- main office, gymnasium, computer lab, etc. so they become more familiar with the building and are  more easily adjusted for the beginning of the new school year.     In May, administration meets with our Prekindergarten teachers to discuss where students might best be suited in  kindergarten classes. Current friendships and teacher personalities are taken into account when determining  placement. The Prekindergarten teachers meet with Kindergarten teachers to forward student records.     The following September parents are invited to attend a Kindergarten orientation.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments:     In the beginning of the school year our teacher administers the ECERS screening to all PK students. Parents and  administration are all informed of the results. Based on the initial screening, students may be re-screened if needed.  This screening provides a baseline for our teacher in particular skills development.     During daily instruction, our teaching assesses students on an ongoing basis using multiple checks for  understanding. The teacher will facilitate centers, work with students in small groups and individually and take notes  on developmental and academic components. Our teacher utilizes Performance Assessments a minimum of three  times during the year using the NYC Core Library tools. The results from the Performance Assessments are analyzed  during pre, mid and post assessments that are developmentally appropriate.    Parents are given progress reports during the year so they are able to understand the progress their child is making  in the program. Prekindergarten newsletters are provided to families on a monthly basis to keep them aware of  happenings in the classroom and to provide helpful tips at home.     Teachers participated in decision-making process by participating in the MOSL Committee. MOSL committee  members participated in Webinar training before making important decisions regarding assessments for students and  assessments linked to Teacher Effectiveness.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49       All teachers meet weekly in Inquiry Teacher Teams, Grade Level Teams to create/modify in-house common  assessments. In addition all Teacher Teams meet weekly to analyze all common assessments linked to the CCLS.    Inquiry/Grade Level Teacher Teams meet weekly and assess students’ work during each six-week unit of study with  direct grade level supervisors. The ORID Protocol is utilized to assess class/individual student data.    Measures of Student Learning committee members selected local measure assessments.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50     identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. [P.S. 117Q] , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   [P.S. 117Q] will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community; and   - increasing family involvement by inviting parents to participate in our Instructional Learning Walks   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent-Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on  the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase  and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent- Teacher Association and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and ongoing professional  development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families.

This PK-5 school serves an ethnically  diverse population with Asian: 38% Black: 9% Hispanic: 35% White: 15%. Many of our  children are either new immigrants or first generation Americans.  There are various languages  spoken in our school.  The most predominant languages in our building are Spanish, Urdu,  Arabic, Bangla, Uzbek, and Russian.  There are currently 136 ELL students in attendance which  represents 12.1% of the student population.    Using the data from the Ell Data Analysis Tool, students selected for the upcoming ENL After  School Program are identified as subgroups with the largest number of ELL students, which are  the Newcomers and Developing students. Students were also selected based on their results from  their Teachers College Benchmark reading levels and data from the 2018 NYSESLAT.     The Title III program for the 2018-2019 school year is designed to provide supplemental services  to students in grades 3-5.  Our goal for this program is to promote the development of language  skills that will enable our ELLs to function effectively in the monolingual classroom and be able  to effectively perform in their classrooms as measured by the Common Core State Standards.  The program is created with the expectation that our ELLs will be comfortable and able to  contribute to the content being taught in their classrooms.    The ENL After School Program will focus mainly on increasing students’ English skills in the  four modalities: (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) with emphasis on phonological  awareness, letter/sound recognition, decoding, oral language, and early writing development. As  well as developing English academic language acquisition. For 30 minutes, students will engage  in language skills development using National Geographic Reach and supplemental instructional  materials from EngageNY. The remaining 30 minutes of the program will focus mainly on  literacy instruction that is skills based.  Using the NYS Bilingual Progressions and the Targets of  Measurements (TOMs) students will receive instruction aligned to the CCLS using cross cultural  themed lessons found in Engage NY. These units are an extension of the Social Studies  curriculum. During this time, we will provide small group instruction based on students’ needs.     The ENL After School Program will begin in December and end in April and will run for  approximately 22 sessions. The program will run from 2:20 pm - 4:00 pm, Wednesdays and  Thursdays. The program will be served by 4 teachers who hold NYS certification in TESOL  (Teaching English to Students of Other Languages) and 2 teachers who are common branch  certified.    Using the data from the Ell Data Analysis Tool (EDAT), students selected for the upcoming  ENL After School Program are identified as subgroups with the largest number of ELL students,  which are the Newcomers and Developing students,  this includes : Entering, Emerging, and  Transitioning students.The data obtained from the EDAT is then used to focus on the progress   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   toward achievement of proficiency for our specific subgroups of ELLs selected for the ENL  After School Program.  Using the EDAT we are then able to design effective instructional  program interventions for our target group. Students were also selected based on their results  from their Teachers College Benchmark reading levels and data from the 2018 NYSESLAT and  NYSITELL.     The ENL teachers and content teachers will be providing direct instruction to students through  various models.  There will be an ENL teacher and a content area teacher assigned to each  grade.  The students will be grouped based on their language proficiency level. Teachers will  initially begin each after school session using a team teaching approach to address the entire  class.  Teachers will collaborate to plan and share the instruction of all students. Using this  method both teachers will actively engage in conversation to encourage discussion by students.  During the course of the session students will engage in flexible grouping where teachers will  provide direct instruction through the use of targeted strategy lessons.     Our school is currently using the Free Standing ENL Program.    The Title III program for the 2018-2019 school year is designed to provide supplemental services  to students in grades 3-5.  Our goal for this program is to promote the development of language  skills that will enable our ELLs to function effectively in the monolingual classroom and be able  to effectively perform in their classrooms as measured by the Common Core State Standards.  The program is created with the expectation that our ELLs will be comfortable and able to  contribute to the content being taught in their classrooms. The ENL After School Program will  begin in December and end in April and will run for approximately 22 sessions. The program  will run from 2:20 pm -4:00 pm, Wednesdays and Thursdays. The program will be served by 4  teachers who hold NYS certification in TESOL (Teaching English to Students of Other  Languages)and 2 teachers who hold common branch licences.  Students will be grouped for  instruction based on their grade levels.  Based on our population, there will be one class per  grade.  The ENL students will be taught by both an ENL teacher and a content area teacher.  The  ratio of teacher to students to certification is as follows:  20 students: 1 ENL teacher  20 students: 1 Common Branch Teacher     Student attendance will be taken daily.  The teachers providing instruction will track student  attendance on a school created attendance form.  Letters sent to parents in their preferred  languages will be maintained in the office.  A copy of the letter will also be placed in the ENL  Title III  binder.  Records such as conference notes, teacher observations, and flexible small  group instruction will be saved and maintained.

All professional development sessions will be conducted by the ENL Department. These  sessions will be held on Mondays during professional development hours as planned by  administration. Each session will last 45 minutes to one hour. During the professional  development session we will discuss ways of incorporating the Bilingual Progressions and  Common Core State Standards into daily instruction. All agendas and attendance sheets will be  keep on file by the school and a copy will be kept in the ENL Professional Development  Binder.The following PD sessions will be open to all content area and classroom teachers to  support ELLs in the development of academic language using ENL techniques. Our purpose is to  ensure that teachers as well as our ELL students feel confident and are capable in functioning  effectively in their classrooms. These professional development sessions will positively impact  the progress of ELLs by helping teachers feel supported by providing strategies and resources  that are readily accessible to them. Additionally, it will also be a time when teachers can  comfortably share their ideas and concerns. The ENL and classroom teachers will work  collaboratively to ensure that all the needs of ELLs are met and that every scaffold is in place so  our ELLs may successfully continue to flourish in their classrooms.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  As a school, we use TCRWP Running Record assessments to gauge the reading levels of all General Education students, English  Language Learners and Students with Disabilities.  At the end of every TC unit of study, teachers use TC generated rubrics and  checklists to assess students progress in both reading and writing. Running Records are given five times during the school year.  Students are also instructed to self and peer assess using student friendly rubrics and checklists.  The math assessments used  for our school are from the Go Math program.  These assessments include pre and post assessments.  All assessments are  aligned to the Common Core Standards. In addition students are assessed on an ongoing basis in the content areas using  teacher created assessments.  The data enables teachers to plan whole class, small group, and one to one instruction.  Specifically for newly enrolled ELL students, the NYSITELL is used as a baseline assessment to help us meet the needs of all new  coming ELLs. For the 2017-2018 school year we administered both the Fall and Spring English Language Learners Baseline   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      Assessment in speaking, listening, reading, and writing. At the end of the school year ELLs are assessed using the NYSESLAT.  The results from the NYSESLAT are then used to place students in the correct ELL designated classroom and provide the  mandated minutes of ELL instruction.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teachers are provided with TCRWP assessments online as well as hard copies on file in the Test Coordinators room.   ENL  teachers and classroom teachers assess their students on an ongoing basis and enter their results into assessment pro.  When  administering the TC Running Records students are assessed on an individual basis. The final Running Record is administered  and scored by a disinterested teacher. Teachers administer Go Math assessments before and after each unit.  If available the  assessments are provided in students’ home language.  Glossaries in the home language are provided for students when applicable. Data gathered from the assessments are used to  create student math centers and math tool-kits based on their academic needs.  ENL teachers collaborate with classroom  teacher during professional activity period to modify curricula and plan targeted small group instruction.  In addition the  testing coordinator works with the ENL teachers to ensure that all students are provided with their correct Ell  accommodations on all formative assessments.  These accommodations include bilingual glossaries, extended time, oral  translations if available, and separate location. For state assessments such as ELA, Math, Science, NYSITELL, and NYSESLAT all  teachers are flexible in terms of scheduling to ensure all students are tested with appropriate testing accommodations. Once  the results from all formative assessments are known, teachers create and modify lessons, unit plans, and instruction to meet  the needs of all students. Classroom teachers work collaboratively with support staff to create lessons aligned to the Common  Core State Standards and units of study. In addition, teachers engage in grade level teacher teams to plan and adjust  instruction to best meet the needs of students.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Summative assessments include the NYS ELA, NYS Mathematics, NYSESLAT, MOSL, ELA Benchmark, and Math Benchmark.  The  data from these assessments level are then used to monitor students’ progress and areas of needs throughout the school  year.  An item analysis of each question informs classroom teachers and support staff of which common core state standards  the students excel in and which ones they need further instruction.  In addition periodic assessments in math and reading are  given to track student growth. For the 2017-2018 school year we administered both the Fall and Spring English Language  Learners Baseline Assessment in speaking, listening, reading, and writing. At the end of the school year ELLs are assessed using  the NYSESLAT. The results from the NYSESLAT are then used to place students in the correct ELL designated classroom and  provide the mandated minutes of ELL instruction.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered the administrators analyze the findings and calculate the percentages of students  below grade level, at grade level, and on grade level.  Teaches are then provided with the scores of their students and are able  to create flexible groups.  Teachers look at the data using a focused conversation data analysis called the ORID protocol.  Teachers use ELA and math tool-kits to address the needs of students.  Students engage in a six-eight week learning cycle that  is supplemented with supports to improve areas of concern.  Supports include small group instruction, one-to-one instruction,  learning centers, self reflections,  and peer reflections. Teachers work collaboratively to create additional supports for  students.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school uses data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention framework by identifying ELLs who fit  the criteria for RTI Tier II and III Interventions. These students are provided with literacy instruction using research based  programs, Fountas and Pinnell, Leveled Literacy Intervention, Wilson and Fundations. Data from NY State ELA tests, and  TCRWP Running Records along with teacher consultations and data enable administrators to target students for RTI services.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Assessments that are used to evaluate and inform our ELL programs include the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, and NYS ELA  exams.  Using various reports from ATS  including RLAT and ELPC we are able to place students in the correct setting.  Data  gathered from the RLAT allows classroom and support staff to track students growth and areas of concern in order to make  adjustments in ELL programs.  We use the ELL Parent Survey to track the percentages of parent choice in terms of ELL  program.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   As a school the administrators gather and analyze the results from summative assessments including; NYSESLAT, ELA and  Math.  We look for areas of progress and areas of concerns for all students.  We share the finds with our teachers and support  staff during the beginning of the school year.  We then are able to use this data as an area of focus to form vertical inquiry  teams.  Teachers use the data to create small group instruction and use it as a starting point for the school year.  Using the  Common Core Learning Standards, Bilingual Progressions, and summative assessments teachers collaborate on the grade to  make adjustments to unit plans.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Freestanding ENL program- ENL instruction is delivered through a push in and pull out model in alignment with CR  Part 154.  Students in grades K-5 are placed in an ELL designated classroom.  There are two ELL classrooms in  Kindergarten and one ELL classroom in grades 1-5.  Students are grouped heterogeneously by proficiency  levels.  Using the guideline in the ELL Policy and Reference Guide, students are identified as Entering or Emerging are  provided with 2 units of push in integrated ENL instruction per week and 2 units of standalone ENL instruction per  week.  When students are receiving standalone ENL instruction they travel with their classmates to the ENL teacher’s  room where explicit ENL instruction is delivered. Students who are identified as transitioning and expanding are  provided with 1 unit of integrated ENL instruction per week.  Commanding students receive ½ a unit of integrated ENL  in ELA or another content area.  A teacher certified in TESOL works with the classroom teachers to provided  instruction for ELLs.  Students who are ELLs and also have an IEP are placed in the correct setting based on their  IEP.  They also receive their mandated times of ENL instruction based on their language proficiency level.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   PS 117 ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided to all ELLs according to their proficiency  levels.  P.S. 117 currently only offers Freestanding English as a New Language program for all ELLs. Currently, we do not have a  Dual Language or Transitional Bilingual Programs. The ENL teachers review the scores from the RLAT report to identify the  proficiency levels of all ELLs. Once the data has been reviewed and analyzed the ENL teaches in collaboration with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      administrators place the ENL students in the grade appropriate designated ENL class. Students who have IEP’s and are ELLs are  placed in their correct setting.   ENL teachers create their program schedules to accurately provide services to students based  on proficiency levels using the guidelines from CR-Part 154 and the ELL Policy and Reference Guide.  Once students have been  placed in the correct setting, we enter their information into STARS to ensure all students are receiving their mandated ENL  minutes. Students who are identified as Entering or Emerging are provided with 180 minutes of integrated ENL instruction  with the classroom teacher and certified ENL teacher. Entering and Emerging students are also provided with 180 minutes of  stand-alone ENL with the ENL teacher. Resulting in 360 minutes of ENL instruction for all Entering and Emerging students.  Students who are identified as Transitioning or Expanding are provided with 180 minutes of integrated ENL instruction in the  classroom setting. Students who are identified as commanding are given 90 minutes of integrated ENL instruction for two  years after being identified as commanding. Integrated instruction is conducted in the content areas of reading and writing.  The classroom teacher and ENL teacher provide instruction using various co-teaching models such as Parallel Teaching, Team- Teaching, One Teach-One Assist, Alternative Teaching, and Station Teaching. The method of co-teaching is adjusted based on  the lesson and needs of students. During Stand-Alone Instruction the ENL teacher focuses on language development with an  emphasis on reading, writing, listening, and speaking.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      PS 117 has three ENL teachers that provided integrated ENL/ELA instruction along with the classroom teacher. Our school  has a Freestanding ENL Program.  In our ENL program, core content is delivered through scaffolded and modified lessons  based on Teachers College Reading and Writing Curricula. We use the Bilingual Common Core Progressions to adapt our  lessons to meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards and make content comprehensible so that all ELLs can  further develop their Language Acquisition. ENL instruction is delivered through various collaborative teaching methods.  English is used as our primary language of instruction. However, home language support is provided through various tools and  methods. Students who are able to read in their first language are given dual language books to facilitate a smooth transition  to English. Instructional materials include the use of Smart Board technology, Elmos, Laptops, Mac computers, and iPads.  Classrooms have a SmartBoard which is used interactively by the teacher and students. Litearcy instruction on the SmartBoard  often involves the use of the Internet to provide rich, visual supports around various literacy genres in the form of ebooks.  Students are able to utilize Mac computers, iPads, and laptop technology to engage in research based work for content areas.  Instructional materials also include teacher created charts that are displayed around the classroom and used as instructional  tools and points of reference as students work independently. Elmos are used to display problems and enable students to  show their work.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   We ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year by administering the Spanish  LAB.  When we enroll a student who is identified as an ELL and whose home language is Spanish, they are given the Spanish  LAB. Students can take their math and science tests in their home language when accessible and available. Go Math  assessments are also provided in Spanish.   As of now no further evaluations are provided in any other language.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       Teachers differentiate instruction during balanced literacy by conducting  small group instruction according to students  strengths and weaknesses, utilizing guided reading strategies, read alouds, shared reading, and shared writing instruction  according to their ELL subgroup classifications.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         a. For students who have been identified as SIFE instruction is differentiated in many ways to meet their academic and social  needs.  To begin we will determine SIFE status by following the SIFE Identification Process as outlined in the ELL Policy and  Reference Guide.  In addition, the LENS assessment is administered to get a better understanding of the student's’ academic  level.  Once SIFE status is determined we modify instruction according to their home language and needs using scaffolding  techniques and various multi-media components.  SIFE students also receive extra individual conferencing and small group  instruction with the ENL teacher and the classroom teacher.  Using the NYS Bilingual Common Core Progressions we are able  to promote academic success.  b. For ENL students who are identified as a Newcomer, we use the results of the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT to focus on their  specific language acquisition needs. To differentiate instruction for Newcomers, we use visual aids, gestures, and interactive  video clips and websites. If students are literate in their home language, students are provided with individualized glossaries in  their home language.They are also provided with a personal word wall.     c. For ENL students who are identified as Developing, we use the results of the NYSESLAT and ELA to target the specific needs  of that student. We also use baseline assessments, MOSL, and pre and post assessments to individualize lessons and small  groups for this group of students.     d. Currently we do not have any ENL students who are identifed as Long Term. However, if a student is identified as a long  term ELL we would provide rigorous instruction by collaborating with the classroom teacher to ensure all scaffolds and  modificationsare in placed to measure students’ strengths and needs in English language development and to serve as a  resource to help plan individual and group instruction.    e. Former ELLs are provided with services up to two years after exiting ELL status.  They are given .5 unit per week of  integrated ELA/ENL instruction.  They are provided with necessary scaffolds to ensure a smooth transition from their ELL  status.           6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL-SWDs are provided with integrated ENL/ELA instruction along with the classroom teacher. Core content is delivered  through scaffolded and modified lessons based on Teachers College Reading and Writing Curricula. All teachers are provided  with a hard copy of the TC Units of study along with the anchor books for each unit.  Rubrics and assessments are modified to  reflect language acquisition and IEP goals for students.  We use the Bilingual Common Core Progressions to adapt our lessons  to meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards and make content comprehensible so that all ELL-SWDs can  further develop their Language Acquisition. Instructional strategies are used during the three phases of instruction; preparing  to learn, interacting with the text, and extending the learning.  Visuals, explicit teaching, and TPR techniques are used as  connections to accelerate English language development.  Students also work in collaborative groups to promote academic  discussions.  As a school we are moving towards creating learning opportunities through project based learning. This method  will allow English language learners to have a deeper understanding of content related subjects. Computer based programs  such as Imagine Learning, DuoLingo, BrainPop, and Starfall are used in the classroom to promote English language  development.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexability to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain  English proficiency within the least restrictive environment.  ENL providers push-in  SWD classrooms to reduce teacher to  student ratio to provide individualized support for the SWD students.  ENL teacher and Special Education teacher meet to  review the students IEP goals and make adaptations to lessons, units, and assessments as needed.  Teacher use detailed  information from the IEP and other assessments to gather data about their students’ strengths and needs in English language  development to serve as a resource to help plan individual and small group instruction.  ELLs who are also students with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      disabilities (SWD) receive accommodations that apply both to ELLs and SWDs, as appropriate.  We are mindful and aware of  students' modifications and needs.  Therefore, when creating schedules we create settings that are appropriate for them.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  All ELL subgroups are invited to attend the Afterschool program as a form of intervention.  All ELL subgroups are also given  equal access to receive AIS interventions in both ELA and Math if students demonstrate a need in that area.  These  interventions are offered in ELA and in math with home language support through student partnerships, bilingual glossaries,  cultural books, and a classroom environment supporting second language acquisition.  AIS interventions include Wilson's  Fundations and Fountas and Pinnell Level Literacy Intervention Program.   We also have implemented RAZ-Kids, Reading A-Z.  com, IXL, and MyOn.  These interventions are accessible to students in school and at home.  For ELLs who are classified as  Newcomers, they are also provided with the Sadlier Phonics program.  This intervention allows our newcomers to get a basic  foundations of phonics and vocabulary.  For ENL students who are identified as Newcomers, we also use the results of the  NYSITELL, NYSESLAT and ELL Periodic Baseline Assessment to focus on their specific language acquisition needs. To  differentiate instruction for Newcomers, we use visual aids, gestures, and interactive video clips and websites. If students are  literate in their home language, students are provided with individualized glossaries in their home language.They are also  provided with a personal word wall. For students who are identified as developing ELLs, we provide them equal access to the  curricula.  We ensure this by using targeted language objectives in ELA and math.  We use the results of the NYSESLAT, ELA and  Math State Test to target the specific needs of that student. We also use baseline assessments, MOSL, and pre and post  assessments to individualize lessons and small groups for this group of students.  ENL students who are identified as a Long  Term ELL are provided rigorous instructio. ENL teachers work collaboratively with the classroom teacher to ensure all scaffolds  and modifications are in placed. These scaffolds and modifications are used to measure students’ strengths and needs in  English language development and to serve as a resource to help plan individual and group instruction.  Students who are  identified as Former ELLs are provided with services up to two years after exiting ELL status. They are given .5 unit per week of  integrated ELA/ENL instruction. These students are provided with necessary scaffolds to ensure a smooth transition from their  ELL status. All ELL intervention programs utilized in the building are provided in English. However, student resources such as  bilingual dictionaries, books, and Google translate are available in their home languages if necessary.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on the data and trends, we are incorporating new programs and making adjustments for the upcoming school year.  We  are implementing the Sadlier Phonics program for Newcomer students in grades K-4 to aid them in gaining a foundation in  phonics and vocabulary. We have also begun to use RAZ-Kids for ELL students in all grades to support reading strategies,  reading comprehension and listening modality skills. In addition the ENL teachers will deliver instruction utilizing a variety of  researched based co-teaching methods.  This school year students will have access to the following technology tools:  myOn  Reader, Front Row, Imagine Learning, Raz Kids and Reading A-Z. Teachers will continue to modify language objectives as a  source of support for ELLs  during mini-lessons.  We will also continue to have an ELL vertical team that will consist of the  classroom teachers who have the ENL students in their class and the ENL teachers.  This will provide a designated time for  teachers to collaborate and make teaching adjustments based on TESOL strategies and best practices.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All English Language Learners are afforded equal access to all school curricula, programs, and facilities.  The school’s policy is to  provide equity in all instructional programs during the regular school hours.  This includes small group instruction, modified  individual instruction, and  academic interventions. Current and Former English Language Learners are afforded equal access  to all school curricula, programs, intervention services, and facilities. The school policy is to provide equity in all instructional  and extracurricular activities during and after the regular school hours through Universal Design for Learning (UDL), and best  teaching practices.  All ELLs in grades 2-5 are invited to Title III After School Program, which focuses on NYSESLAT, ELA and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      Math support. All ELLs are invited to The Magnet Program, which is an after school program for arts and drama, also to the  KAVA Art program, and the AIS Program which is targeted support for ELA and Math.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials used to support ELLs in all subgroups include the use of Smart Board technology, Elmos, Lap tops and  Mac computers. Classrooms have a SmartBoard which is used interactively by the teacher and students. Litearcy instruction on  the SmartBoard often involves the use of the Internet to provide rich, visual supports around various literacy genres in the  form of ebooks. Students are able to utilize Mac computers and laptop technology to engage in research based work for  content areas to develop literacy skills. Instructional materials also include teacher created charts that are displayed around  the classroom and used as instructional tools and points of reference as students work independently. Language materials that  are used include DuoLingo app, google translate, Starfall.com, MyOnReader, Endless Reader app, and SMART Exchange.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We currently do not have a Dual Language or TBE program at our school; therefore Home Language support is delivered in the  Freestanding ENL integrated program through the use of bilingual glossaries and dictionaries, bilingual classroom library books,  interactive multilingual word walls and home language student partnerships. At this time the only home language that is  assessed is Spanish. All students that have Spanish as a home language are assessed using the Spanish LAB, which is  administered at the time of enrollment.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   Our school ensures that all required services/ resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels through  collaboration with classroom teachers. Together the ENL teachers and classroom teachers modify lessons, create targeted  small groups for instruction and coordinate efforts that make all grade level supports easily accessible for every ELL student.  Materials and resources used in the classroom are carefully selected to ensure that they are grade and age appropriate and  will accommodate the language acquisition needs of the ELL students in each proficiency level. Specific websites and apps such  as Starfall.com and Endless Reader were used and are geared towards ELLs in grades K-2. Other resources such as DuoLingo  App, MyOn Reader, and google translate were also used with ELLs and are geared toward grades 3-5.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   To help assist our newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year as well as the ENL students who enroll  throughout the school year,  the ENL teachers hand out a “Welcome Packet” that includes a current school calendar, list of  school supplies needed for the school year, pencils, a list of resources parents can use to help their child throughout the school  year,  any school flyers with events happening that month. A contact list with names and email addresses of the ENL Teachers  is also included should the parents have any questions before the beginning of the school year or throughout the school year.  Parents are also invited to Parent Orientation so they can become acquainted with the ENL staff and school procedures. The  ENL Teachers also conduct ongoing Parent Orientations as needed for newly enrolled ELLs throughout the school year. In  addition, the ENL teachers continue to outreach to parents to discuss the student’s progress during Parent Engagement time.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    No language electives are offered to ELLs at this time.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71         c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development is offered and will be provided during Monday Professional Learning time, Professional Activity  periods, and through Teachers College Staff Development days. At the beginning of the school year, teachers of ELLs are  invited to attend a professional development presented by the ENL department titled “ENL 101” that reviews ELL programs  and policies.  Teachers will also be given a needs survey in order for the ENL staff to create bi-monthly professional  development sessions. Teachers will be offered targeted professional developments based on their responses from the survey.  In addition, ENL teachers and classroom teachers with ELL students will attend off site professional development at Teachers  College as well as attend PDs with a TC Staff Developer who visits our school.  ENL teachers and classroom teachers with ELLs  will continue to attend professional development offered by the Department of Education’s Office of English Language  Learners and Boro Support Staff. Assistant Principals will continue to attend workshops pertaining to ELL policies, procedures,  and best instructional practices to turn key pertinent information on ELLs to all instructional staff.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    P.S.117 ensures that the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2 are met for all teachers by keeping  accurate records of professional development activities. All teachers are provided various professional development activities  through webinars, workshops and inter-school visitations. Both ENL and general education classroom teachers are encouraged  to participate in professional development offered by Teachers College Reading and Writing project, The Department of  Education’s Office of English Language Learners and Boro Support Staff.  Agendas, attendance sign-in sheets and minutes are  stored in binders as part of our school’s Professional Development Plan.              Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents at P.S.117 play an integral part in the academic and social growth of students. The parents and families of our ELL  students are invited to attend annual individual meetings with their perspective ENL teacher on Tuesdays, during Parent  Engagement Time. The ENL teachers create appointments and send out invitations, which are translated into the parent’s  preferred language, to parents with their scheduled time. At these meetings, the ENL teachers and parents of ELLs discuss  goals of the program, language development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development  needs in all content areas. ENL teachers create a presentation for ELL parents, after the presentation parents are invited to  participate in an Question & Answer session. Parents are given the opportunity to address any questions or concerns they have  to the ENL teachers at these meetings. In addition, the ENL Department sends out a monthly newsletter to parents informing  of the current unit of study and activities planned according to the unit. If interpretation is needed, there are qualified staff   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72            members who assist during the meeting or over-the-phone interpreters, Language Line, are used. Documents that are  provided at the meetings are translated into various home languages as needed for the parents.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The parents and families of our ELL students at P.S.117 are invited to attend all school functions, such as Parent-Teacher  Association meetings, parent workshops on literacy, mathematics, Common Core Learning Standards and NYS testing. There  are also monthly “Coffee and Conversation with the Principal” which allows parents to ask clarifying questions and offer input  to administration on school issues and concerns. Additionally, ENL teachers collaboratively work with classroom teachers to  ensure that all parents of ELLs are informed, invited and encouraged to attend all classroom celebrations, such as End-of- Unit  writing celebrations, assemblies, and any other family event at the school. Thus fostering ELL parental involvement for parents  of all ELLs in our school, for all school events, and ensuring that they feel welcomed and involved in their child’s education.     Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    PS 117 has three ENL teachers that provided integrated ENL/ELA instruction along with the classroom teacher. Our school has a  Freestanding ENL Program.  In our ENL program, core content is delivered through scaffolded and modified lessons based on  Teachers College Reading and Writing Curricula. We use the Bilingual Common Core Progressions to adapt our lessons to meet the  demands of the Common Core Learning Standards and make content comprehensible so that all ELLs can further develop their  Language Aquisition. ENL instruction is delivered through various collaborative teaching methods. English is used as our primary  language of instruction.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Paula Cunningham, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Joyce Keld                                                                              School DBN: 28Q117  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Data used to assess language preferences of the parent community are as follows: The Home Language Surveys  are used to as a written form of evidence of the parents preferred form of communication. The final two  questions on the back of the HLIS determine how parents prefer to be contacted with school staff and how they  would like to receive written information from the school. As the Home Language Survey is being completed the  ENL teacher interviews the parent to ensure the correct language will be used for communication between the  school and parents. This information is then inputted to ATS. We also refer to various ATS reports such as the  RPOB to ensure all documents are sent in the correct language. The emergency blue card for every student is also  completed during the registration process. We ensure the parents preferred language both oral and written are  completed during this time.    When parents who speak a language other then English, arrive into the main office they are able to communicate  with staff members using the DOE language cards. The DOE language cards are placed on the counter and parents   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76      can point to their language of choice. From that point we can either outreach to a staff member who speaks that  language or contact the language translation interpretation unit.           2.
