This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission Statement:    Section 4: CEP Overview      At Nicholas Herkimer School, P.S/I.S 155, we believe that student learning is the chief priority, and that all students  can learn to their highest potential. Our mission and responsibility are to rigorously challenge and engage all students  through multiple entry points, and questioning techniques so that all students will attain higher levels of achievement.  Working within that community, our students will develop their individual talents, critical thinking and technology   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      skills. Our continuous commitment to improvement will ensure that our students are well rounded, self-direct lifelong  learners who will leave us with the necessary tools and skills needed for College and career readiness.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS/IS 155 The Nicholas Herkimer School is currently a pre K-8 school with 411 students located in Brownsville  Brooklyn. Beginning September 5, 2018 we will transition to a 3K -8 school with the addition of 2 full time 3k classes  of 15 students each. The school population is comprised of 54.7% African Americans, 41.5% Hispanic, 1.5% Asian and  0.8% White. The student body includes 15% Limited English Proficient and 18.7% Students with Disabilities. Boys  account for 52% and girls account for 48%. The average attendance rate for year 2017-2018 was 88.3%      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   PS/IS155K has one of the largest "Students in Temporary Housing (STH)" populations. We are currently at 79 students  overall in STH. The students are in need of Academic Intervention Services, Attendance Improvement monitoring and  At Risk Counseling Services. Our school also has a large ELL population comprised of 17% of the students at PS/IS155K.  The majority of the students arrive speaking little to no english and must receive services in the native language. The  students attend ENL services until they reach a commanding language status and pass the NYSELAT exam.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Rigorous Instruction:    ● Continue to develop effective teaching practices through ongoing differentiated Professional Development on what  effective teaching practices should be implemented. This will include training that leads to in-depth discussions  among students from formulated higher-order questioning. Teacher Team meetings are conducted bi-monthly where  specific student data is analyzed and teachers identify and record gaps between what students know and what they  need to know. Actions are put into place in their instructional practice to meet the needs of each student.   Curriculum planning is conducted monthly using the information gathered from the student assessments recorded  into teacher record keeping files.   ● Strategically use the Charlotte's Danielson rubric to provide targeted and timely feedback on the necessary areas in  order to strengthen teacher practice around our identified areas of instructional focus. In addition, it is also used in  building teachers’ abilities to design cohesive, rigorous, engaging lessons which contain multiple entry points aligned  to the Common Core Learning Standard that promote students’ critical thinking skills.    ● Teachers collect formative data from the 2017-2018 Benchmark ELA and Mathematics exams and Summative 2017-  2018 New York State ELA and Mathematics exams data in which teachers gather evidence of student learning,  evaluate student progress against key standards and adjust lessons/unit plans to meet the needs of all students.  During data team meetings teachers review student work and plan coherent rigorous strategies to close the  instructional gap. This data revealed that we have "exceeded" the ELA targeted student achievement metrics and we  are "approaching" the targeted Mathematics achievement metrics.   ● Rubrics created by teachers or extracted from core curriculum resources are utilized and attached to student work  with teacher comments and clear next steps for improvement.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      * Concentrate on developing writing across the curriculum to engage and build powerful writers in Elementary and  Middle School Grades.      Supportive Environment:   ● In collaboration with parents, students, Community Based Organizations (CBO) and all stakeholders create a school  wide culture of conduct that reinforces City Wide Behavioral Expectations to support student learning.   ● Celebrate student accomplishments through positive teacher feedback, classroom share fairs, ongoing parent  contact calls, monthly student award recognition assembly programs and morning circle pep rally.   ● Build our work around Social Emotional Learning based on feedback from referrals, incidents, informal  conversations with community stakeholders, New Chancellors initiative Universal Literacy Coaches, , Single Shepherd  Program and Bridge the Gap Social worker. The development of a proactive approach promotes positive character  building for all students in 3K for All through eighth grade.   * Incorporate a focus on "Mental Health" using curriculum for all grades provide by DOE. Implementation will begin  with training for staff to recognize signs of distress and a need for intervention.   Collaborative Teachers:   ● Common planning time embedded into the daily schedule to analyze data and student work.   ● Collaborative planning opportunities provide teachers the opportunity to develop strategies to improve students’  proficiency levels and articulate next steps for improvement and share professional practices.    ● Provide weekly extended day differentiated professional learning opportunities for teachers to share reflections  and feedback on best practices.   * Provided opportunities to meet and collaborate with teachers from other neighborhood schools.   * Encourage self improvement activities, professional learning opportunities and conferences.   Effective School Leadership:   ● We will conduct Initial Planning Conferences, Mid-Year self-assessments as well as End-Term Conferences that will  allow us to set and monitor goals and provide teachers with feedback related to Domain 1-Planning and Preparation,  Domain 2- Classroom Environment, Domain 3- Instruction and Domain 4- Professional Responsibility.   ● Conduct formal and informal observations and provide targeted timely feedback in order to build teacher capacity  in the focus areas throughout the year.   * Create an environment of shared decision making with school families.   * Attend District/Citywide led Professional Development that increases knowledge base to build   capacity within the school.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Strong Family-Community Ties:   ● PTA   ● 21 st Century parent involvement   ● Community Forum & Multicultural Festival   ● NED Program (Never giving up, Encourage others & Doing your best)   ● Weekly Parent Engagement conferences   ● Annual Breast Cancer Walk   ● Annual Curriculum Fair   ● Annual Open House   ● Annual Career Day   * Monthly Principal's Breakfast   * Communication systems to parents/guardians: Class Dojo, Sonarcloud, FACEBOOK Page.   * ESL Classes for the community      Nicholas Herkimer School/PS/IS 155 School Strength:   ● Trust: 95% Parent-teacher trust    93% Parent-Principal trust   86% student-teacher trust   90% Teacher principal trust   95% Teacher-Teacher trust      ● 21 st Century Community Learning Center Grant: The leadership program will be the School Based Lead  Community Based Organization housed in PS/IS155 under the Community Schools Partnership.

Indicate the data trends, source and year.     2017-2018 Quality Review Report      Growth   The school leaders and staff make purposeful decisions to align curricula to the Common Core Learning Standards and  include rigorous habits, higher-order skills and the instructional shifts. All classrooms educators design lessons and  implement the "Gradual Release Model" in classroom instruction. The teacher models examples for students during  whole group instruction and then allows the students to engage in collaborative work in groups or pairs before  releasing fully to complete individual independent work. Teachers create scaffolds and multiple entry points to  individualize instruction and provide rigor to meet the needs of each child. Although this area of the Framework is  strong for most educators, 2nd year or teachers rated developing would benefit from further opportunities to work  with colleagues on planning and revising to ensure access to curricula and cognitive engagement for all students.       Next Steps   The School Leader and the Assistant Principal will schedule further opportunities for educators to meet, where they  are able to plan towards the curricula for students and revise plans to meet students needs.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  The Pre-K staff holds an annual Parent meeting during the month of September in which families receive a  comprehensive overview of Pre-K expectations. The Pre-K teachers, Early Childhood social worker and school nurse  conduct yearly meetings to educate parents about student expectations and developmental stages Pre-K students  encounter through the academic process. Teachers screen all students using the ESI-R to capture developmental  learning delays, gifted and whether English language acquisition support is needed. This screening tool also helps the  teachers better meet their students’ needs and individualize instruction. In order to provide students with services  that will enhance their learning abilities. The teachers will meet with parent and social worker make referrals to the  Committee on Preschool Special Education for possible early intervention services.

The teachers meet with their administrators to  review the ECERS-R report in order to make certain that their Pre-kindergarten classroom is providing the foundation  of skills and the knowledge necessary to set their students on the path for College and career. In addition to the  aforementioned, the pre-school teachers are being trained in the Work Sampling System (WSS). The WSS is an  authentic, performance-based assessment that provides teachers with the framework to strategically document  students’ behavior, knowledge and approaches to learning. The teachers are being trained to observe their individual  students to ensure that the instruction is meeting the needs of all students. The Preschool classroom teachers invite  parents to the classroom for special performances and in-house classroom trips so that parents have the opportunity  to extend learning at home.    -        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The Measure of Student Learning Committee selected the MOSL for this school year in consultation with the Principal.    PD regarding the MOSL will be conducted for teachers during the initial PD in September 2018. In addition, grade  teams along with the Coaches examine the item skills analysis data from ELA and Math exams to decide which specific  learning standards to focus on during planning for instruction.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39        Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Nicholas Herkimer School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A  of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Nicholas Herkimer School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   Community school partnerships allow students to benefit from extended learning time through academic tutoring,  enrichment, and extra-curricular activities that are grounded in sports, arts, technology, Science and wellness.  Community organizations such as the Leadership Program, Vision Inc. and Children Achieving Results Effectively  (CARE), Cook Shop, partner with the school to enrich the experiences of our students and their families.    This allows for deeper engagement and more meaningful partnerships with parents and the community as is  evidenced in the School surveys.    Students who are part of the program also show an overall higher level of attendance and academic progress.        Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    By year end, the school will improve overall student attendance and academic performance through a 10% increase in  the number of participants in the extended learning programs by including first grade and through heavy recruitment  of student participants amongst all grades.      By year end, and through an increase in the number of participants in the program, parent engagement will increase  by 5% as will be evidenced through increased participation in parent workshops.         Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  Attendance is an important indicator of academic success, when students are in school they learn, hence an increase  in attendance in the program will lead to an overall increase in student attendance. Having multiple layers of service  for students allow for a second layer of attendance accountability and mentorship.         Part 2 – Community School Partnerships Core Services Action Plan   Part 2a. Identify the Community-based Organization (CBO) partnerships that you will develop in ELT, Attendance  Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & Wellness, their target student population(s), and scope of the services  provided. As well as supporting schools’ supportive environment and attendance work, CBOs should be helping to  support your school’s instructional focus.

Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following:  1.   Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and  together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will  lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming.

Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   The Community School Director will be based in house to support the school on an ongoing basis. Along with the  School Supervisor (A. P.) he will ensure that all programs run effectively and efficiently. He will ensure that the  students numbers are on target with the number for the target goal and recruit students if enrollment falls below  targeted goal. The community Director will ensure that the Data staff member keeps track of all enrolled students  and that attendance is monitored, taken and entered into Youth- Net Services regularly.

Based on classroom assessments, and the NYSESLAT results we have from 2017-2018 we have  concluded that a large number of our ELLs need small instruction to enhance their reading  comprehension and vocabulary. Our program is designed to address these needs.  Our Title III Program will be offered once a week as an after-school program. I t will run from  November to February and it be facilitated by ESL and Bilingual teachers.  Teachers will develop thematic units that will allow children to explore content vocabulary and  scientific concepts in a fun and engaging environment. Teachers will employ Vocabulary  Workshop and Write Time for Kids. Vocabulary Workshop offers an interactive online  component that can be used for small group or whole group instruction; and Write Time for Kids  enhances reading comprehension as well a writing skills and grammar. Both programs provided  scaffold for reading and writing. Data will be gathered through formative assessments (exit slips,  paragraph writing, group presentations) and summative assessments (performance tasks,  quizzes). Data will guide follow up lessons and activities. For Children who are at  entering and  emerging levels the program will develop and strengthen phonemic awareness and phonic skills  through the use of Fundations Reading Program.  In addition we will offer ENL for adults. This portion of our program is geared to equip parents  with basic oral, reading, and writing skills. The materials used for this segment are Grammar  Workshop and carefully selected passages. The objective of this segment is to build a home and  parent connection by including parents in our academic goals and planning. Also by ELL parents  with basic reading, wiring, and oral communication skills we believe they will be better equipped  to help their children achieve their academic goals.  The overall goal of our program is to strengthen reading fluency, comprehension, and vocabulary  of our target population in order to achieve proficiency in the NYSESLAT, and New York  Standardized Assessments.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             In order to accelerate the academic literacy achievement of our ELLs in the classroom teachers  and administrators will attend a series of workshops through through the Office of English  language Learners at no cost to Title III funds.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The formative assessment tools our school uses to guide instructional planning for ELLs is as follows:  Pre and Post Reading assessments  Mathematics Assessment Measure of Student Learning (MOSL),  New York State Alternative Assessment (NYSAA)  Grade 3 Baseline Assessments  Periodic Assessments for Reading and Math to evaluate reading fluency.  Response to Intervention (RTI) includes assessment components for ELLs and utilize teacher-created assessments for reading,  spelling, vocabulary in context, the use of reading inventories, student running records,  Fryword daily assessments,  Fundations of Reading, K-1  NYSITELL and NYSESLAT.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      Fauntas and Pinnell assessment, administered to students three times throughout the school year  Teacher-student observations using exit tickets, response to questions, and lesson follow-up   These formative assessments will help guide instruction by:  Providing teachers with progress monitoring for reading fluency,  Determine levels of phonemic and phonics awareness,  Teaching and reteaching of basic sight words and comprehension  Assist with grouping, planning, and delivery instruction to differentiate instruction  Address specific core content including mathematics concepts and application as well as science and social studies.  Improve intensive, strategic and benchmark levels  Provide vital information to help ELLs improve their academic instructional plan        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We have put into place the following structure:  Teachers participate in cabinet meetings, and grade meetings during common preparation periods to design intervention plans  and examine why the student is not progressing academically.  Teachers review, analyze, and discuss teaching strategies and overall lesson plans. Both the classroom teachers and ELL  teachers meet to organize and itemize data into the school’s “Dropbox” which is one of the tools teachers use to keep track of  students data and progress. Once the information is inputted into “Dropbox” it will automatically analyze the student’s data  giving teachers a clear picture of each students performance. Classroom teachers who are on the same grade use the Dropbox.  They retrieve and share data that is in turn used to compare assessment results.  Teachers review exams and quizzes given to students, projects, and student’s sample classwork and apply rubrics. They reflect  on teaching skills or reteaching a particular lesson. They use information gathered to differentiate lessons for students, and to  help guide and drive instruction through flexible grouping.        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We use the following baseline/benchmark assessments to identify progress and areas of need:  Students complete mid/end of unit tests, performance tasks in Ready Gen and Expeditionary Learning  Periodic assessments in ELA  NYSESLAT to assess English proficiency level  Students complete Go Math, pre and posttest, mid unit, end of unit reviews,  NYS Science inquiry based assessments  Social Studies performance task, presentations, exit projects  Produce writing pieces to reflect different genres in writing such as memoirs, argumentative/opinion essays, persuasive  writing, report of informational text  Performance tasks, end of unit vocabulary tests, weekly, monthly grammar/spelling tests.  Continuous embedded assessments from Imagine Learning technology program for ELLs.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data is gathered, our ELL teachers in collaboration with classroom teachers meet with students and  parents on Tuesdays during parent engagement afternoon from 2:20-3:30 pm to:  Discuss student progress and assessment results and pinpoint areas of strength and development  Provide feedback and recommendations to parents in the literacy programs.  ELL teachers in collaboration with classroom teachers meet on common prep periods to analyze and focus on student’s work  using Common Core Learning Standards looking for trends in students work. Then they devise strategies to address student  notable errors, and come up with an action plan of intervention to adapt lessons and support student in the targeted areas.  ELLs participate in:  The Reading Rescue Intervention program that afford small groups and individual students the opportunity to practice and  excel in reading fluency, phonics, comprehension, word attack skills, and spelling. Teachers keep a running record, student log,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         portfolios, and student performance task.  Tiered instruction (grouping based on student’s needs) to address areas that student’s struggle with.  Hands-on activities that support the weekly skills taught.  Teacher/student conferences to provide students with positive feedback, intervention strategies, encouragement, and  ownership that impact direct instruction.  Technology programs such as: Imagine Learning, Starfall, and Myon.  Additional support is given to students in Title III programs (Early Bird program, ELL into Action, and Immigrant program).        5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   As outlined in page 65 of the updated ELL Policy Reference Guide, March 2017, support services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) in our  school is as follows:  The classroom teachers in collaboration with the ENL Coordinator, Literacy coach, RTI and AIS support service providers  analyze the K-5 data to guide instruction. ELLs who perform below levels on periodic and annual ELL English proficiency  assessments are considered for additional support services. For example, Transitioning ELLs they receive additional support in  ELA and Mathematics. We offer Midwinter, Spring Academy, and Saturday Academy, and the 21St Century Extended day  programs.  We carefully examine and take into consideration ELLs years of instruction in the ENL program, English and home language  literacy, ELL subgroups such as SIFE, and Long-term ELLs, teacher recommendation based on student class work, and parents  request during teacher/parent conference meetings.  We provide SIFE with content area and socio emotional support by allowing teacher/student questions and answer sessions,  completion of a student reflective journal and reaching out to parents in order to support the needs of students. The teachers  plan grade-level appropriate differentiated instruction and strategies that are aligned to Common Core State Standards (CCSS)  and use ELL methodology in all four language modalities (listening, speaking, reading and writing).  Students in K-5 receive intensive tailored instruction outside the 90 minutes reading block as part of the RTI model. Instruction  for ELLs in English language development is provided at the Tier 1instructional level. If the students demonstrate a need for  more intensive academic support then they are moved into Tier 2 and 3. Students who test out from the ELL program scoring  commanding level of language proficiency or who have met NY State exam requirements in ELA/Math are given additional  support for 2 years of 90 minutes instructional alloted time and test accomodations.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We use the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT results and RLAT modalities reports from ATS. We closely examine areas of need and plan our  instruction in speaking, listening, reading, and writing.  We look to see how many students are moving across language  proficiency (Entering to Transitioning) and look at how well students performed in state exams and periodic assessments in  (ELA, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies), and MOSL outcomes and teacher input during inquiry meetings.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   ATS reports are used to explain the results according to language levels and modalities. We use classroom teacher input and  share information to plan instruction according to the results and recommendations. Data is shared among teachers through  Dropbox, teacher team meetings. Teachers meet with students to share student progress twice a month. They adapt lessons  for students and address their individual needs. Parents are informed and encouraged to attend parent/teacher conferences  to discuss student progress.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Based on the revised and amended requirements for English Language Learners (ELLs) as per CR Part 154.2 and 154.3  2015-2016 school year, our (K-8) school delivers and implements English instruction for ELLs in the following way:  Elementary (K-5)- ELLs receive freestanding English as a new language instruction by a certified ENL teacher. ENL  instruction is delivered through both Standalone and Integrated instructional organizational model as outlined in CR  Part154 requirements for ENL. ELLs receive Integrated ENL by 2 individually certified teachers using a co-teaching  model in the content area ofELA/Math to develop English acquisition through focused instruction in the core content  courses. The (K-5) ENL teacher offers language content and vocabulary support through the content area: ELA,  Mathematics, Social studies, and Science, in alignment with common core, and home language support.The ENL  teacher works collaboratively with general education classroom teachers on student scheduling and programming  them into Stars Classroom. Students are homogenously grouped (language proficiency level is the same in one class).  The ENL teacher provides instruction and groups ELLs according to language proficiency levels. Lessons include  listening, speaking, reading, and writing strategies and are aligned with supplemental material.  Our Middle School grades (6-8) is usually departmentalized. ENL instruction is delivered through both Standalone and  Integrated instructional organizational model as outlined in CR Part154 requirements for ENL.   ELLs receive  Integrated ENL by 2 individually certified teachers using a co-teaching model in the content area of  ELA/Math to  develop English acquisition through focused instruction in the core content courses. Students at mixed proficiency  levels are programmed into Stars Classroom in collaboration with the classroom teachers. The content area classroom  teachers for ELA/Math collaborate and plan for curricular alignment and instruction improvement, and to work on  student's learning program and schedules. ENL lessons are thematic in nature and include strategies in listening,  speaking, reading and writing and are aligned with supplemental material. Graphic organizers and the use of  computer programs are used to introduce and to tie-in each lesson unit. The program enhances students home  language skills through the use of dictionaries, glossaries,  provide native language support through newly purchased  translated chapter books, texts, and by pairing ELLs with English dominant peers that serve as language models   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Currently our school does not have a bilingual program, however we have a certified bilingual math teacher in our  middle school offering math in Spanish/English to our Spanish-speaking students. Our ENL teacher meets with the  math teacher to plan for instruction, to ensure curricular alignment, and continuity of instruction. During ELA lesson,  ELLs use translated versions of the assigned classroom chapter books in the home language as a guide and support for  instruction. The math teacher provides both English and native language support to students. The teacher uses  glossaries, and native-language teacher-made materials, groups spanish-speaking students for certain activities, and  provide mathematical content and concepts clarification for struggling ELLs in Spanish as needed during the lessons.  These students also participate in our afterschool Title III programs that offer academic vocabulary enrichment,  ELA/Math support. We adhere to NYS CR Part 154, as amended by the Aspira Consent Decree, to open a bilingual  program when there are 15 or more ELL students in grades K to 8 that speak the same language in one or two  contiguous grades.    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Currently, we do not have a dual language program at our school. We plan to survey and inform parents of a dual  language program. Our teachers, parents and staff will need further professional development opportunities to  explore this option for the students.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      P.S./ I.S. 155 ELLs ensures that students are receiving the mandated number of instructional minutes provided according to the  new 2015-2016 Part 154-2 (K-8) English As a New Language ENL Units of study and staffing requirements. Our teachers are  given a schedule to display in their respective classrooms and students are asked to keep a program card in their notebooks as  a reminder.  Delivery of instruction follows a Stand-Alone/Integrated ENL type for both Elementary (K to 5) and Middle School  (6-8).     ENL teachers partner with content area teachers for the delivery of instruction. The ENL teacher co-teaches together with the  content area teacher. The content is generally taught through a whole/small/whole lesson format using a specific co-teaching  model. During the lesson, the ENL teacher works with small groups of ELLs to teach much needed language objectives in  multiple entry points, and differentiate instruction tailored to each students proficiency level. Usually, the ENL teacher teaches  the ELLs much needed vocabulary and concepts through visuals, TPR, gestures, graphic organizers to construct meaning, story  elements, sentence frames, and the use of electronic devices used for translation. The home language is supported through  translated materials, dictionaries, leveled libraries, glossaries, language based computer programs in both English and the  home language, teacher-made worksheets as a scaffold for home language support.     Everyday, students are instructed according to their grade level and given the mandated time (Entering/Emerging 360 minutes  of instruction and Transitioning and Expanding 180 minutes as outlined per CR Part 154 requirements for ENL. Students  are  taught in English. The Integrated ENL model consists of two individually certified teachers co-teaching. The ENL teacher  works in collaboration with the certified content area teacher. Both teachers plan together lessons and keep track of student  portfolios and discuss academic progress. Students with mixed proficiency levels form part of the regular classroom instruction  and participate in small group activities where the ENL teacher uses to support student's language development and academic  progress. Depending on the students language needs and proficiency, students are taught ELA and Math according to their  mandated instructional units of study throughout the day. For both elementary and middle school, the teachers work with  entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding and commanding linguistic levels. At the entering, emerging, and transitioning  levels students learn basic academic vocabulary and communication skills and fundamentals so they can be ready to develop  socially and linguistically. Across the proficiency levels including the expanding and commanding levels students focus on the  English Language Arts, the four language modalities, and content area.  The students prepare to take the NYSESLAT through a  variety of test sophistication material. Our ELLs are provided with the following mandated units of study: ELLs at the  entering(beginning level) and the emerging (low intermediate level) each receive two units of study that is equivalent to 360  minutes of instruction and home language support. ELLs at the transitioning(intermediate level) and the expanding (advanced  level) each receive one unit that is equivalent to 180 minutes of instruction and home language support. Former ELLs that exit  the program at the commanding (proficient level) or if student passed based on the new expanding criteria having met  requirements in ELA exams with 3+ or 4 are given an additional two year minimum number of units of integrated ENL support  (90 minutes instruction per week) including all test accommodations and school supplemental ELL program.  Additionally, All  ELLs are taken to our literacy center for an additional 45 minute period on Fridays for vocabulary development, phonemic  awareness, and listening skills. All ENL lessons are aligned with the curriculum and are structured to teach academic  vocabulary, grammar, and expression. Our teachers plan for instruction during common preparation periods and devote time  to meet with each other to discuss student progress at faculty meetings and share expertise at professional development  opportunities.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Core content is delivered through the use of various methodologies such as: Total Physical Response (TPR), Depth of  Knowledge questioning technique (DOK), read aloud, Language Experience Approach, KWL reading strategies, visuals,  audiovisuals, the use of graphic organizers, and specific activities to develop the four language modalities.   ELLs participate in After school and Saturday programs that provide targeted instruction, NYSESLAT preparation, and academic  achievement standards in the second language.Students receive small group and individualized instruction for the purpose of  identifying, developing and strengthening literacy, math, science, social studies, and language skills.  The teachers use NYS-ENL Standards, instructional strategies and alignment to Core Depth of Knowledge (DOK) curriculum,  Balanced Literacy.All instruction will also comply with CR Part 154-2 regulations. Classes use Elements of Reading Vocabulary   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      (Harcourt Achieve) A-D levels, Sadlier Phonics A-D levels, and Moving Into English as their reading program.This research- based reading program is designed to support students as they become proficient readers in English. It uses systematic,  explicit reading instruction to develop the skills needed to become a proficient reader.  These skills include phonemic  awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary development and text comprehension.   Trade books, Dual language classroom Libraries and a Spanish manipulative picture kit completes the literacy program and  continues to address and enhance the teaching and learning of native language arts.All classes have native language literature  libraries and dictionaries for their students.Additional funding through Title III will be used to purchase supplementary  materials.Content area such as Science, Social Studies and Mathematics are taught and appropriate related materials are  purchased. Instructional materials support the learning of our ELL population.We have dual language libraries, Moving Into  English, My0n, Imagine Learning English, Balanced Literacy program as the reading program, Santillana Intensive English  program (1999) used to elicit language development and develop cognitive academic vocabulary, Spanish/English dictionaries,  picture dictionaries, bilingual glossaries, thesaurus: Synonyms and antonyms, encyclopedia, word walls charts, Attanasio &  Associates NYSESLAT preparation booklets K-8, big books, and audio cassette libraries.  All teachers attend in-house professional development opportunities every Monday from 2:20-3:45pm in order to better serve  our ELL population.Some activities used by classroom teachers are role playing, KWL charts, guided reading, read aloud, hot  topic discussions, graphic organizer, and visuals whenever possible.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Our ELLs take the translated versions of content area exams in Mathematics and Science and are allowed to use glossaries to  prepare for exams, and during exams ELLs are given word-to-word dictionaries.  Students also use dual language libraries,  chapter books, and engage in accountable talk in the home language on cultural topics and everyday situations and  experiences.  We offer home language support  through pairing students of various language proficiencies to support each  other in the home language and English. We use bilingual staff who speak Hatian-Creole, French, Spanish, and Arabic to help  clarify to students and classroom teachers specific lesson concepts and content when needed     5.

Instructional plan for SIFE: We continue to identify and service SIFE students as mentioned in the CRPart 154-2 amended  requirements 2015-16. Our plan for students with inconsistent/interrupted formal education (SIFE) begins with the  identification and screening of students who enter as new entrants to the NYC Public School System (code 58’s) with a HILS  OTELE (Other than English) and a complete review of the Spanish LAB, NYSITELL and the Home Language Survey (HLIS).   We  identify students who are at least two years below expected grade level in literacy in their home language and are two or more  years below grade level in mathematics due to inconsistent or interrupted education prior to arriving into the United  States.  Much feedback is received from oral interviews, the classroom teacher and parent.   b. Instructional plan for Newcomers: Our plan for Newcomers who are not only newly arrived ELLs and who enrolled in United  States schools for less than 3 years, but may also be students who are born in the United States and are at emerging,  transitioning, or higher levels of language acquisition will continue to receive ENL services in small class size for optimum  academic performance. Students learn to interact, share experiences without peer pressure, and teachers can plan to meet  students’ individual needs. The transitional plan will help students increase language development through technology and  small group instruction. We try to make the learning environment as pleasant and comfortable as possible by assigning  another classmate whenever possible who speaks their native language to assist in the transition process.  The student who  are new to the country develop basic skills and the necessary language to cope with daily social and academic demands.  ELA  test practice and daily test sophistication is used to prepare student readiness to meet NYS standards.  c. Our plan for developing ELLs (4 to 6 years) is also to place them in small class size for optimum academic performance.  Students and teachers plan together long and short-term goals to meet individual needs. Increase and continue language  development through technology and individualized instruction.  ELA test practice and daily test sophistication is used to  prepare students to meet NYS standards.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      1) The ENL teacher will provide additional support to ELLs in our Early Bird morning ELL reading/Math program given Mondays,  Tuesdays, and Wednesday from 7:30 am -8:00 am.  Students will have an opportunity to read and write across the curriculum  in a variety of genres, biographies, books about science and history, art and music, etc.  Students will be engaged in literacy  through dramatic activities such as stories in the form of plays. The ENL teacher will utilize Building Fluency through Reader’s  Theater, High Interest literacy chapter books, and Moving Into English.   2) The ENL teacher will conduct literature circles during reading.  Students will have opportunities to engage in accountable  talk, discussions, and character analysis.  Parents will be given opportunities to listen to their child read to them during school  events such as special literacy assemblies, Poetry Day, audio and video recordings, and school newsletters, etc.   3) The ENL teacher will meet with classroom teachers to discuss individual student progress and student class work every  Tuesday and have daily feedback during common preparation periods throughout the day. 4) Students will have opportunities  to read for fluency and comprehension in four voices, small groups, silently, orally and choral.  d. Our plan for long term ELLs ( 7or more years) is to involve them in Academic Intervention Services (AIS), Saturday programs,  Midwinter and Spring Academies, test sophistication sessions, counseling services, peer study groups, Title III After School  Programs, and After School programs offered by 21 Century Academy.  Daily journal writing and teacher directed writing  projects that will be included into the classroom instruction.  We will offer testing modifications, extended time, small  grouping, and class setting conducive to learning.    e. Our plan for former ELLs (up to 2 years after exiting ELL status) is as follows:  We plan to provide additional support in  content area English Language Arts, Social Studies, Science, and Mathematics through our extended-day programs; one-to-one  tutoring sessions during our 90 minutes per week instructional support given on Fridays at our literacy center, Response to  Intervention, RTI services during the schools instructional time set aside for vocabulary practice that is scheduled by classroom  teachers and clusters throughout the day. Students will receive test accommodations during NYS exams. Students will have  access to bilingual glossaries, bilingual libraries, additional Science-Lab hours, laptops and internet access for research and can  participate in our 21 Century Homework Assistance program that is open to all students.  Additionally, students will be  included in field trips, assemblies, and extracurricular activities and school based parent/teacher community activities.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELL and of Students with Disabilities, (SWDs) deliver 90 minute block periods of  Literacy and Mathematics daily.  MyOn is used as a comprehensive Content Area reading technology program.  Our plan for ELLs with special needs is to  increase high frequency vocabulary, the implementation of Fundations reading program, use more lesson adaptations such as  smart boards, visuals, big books, and technology such as Imagine Learning English, Passport Journeys II, Starfall, and one to one  instruction to enrich language lessons. Students participate in guided reading instruction using the Wilson Program and  Elements of Reading Vocabulary to introduce and reinforce vocabulary, phonics, phonemic awareness, syllabication, and  sentence building that provide students access to academic core-content areas and accelerate English language development.  Continue test sophistication and much needed one-to-one practice, differentiated instruction.  Our plans for ELL students with disabilities whose IEP recommend ENL/Bilingual instruction is as follows:   1) The ELA/ENL teacher will give students more time to complete class work, model the writing process through scaffolding  and building sentence structures.  Through the use of creative art allow students to read engaging passages and then discuss  the setting, characters, problems and solutions in a given story.  2) The ENL teacher will guide students in the creative writing process.  Students will write across the curriculum and will utilize  Common Core-Aligned Tasks with instructional support-Teacher College Reading and Writing Project, (TCRWP), glossaries,  picture dictionaries and the internet to develop story narratives, biographies, and stories in the form of plays.  The students  will use Building Fluency through Reader’s Theater, High Interest literacy chapter books, and Moving Into English to further  develop literacy.  3) The ESL/ENL teacher will meet with classroom teachers to discuss individual student progress and student class work every  Tuesday from 2:20-3:10, and have daily feedback during common preparation periods throughout the day.  4) Students will participate in rigorous Academic Intervention services (AIS), After School, Wednesday and Thursdays using  differentiated small group instruction and tutorial program through Global Partnership, 21St Century S.E.S providers.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  PS/IS 155 is committed to providing curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of  ELLs-SWDs  to achieve IEP goals and attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment. We adhere to the revised K-8,  2015-16 CR Part 154 requirements for English as a New Language.  Our ELLs are placed in a General Education classes according to grade level. SWDs are placed in their classes according to their  Individualized Educational Plan, (IEP). The assigned classroom teachers keep ELLs for the day. Cluster Content Area teachers  visit the classroom and provide instruction after the 90 minute block periods.  360 minutes instructional time is devoted to ENL for students in the Entering and Emerging levels.Both Entering and Emerging  ELLs receive180 minutes of Integrated instruction. Entering ELLs receive 180 minutes Standalone. Emerging ELLs receive 90  minutes Standalone and 90 minutes Flexibility in any other content area.  Transitioning ELLs receive 90 minutes Integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes Flexibility with ELA or any other content area for a  total of 180 minutes instructional time. Expanding ELLs receive a full 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.  Commanding ELLs receive 90 minutes Integrated ENL/ELA or other content area for two years support.  ELLs are scheduled into Stars Classroom for ENL classes according to language proficiency levels in the subject areas of ELA,  Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies. They are programmed by grades and grouped together in the same classrooms in  order to facilitate ENL scheduling and programming mandated allotted time. This model facilitates grouping for instruction in  both General and the least restrictive environment, and allows few interruptions to students' daily academic schedule.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our ELL population come from different native-language backgrounds such as: Haitian, French, and Arabic, and from different  socioeconomic levels and experiences.  10 ELLs in our school are SIFE and have interrupted formal education.   In instead of a  simplified curriculum for ELLs, our targeted intervention program for ELLs in ELA, Math, and other content area include high  rigor and support result in higher achievement for ELLs. For reading, we use the ReadyGen and Expeditionary programs,  Elements of Reading Vocabulary, Sadlier Phonics with emphasis in phonics and vocabulary, and comprehension development.   We will continue to use the Wilson Foundations program three times per week to develop core vocabulary and fluency during  the school's 90 minute literacy block.  For Math, we use Go Math and MPC3 components with emphasis in subject related vocabulary development.Students learn to  use manipulatives, charts, and graphs in each lesson. Students in expanding level are grouped to work collaboratively in  specific skills with other students.  For Science and Social Studies student concentrate in developing more sophisticated vocabulary through the use of picture  analysis and the Voyager Passport Journey II program. Students have daily scheduled visits to our state-of-the-art Science  Laboratory and are exposed to hands-on experiential activities, research and the scientific method.Students prepare written  projects and oral presentations for language understanding and fluency.Test sophistication material and leveled libraries are  used to prepare for NYS Content Area Science and Social Studies examinations in the content area.  ELLs will be supported through scaffolding techniques in the classroom.Students will participate in learning tasks through  thematic instruction and guided direct instruction through common core lessons. We will target students in specific language  groups such as the ones mentioned above.We plan to pay special attention and target SIFE students who are below grade level  and are in the tested grades (3-8).SIFE students who enter the school system in grades K-2 will receive additional support and  will participate in our extended day and extra curricular activities.  The ENL teacher will monitor progress through porfolio evaluation and lesson outcome.Additionally, we will provide  instructional support to low performing, struggling ELLs in reading, writing, and ELLs in Special Needs classes.Our students will  continue to participate in more rigorous yet consistent plan for instruction in English to develop language proficiency in order  to deliver new aligned common core lessons and grade-appropriate subject matter to ELLs.  We plan to provide literacy, Mathematics, and core-content area: Social Studies, Science instruction to all students. Students  who scored Level 1 will receive additional support in literacy and mathematics during our extended-day program on  Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:20-3:10 pm. , and students who scored a level 2 in ELA and Mathematics will be supported  during Response to Intervention program (RTI) which is offered to students one period twice a week by classroom teachers.  Additionally, students will receive support during the 90 minutes Literacy Block. Out of classroom teachers will also work with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      selected students throughout the week during their administrative periods.  We also offer the following targeted intervention programs for ELLs: Title III Early-Bird program that is offered on Thursdays  and Fridays from 7:00 am to 8:00 am. The subgroups targeted are our entering and emerging beginners and our transitional  Intermediate level ELLs. Also, students participate in our ELL Into Action program that is offered on Wednesdays- Fridays from  2:20-4:20 pm. for all ELLs including ELLs who passed the NYSESLAT and continue to receive 2 year literacy support and test  accommodations.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on data and trends, the improvements considered for the upcoming school year includes: more teacher professional  development for both Content Area classroom teachers and ENL teachers on co-teaching models, lesson alignment with the  Common Core Learning Standards, more use of technology based lessons through the use of Smart Boards, and laptops.  We plan to expand our library to include more literacy dual language books in languages such as Haitian-Creole, French, and  Arabic. We plan to use more grade-level, age appropriate anchor chapter books and high interest content area material as  scaffold for newcomers and SIFE students.We plan to improve our existing program by providing additional support to ELLs in  Mathematics and Science.  Students will be exposed and manipulate state-of-the-art science material in our Science Lab.  ELLs will continue to be exposed  to new technology such as smart boards and DVD leveled libraries while continuing to include field trips, hands-on learning  experiences, and other related activities. The program will include further collaboration and participation of parents and  teachers     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Due to a shift in the school’s population and demographics shows an insufficient number of ELLs registered in two contiguous  grades of the same language to make up a bilingual class. Parent’s Choice Survey indicates parents prefer their child in an ENL  program     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs at our school.  Parents are sent notices to inform them of the academic  programs being offered After-School. We offer the After-School Title III  ELL into Action program, Early-Bird Title III program,  Response to Intervention (RTI)program to all students upon parent request, and student interests.  Students are offered  weekly a two-day Extended-Day 50 minutes of intensive instruction in ELA, Math, and test sophistication skills.  We plan to continue using all instructional programs in school in order to reach all children of diverse cultural, and linguistic  backgrounds.  Our ELLs have equal access to all school instructional academic programs, including Reading lab, After-school  programs, Leadership program, ELL parent and community resources, Saturday Academy, and the 21st Century extracurricular  activities that is open to all students. Additionally, the academic intervention program: ELL Into Action, and our Saturday  Academy serve as a continuing transitional support, and (2 year) for ELLs reaching proficiency.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The instructional materials used to support ELLs are as follows: Moving Into English for K-8, Ready Gen K-2 Published by  Pearson, Expeditionary 3-8, Buckle Down, to the Common Core State Standards, Elements of Reading, Sadlier Phonics,  Grammar Usage and Mechanics levels 1-5 by Time For Kids, Progress Coach (English Language Arts and Mathematics K-4),  Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT and Beyond by Attansio and Associates, Comprehension Series, Developing Fiction and  Nonfiction Skills by Teacher Created Materials Publishing.  ELLs native language is supported through small group instruction utilizing trade books, chapter books, and content area  material, internet web based sites such as: www.spanish flashcard.com, aaamath.com, etc… Classroom teachers use  dictionaries, bilingual glossaries, Ready Gen and Expediationary ELL components, as well as books in the content area to  support native language instruction.  All classrooms are equipped with leveled libraries, and resources that correspond to ELLs culture, age and grade levels.We use  Voyager Passport and Moving Into English for ELA instruction that has individual reading packs to improve student's vocabulary  and fluency.Open Court (phonics wall card),Reader’s Theatre are used as supplementary instructional material.The students  also participate in Imagine Learning English K-8 technology program for differentiated instruction.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      The program helps develop and strengthen student vocabulary, phonics, listening/speaking, as well as reading  comprehension.Students use Elements of Vocabulary and Grammar Usage and Mechanics as a component to the  Reading/Writing workshop. ELL lessons are supplemented through the use of websites such as: www.starfall.com,  www.usingenglish.com, aaamath.com, www.biography.com, storylineonline.net, and www.spanishflashcard.com to support  home language instruction.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In our ENL program model, home language support is delivered through the use of dual language Spanish leveled libraries in a  variety of genres.  We use cultural informational DVDs and computer internet virtual-tours to teach students about their  culture, music, and heritage.  ELLs lessons include the teaching of cognates, high frequency words, dolch wordlist,  to foster  better comprehension skills in the native language,  glossaries and word-to-word dictionaries are used to clarify meanings and  to understand mathematical terms and concepts.  Students are afforded time to share and interact in small groups to discuss their interests in particular topics. ELL classrooms  include newspapers, magazines, sets of audio-leveled books to read and do research.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The new reading programs such as Ready Gen for K-2 and Expeditionary 3-8 are aligned with the New York State Common- Core Learning Standards.   In both reading programs students advance through oral, written, and listening skills. The reading program utilizes and  includes performance based assessments in narrative, expository, informational texts, text based vocabulary, words in context,  , anchor texts, supporting texts, and a scaffolded instruction for English Language Learners in the areas of writing, decoding,  clarifying details, and strategic support for struggling ELLs in order to monitor their progress.  Expeditionary program builds background knowledge through guided question techniques, reading-literature, informational  texts, writing to explain: drafting strong paragraph and English language modules. All lessons include suggestions, and use of  graphic organizers as scaffold that can be used by learners with lower levels of language proficiency and/or learning. The rich,  complex reading programs mentioned above are being implemented to all students, including the ELLs. The program features  challenging but interesting selections, and rigorous motivating activities and resources that correspond to ELL age and grade  levels.  All classrooms are equipped with leveled libraries, and resources that correspond to ELLs culture, age and grade levels.Our ENL  teachers use the supplemental material embedded in the teacher's guides to expand and review concepts taught by classroom  teachers.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Presently, our school does not share a building (collocation), however if in the future our school building is shared, we will  coordinate efforts with the other school personnel within our building. We will connect and collaborate and with all  administration, reading coach, guidance counselors, school leadership team, ELL coordinators, parent coordinators, and  community organizations to plan and share best teaching practices and strategies to ensure that all ELLs’ academic, linguistic,  and socio-emotional needs are met.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   All ELLs have equal access to all school instructional academic programs, including Reading lab, Title III After-School program,  Early-Bird Title III program, Leadership program, ELL parent and community resources, Saturday Academy, and the 21st  Century extracurricular activities that include track and field, chorus, dance, soccer/flag football, martial arts, drumming, and  basketball that is open to all students.    All ELLs including newly enrolled ELLs participate and are exposed to the school's extracurricular activities such as assemblies,  class field trips to parks, museums, and colleges, To further assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year,  parents are given an informational packet to familiarize them with the school programs, student schedule, school rules and  regulations, resources and to review goals for the school year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65         Parents meet with school officials such as the principal, school secretary, parent coordinator, and PTA president to receive a  general orientation about school protocols.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Currently we do not offer language electives, but we plan to have two teachers provide instruction to middle school students  in Spanish and French as a foreign language.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Currently, we do not have a dual language program in our school, however in the future with additional  support and funding, and with parents consent we could try a pilot program with one Kindergarten class.        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  We are committed to offering ongoing Professional Development to all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic staff. The following  school staff is included in our Professional development plan:  ENL Teachers, paraprofessionals  Bilingual guidance counselor, bilingual Social worker, bilingual psychologist, bilingual occupational therapist, family workers,  parent coordinator  Department of Education: Single Shepherd support team (social worker and guidance counselor)  Bridge the Gap Service provider    Professional Development Opportunities being offered:  All teachers, and non-pedagogic attend weekly professional development series from the Center for Integrated Teacher  Instruction, CITE every Monday from 2:20- 3:45 pm.

Participants discuss issues regarding Bilingual/ENL and specific student needs.    ELL personnel and content area teachers participate in various ELL related activities and discussions described below as part of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         our District initiatives and professional development opportunities on a monthly basis. Role playing, guided reading, read  aloud, ELL policy, graphic organizer, KWL charts and visuals new Co-teaching models, trends, lesson planning, classroom  techniques, and ENL strategies  ENL teachers, content area classroom teachers, paraprofessionals, and non-pedagogic staff meet grade leaders and  administrators every Wednesday from 2:20- 3:10 p.m. during common preparation periods for teacher inquiry teams. They  address the specific needs of ELLs and ensure ELLs' needs are taken into consideration in lesson planning, projects, and school  initiatives.Recommendations are given that consequently lead to new topics for staff development in the content area:  Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies. Teacher select students for mentoring and provide intervention where needed  based on class work, homework, written and oral projects.    ELL teachers and other non-pedagogic staff participate in the annual NYSABE Professional Development seminars, which also  afford teachers the opportunity to learn about how to further help ELLs.  ELL teachers and classroom teachers participate in professional development opportunities from the Office of Brooklyn North  located at131 Livingston Street. Dates and time are announced via email.    ELL teachers and classroom teachers attend conferences offered throughout the school year at the Instituto Cervantes  endorsed by the Spanish Government in New York. Conference includes meeting published authors, best teaching practices,  and home language Spanish support through interdisciplinary approaches (Literacy, Art, History)      Our ENL teachers, SETTS teacher, and Coach attend Response to Intervention (RTI) Institute, and ELL Institute Cohort Seminars.  Participants receive new up-to-date information regarding Bilingual/ENL best practices, policies and regulations and how to  work with RTI students. Teachers meet during common preps to discuss, plan activities, review data, plan field trips, meet with  Principal and prepare lessons.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As per CR Part 154.2, outlined in the updated March 2017 ELL policy and Reference Guide, PS/IS 155 will provide required  Professional Development to all teachers and administrators working with ELLs through our borough Field Support Center and  School professional development.  A minimum of 15% of required hours as per CR Part 80 will be dedicated to language  development, content instruction for ELLs, and best practices in the co-teaching models. ENL and bilingual teachers will receive  a minimum of 50% required hours of professional development that will be dedicated to language acquisition in alignment  with core content area instruction, best co-teaching practices, and content instruction. ELL/LAP team members in  collaboration with the Assistant Principal will review, update, and maintain training records for participants. They will keep  records in school file, log teacher attendance of hours of participation, and share much needed linguistic activities across the  grade levels.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our school hosts open-house, family night, and open school afternoons/evenings parent/teacher conferences held 4 times  throughout the school year to provide parents with feedback regarding student academic progress. Most parents are reached  and informed via school letters, invitations, and school newsletters. At meeting parents discuss key questions from school  agenda, and sign an attendance sheet. During annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs teachers discuss the goals of the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67            program, their language growth, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in the core  content.  We meet parents every Tuesday from 2:20 pm to 3:35 pm to discuss individual students progress and parent  concerns. We adhere to the Office of Field support for our district, and DOE  guidelines. During these meetings, parents are  afforded language interpretation and translation as needed in the home language offered by  staff members who speak the  language and services rendered by the Translation and Interpretation Unit.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parental Involvement Activities are as follows:  We provide specific activities throughout the course of the the school year for parents of ELLs. Professional development is  offered once a month in the afternoon to discuss topics of interest and needs. Parents meet with ELL staff to discuss student  progress at parent-teacher conferences.  PTA and our Parent Coordinator reaches parents by phone or mail to inform them of upcoming school events, exam schedule,  and up to date information on the chancellor’s regulations and policy.  As members of the school leadership team, parents become involved in their children’s education and learn new ways to help  their children succeed academically. Specific ELL students needing help are addressed at the meetings and parents’ input is  seriously acknowledged.  The school partners with the School Leadership program agency and community based organization such as the 21st Century  Extracurricular Program.Our PTA provide interesting workshops and community services to ELL parents as well. We evaluate  the needs of parents through parent surveys provided in the language of the parent.  Translation services are provided to parents through our bilingual staff including our Parent Coordinator Mrs. Maria  Pimentel.Our Parent Coordinator will also be consulted as to the needs of PS/IS 155 and for translations. Our Parent-Teacher  Association, in collaboration with both General and Special Education teachers, will maintain an open communication and  have input into this process.  A school-wide survey is also be sent home with the students as a needs assessment. After careful review of the parent surveys,  we contact and match parents with the appropriate agencies that can further assist and guide them regarding their specific  needs.Additionally, translation and interpretation support is given to parents in the following languages: Spanish, French, and  Hatian Creole during Open- School teacher-Parent conferences.Parent Orientations, assemblies, and Parent workshops are  often addressed in Spanish by: Bilingual/ENL teachers/ENL Coordinator.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Nicholas-Herkimer Elementary                                                                              School DBN: 23K155  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of a school emergency we will follow the school’s general response protocol. Parents are informed  throughout the school year on what to do in the event of an emergency. A translated letter is sent to parents outlining  to them the use of an Alert card used as part of our school’s emergency plan. The card includes what to do in case of  an emergency and shows the color symbols used to indicate emergencies such as: green to evacuate, red Soft/Hard  lockdown, yellow Shelter-In. We reach limited-English–proficient families by using language assistance services from  bilingual personnel, bilingual Building Response Team (BRT) members, and school security. Information is circulated  through the use of body language, pointing to signs and location, word-of-mouth, and through alert signs and symbols  displayed throughout the school. ATS Roster, Emergency “Blue-Cards”, or the day’s ATS absent report will be used to  contact parents. Teachers will be directed to have in their possession a record of class’ attendance including parent’s  telephone numbers with them should they need to exit the building and/or provide additional information and  instruction to parents.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76         Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663  and what resources are available to meet compliance.      PS/IS 155 will review on a regular basis the school's language assistance needs in order to fulfill Section VII of the  Chancellor's Regulation A-663, which establishes our procedures for ensuring that parents of ELLs have every  opportunity to participate in and have access to all programs and services for our students. Parents receive a copy of  the Bill of Rights and Responsiblities which include parent's rights regarding translation and interpretation services.  The school Language Access Coordinator (LAC) will turnkey training on language access to all staff members. LAC will  be responsible to post charts in the primary entrance of the school in the target languages the availability of  interpretation services. Both our Parent Coordinator and our LAC will be receiving training on policies and procedures  to meet compliance. We will continue to guide and monitor all relavant school personnel to follow compliance  procedures. Our school safety plan includes procedures to ensure parent accessiblity of translation services. We will  utilize the DOE website to provide information, parental rights to translation and Interpretation services and instruct  parents on how they can access services. Specialized bilingual pedagogues, in-house school staff, and parent  volunteers will be utitlized to translate and interpret information to parents and guardians through correspondence,  phone, or via e-mail in order to accomplish our translation and interpretation services goals according to the  Chancellor's Regulations.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      PS/IS 155 will make limited-English Proficient parents aware of their right to receive information by posting parent  informational brochures on the Parent Bulletin board located on the first floor upon entry to the building. The bulletin  board will display pertinent information to parents in the parents preferred language such as: Parent’s Bill of Rights,  school bell schedule, PTA information, the Parent Guide to Language Access and “I Speak Card”, and the use of the  Multilingual Welcome poster visible for all parents to see. Our Parent Coodinator will also be consulted as to the  needs of PS/IS 155 and for translations. Our Parent-Teacher Association, in collaboration with both General and  Special Education teachers, will maintain an open communication and have input into this process. Additionally, the  data and information we gather from completed School Emergency Contact -blue cards, (UPPG) ATS reports and  Parent/Guardian Home Language Identification surveys will be utilized to provide all parents with appropriate and  timely information in a language they can understand. A school-wide survey is also sent home with the students as a  needs assessment.           Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77     Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We conduct an annual language access services survey. The survey is given to parents that prefer a language other  than English and helps us gather feedback from parents on the language services they receive, and how the school  can better help parents throughout the school year. Our school is consistently monitoring language access of parents  and is implementing the feedback gathered from surveys to improve language services. Our parent coordinator, PTA  and LAC will help monitor parental language needs, and use feedback from parent surveys on the quality and  availability of services. We will have all parent correspondence translated into the parents preferred language, and  have all school announcements and procedures displayed in designated areas making them easily accessible to all  parents including limited English proficient parents. From the survey we notice there is a greater need to have Spanish  translation services for the majority of Spanish speaking parents. However, we will continue to address parents needs  and those who prefer a language other than English. We are giving translation and interpretation to parents in the  following targeted languages: Arabic, French, and Hatian Creole during Open- School teacher-Parent conferences,  Parent Orientations, assemblies. The main office staff is becoming more vigilant and aware of parents’ language  communication needs. Additionally, we are translating report card comments about student progress in the child’s  home language and using all personnel posible to reach our parents and provide them with the services they need.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78
