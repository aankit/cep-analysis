This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview      PS 16 School Mission   Students will engage in    a range of learning experiences    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9   to acquire a powerful foundation    so that they can pursue big questions, solve complex problems    and effectively communicate    and engage in the global community.                           2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P.S. 16, The Wakefield school, is an elementary school of approximately 350 students in the northeast Wakefield  section of the Bronx. The demographic makeup consists of 3% Asian, 59% Black, 28% Hispanic, 2% White, 5% English  Language Learners and 25% SWDs.      The Administrative Team begins the school year by reviewing school-wide data, including the June Instructional  Report, MOSL results, Quality Review feedback, Advance data and the item analysis of the New York State English  Language Arts and Mathematics assessments. Analysis of all available data provides the basis for all decisions that are  made to support school-wide improvement efforts. Our instructional programs are implemented and pedagogical  practices are adapted each year based on our core beliefs about how students learn best.       Rigorous Instruction:    The workshop model of instruction is utilized in all grades throughout all content areas. Our school-wide programs  include Fundations, Fountas and Pinnell Guided Reading (K-2), iReady, ReadyGen Literacy, Math Exemplars, My Math,  NYC DOE Passport Social Studies Curriculum, Pre-kindergarten Integrated Units of Study, and NYC DOE Amplify  Science Curriculum.      Teachers assess student participation in their learning process through the use of participation points, participation  rubrics and checklists, in addition to student self-assessment tools. Students maintain work portfolios that evidence  their growth throughout the school year. Across classrooms teachers use various formative assessments including  entrance and exit slips to assess students understanding of daily lessons, in order to modify instruction, revise  instructional student groups, and provide meaningful feedback to students.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10            Supportive Environment:   Within classrooms, students are challenged by their teachers to make their thinking visible through the use of  "Thinking Maps", Math Exemplars, partner, small group and whole class discussions, performance-based tasks and  special projects across the curriculum. Through the use of grade, content and genre specific rubrics, students self- assess, participate in peer assessments and then confer with their teachers for a final assessment.      In order to build a safe and inclusive school culture and include students in the process, we utilize the “Links of Pride”  system of recognizing, acknowledging and celebrating positive behavior as a class unit. “PAW Pride”, our version of  this positive citizenship incentive, builds strong bonds in the classroom and throughout the school.       Student voice is also promoted through the Student Government. Two representatives from each class in grades 2-5,  including special education classes, participate in service projects within the school and the school community. Fifth  Grade students participated in an Advisory Group where students facilitated an assembly for the school to launch our  Acts of Kindness program.          Collaborative Teachers:      The curricula and academic tasks at PS 16 are planned and refined using student work and data. Teachers use the NTC  Looking at Student Work Protocol (LASW) on a bi-monthly cycle during professional work time, grade meetings and  common planning periods. Our school schedule includes time for frequent weekly grade level common planning  periods (horizontal teams), bimonthly vertical team meetings during Monday professional development sessions,  articulation between service providers and classroom teachers, two period per week for mentoring and designated  times for classroom inter-visitations.       All teachers participate in data driven inquiry work that is routinized and supported by the administration. Grade  teams review Common Core Learning Standards, performance-based tasks, and data from grade level assessments to  assess student learning. During grade meetings they modify the curriculum to provide multiple entry points for our  diverse population of learners with a special focus on our students with disabilities and English language learners. This  practice strengthens the instructional capacity of teachers by allowing teachers on grade teams and on contiguous  grades to analyze the data and share best practices to support student learning at all levels.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Effective School Leadership:      All staff members were provided communique on written protocols as well as the required documentation for grade  meetings, parent communication, student conferences, flexible student groupings, progress monitoring, format of  instructional blocks, assessment tools, procedures for safety and discipline, and Chancellor’s Regulations. All  pedagogical staff members will receive an Accountability Calendar that outlines dates of interim assessments,  including analysis and review, in addition to designated time for curriculum modifications and reviews of student  work.      The professional development plan serves as a living document that outlines our current instructional initiatives and  the professional development that supports our staff, inclusive of teachers, educational assistants and support staff in  their continuous improvement efforts. Teachers receive training on the use of all of our school-wide technology  instructional tools, arts partnerships, and instructional programs. In addition, teachers receive support and additional  training on the use of the I-Ready, Coach Digital, and Teq. Grade Teams will also utilize Google drive for information  sharing and seamless communication.      Our full-time Individual Education Plan teacher and full-time Crisis Intervention Teacher along with our full-time  guidance counselor, social worker, and psychologist all serve to support our students' social and emotional needs  through participation on our Crisis Intervention/ School Climate Team, Response to Intervention, and School Safety  Committees.       Teacher teams (horizontal and vertical) were developed to distribute leadership roles to teachers. Each teacher team  consists of teachers from each grade, such as The Equity Team, Professional Development Team, Thinking Maps  Team, Math Team, ELA Team, Social Studies Team and Science Team, which meet bi-monthly.         Strong Family-Community Ties:      The school facilitates special academic programs and initiatives to encourage parent and community participation.  These programs include our Science Fair, Annual Community Fair, Open House where parents/guardians are  welcomed into the classroom to see instruction, Math Exemplar visits to classrooms, College and Career Awareness  Day and Father Figure Breakfast.      To communicate and celebrate our high academic expectations to parents, we communicate regularly with each  parent via telephone with our school-wide Voice Messaging System, prepare and distribute a monthly school calendar  with important dates (i.e. PTA and Title 1 Meetings, Community Education Council Meetings, school closings, etc.),  monthly newsletters from each grade, and teachers are available on Tuesdays from 2:25pm - 3:35pm to meet with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      parents. To recognize and celebrate students' success we facilitate Student Awards Assemblies on a tri-annual Basis.  In addition, each month we recognize students with perfect attendance.       The school funds a position for a full-time Crisis Intervention Teacher who conducts peer mediation between  students, in addition to meeting with families to resolve conflicts that arise. The Crisis Intervention Teacher and  guidance counselor collaborate to facilitate student assemblies and parent workshops for Respect for All Week and  throughout the year.      Although the school does not have a physical gymnasium or multi-purpose room, students across all grades, pre- kindergarten through fifth, participate in physical education and arts programs in all disciplines. We have partnered  with the Bronx Arts Ensemble. Through this partnership, our students engage in vocal music, visual art and dance.  Parents are invited to student performances throughout the year, enabling parents, especially those of at-risk  students, to see their child excelling in other mandated school subjects. In addition, the administration is able to  creatively use the schedule and the available physical space to provide opportunities for students to receive physical  education and health instruction.        Trust   To build trust this year, the administrative staff, parents, teachers and students will continue to work collaboratively  on the new initiatives established during the 2017-2018.      Social Emotional: For staff and students, we have partnered with NYC Department Of Health and Mental Hygiene, to  provide workshops on stress reduction, self management to improve staff functionality and support students.      Instructionally:   1. ELA: The lower grade teachers have voiced concerns regarding the lack of a phonics based curriculum to support  early literacy. To address this need, we have implemented Fundations and guided reading in grades K-2, supported by  a part time Literacy Coach to train them in these initiatives. Additionally, I-Ready provides all of our students in grades  K-5 with individualized lessons that target specific needs covering six domains in reading - phonological awareness,  phonics, high-frequency words, vocabulary and comprehension: close reading.       2. Math: According the the most recent state scores, only 25% of our students are performing at proficient levels. To  improve the math scores in P.S. 16, we have implemented the Math Exemplar 5-day protocol for explicit math  instruction in solving word problems within all classrooms daily. All teachers in K-5 participate in inter-visitations for  support with this initiative and to identify best teaching practices.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      Safety: To support the community needs, the school doors have been opened thirty minutes earlier for students in  grades 2-5 and ten minutes earlier for students in Pre-Kindergarten - 1. As a result, we have increased our  instructional time and families are able to report to their destinations on time.       District wide focus on boys of color: The school has an equity focus to support learning, and social emotional needs of  boys of color. We will continue our chess club at recess and will continue to have started dialogue with each teacher  during their initial planning conference and summative end-of-year conference around how to support this district  wide and school-wide goal. Additionally, we will partner with the Eagle Foundation for professional development that  will support our staff with meeting the needs of our young men of color.       The element of the framework that we will continue to focus on for the upcoming year is Rigorous Instruction.  Growth will be measured by the New York City School Survey.             3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   PS 16 has ten percent of our students residing in temporary housing and shelters. Our turnover rate has increased  steadily over the past few years. Due to this transient population, our school continues to struggle to meet the  expected citywide attendance rate. Administration along with our District Attendance Teacher, and members of the  School Attendance Committee have developed a comprehensive attendance plan and implemented attendance  procedures and follow-up measures to increase the percentage of student attendance school-wide, in attempts to  increase opportunities for student academic success.      90 % of our SWDs scored a level 1 and level 2 as measured by the NYS 2018 ELA Exam.      98 % of our SWDs scored a level 1 and level 2 as measured by the NYS 2018 MATH Exam.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Rigorous Instruction:    The workshop model of instruction is utilized in all grades throughout all content areas. Our school-wide programs  include Fundations, ReadyGen Literacy, Ready Math, NYC DOE Passport Social Studies Curriculum, Pre-kindergarten  Integrated Units of Study, and the New York City DOE Amplify Science Curriculum.      Teachers assess student participation in their learning process through the use of participation points, participation  rubrics and checklists in addition to student self-assessment tools. Students maintain work portfolios that show their  growth throughout the school year. Across classrooms teachers utilize entrance and exit slips to assess students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14      understanding of daily lessons in order to modify instruction, revise instructional student groups, and provide  meaningful feedback to students.       Evidence of rigorous student work products can be found on our bulletin boards, both inside and outside of the  classroom which display student work including rubrics, student self assessments, peer assessments, teacher  assessments and meaningful feedback as well as the task, current curriculum focus and the Common Core Learning  Standards addressed on the task. To ensure school-wide alignment in academic expectations, we use a school-wide  grading policy and scoring system. In addition, rubrics are developed by grade teams to ensure consistency across the  grades.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 11X016   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   356   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52        Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS16XWakefield School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A  of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy  to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the  school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   [PS 16X Wakefield School] will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ●providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ●fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ●providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ●sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      ●providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

During instruction questions were   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67         formatted using the question stems utilized during the NYSESLAT tests. Thematic units were aligned to the Scope and  Sequence in Science and Social Studies for grade bands, thus providing students with content related vocabulary and  experience in the topics for discussion, reading comprehension and writing. Writing assignments were constructed as  SCRs (short constructed responses) and ECRs ( extended constructed response) in alignment with the standards of both the  NYS ELA and NYSESLAT.  The rubrics used for assessment of tasks were aligned with those used in NYSESLAT and NYS ELA.In  addition, for the lower grades - MOSL writing,  Fountas and Pinnel reading and i-Ready data indicated that the instructional  focus for the entering ELLs should be based primarily on phonics: and learning to read and write in English.      7.

Freestanding ENL program.    .* PS 16 ENL program is primarily delivered through block scheduling due to the fact that the ELLs are spread out  between grades K-5.  Ells are placed in one class on each grade.  In order to satisfy the requirements of CR Part 154  this is the best way.  Students are grouped in two contiguous grade levels but also based on academic,  developmental  and linguistic needs.   * Block scheduling for entering and emerging students for 180 minutes ( four periods of 45 minutes each)  stand  alone - ENL instruction - language development- listening, speaking , reading, writing.  *  Block scheduling of 180 minutes -four periods of 45 minutes,  for Integrated instruction of ELA/Social Studies/  Science (Thematic Study) for varying proficiency levels. For example, the ENL teacher co-teaches the ELA lesson with  the class teacher four periods of 45 minutes each week.  There are ENL students of all levels in that class.  However,  for Kindergarten and First Grade, the ENL teacher co-mingles the group and teachers Social Studies with a common  theme for both grades.  * .5 unit of integrated teaching for commanding students in content area  * Co-teaching           b.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 16 Wakefield School                                                                              School DBN: 11X016  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
