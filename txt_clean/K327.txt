The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets, the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             8      Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.

Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             9      monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title   I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             10         1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: SCEP Overview      The mission is to provide a learning environment where scholars become critical thinkers, lifelong learners, and  powerful global leaders prepared to face the challenges of our world. Our mission is to provide our scholars with real  world experiences, where we can challenge their thinking.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Brownsville, Brooklyn is one of the few New York City neighborhoods where the major indicators of poverty are  concentrated. Within Brownsville, data reveals that six large public housing developments are at the heart of the  school district.       The school’s community is composed of passionate and committed administrators, parents, teachers, scholars, and  community members. Our shared goal is to maximize support for our students and introduce them to various cultural  programs, offering opportunities that they normally would not have access to. Moreover, we are tenacious about  convening a community-wide network of partners to target the economic instability at the root of Brownsville’s  housing, health and public safety challenges. This unified effort is channeled through the shared vision of the Dr. Rose  B. English school.      Under the leadership of the principal, our school continues to recognize the role as a major community partner that  must address the needs of this particularly hard-hit group of residents. The school continues to implement strategic  programs that strengthen the ties between Brownsville and the rest of our school community, as well as, expands  opportunities for all students and their families. These strategic programs concentrate on the allocation of existing  resources and the support from school-community networks. The ultimate outcome is to encourage the development  of our scholars to become global citizens that are prepared to meet the daily challenges that they will face in our  world.      A challenge at PS/IS 327 is to improve cultural awareness, social responsibility and personal growth of students. This  challenge will be addressed by alignment and use of the school strengths in maximizing the shared support of  stakeholders for our children through multiple strategic programs including:      1.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious  intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support)    Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice  Tenet 3 Statement of Practice  Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the  appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.  3.2   The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of  rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning  Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students.  Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction  (DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and  address student achievement needs.  The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner  within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the  arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities.  Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative  assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student  reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.   3.3   3.4   3.5   SOP(s)   Addressed   x   x   x   x               Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus:  Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the  most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources  should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review,  NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School  Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.     1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and   year.   2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   An area of strength in this tenet is the comprehensive plan for teachers to partner within and across all grades and  subjects to address student achievement. Our school focuses on teacher inquiry, and understands teacher teams are a  highly effective way improving instruction, thereby increasing student achievement. Our building graduates of the  Teacher Leadership Program (TLP) who will facilitate teacher inquiry and provide training around the inquiry process.  Comprehensive unit planning will also take place during teacher team/common planning sessions.       An additional strength in the presence of a highly effective Instructional coach, who will build teacher instructional  capacity. Through intense professional learning, modeling co-teaching and demo activities, teachers will receive the  instructional support they need in order to be productive.    Data collection and analysis will be fully interwoven into the culture of the school. Staff will use data to inform all  decisions.    According to Fountas and Pinnell data, the majority of students were reading in the beginning of the 2017-2018 school  year at a First grade level and below. During the mid-year assessment slight gains were noticed with some students  moving from a First grade level to a Second grade reading level. The analysis of the data revealed that many of the   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             15      students had a limited understanding of phonemic awareness, vocabulary and comprehension. As a result, curriculum  adjustments were made to address the needs of the students. The Wonders reading program was implemented in  Kindergarten to Second grade. A balanced literacy approach was utilized in grades 3 through 5. The final Spring Fountas  and Pinnell (F&P) results, indicated gains in Kindergarten through grades 2 of students reading on level and or  approaching grade level. Grades 3 through 5 showed slight gains however, adjustments to the reading curriculum for  the fall are being made. The Wonders program will be used school-wide. During the school year of 2018-2019, F&P  assessments will be monitored to measure the proficiency of students reading on or approaching grade level. Students  who are below grade level will receive additional supports through our WIN period. It is evident that student  improvements in F&P levels will result in a direct correlation of improved scores on the NYS ELA Common Core  assessment.   In the area of math, baseline assessments from Go Math were administered in the beginning of the 2017-2018 school  year to grades k through 5. The results from the assessments displayed that many of our students were below level in all  of the mathematical strands. As a result, targeted skill based lessons were utilized to address the student's areas of  need. Some improvements were evident through data from the Math Performance Based assessments, however it still  remains that students are deficient in their conceptual understanding of math and fluency. Curriculum adjustments are  being made to align math concepts with the real world. In addition, mathematical games and fluency practice will be  implemented to assist students with the retention of number facts. It is evident that improvements in students  understanding of math concepts and fluency will yield gains in the Math Performance Based assessments and NYS Math  Common Core assessments.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, the number of grade K-5 (inclusive of English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities) students  performing on grade level in ELA and Mathematics will increase by 10%, as measured by Fountas & Pinnell (ELA), K-2  NYC Performance Task (Math) and 3-5 Performance Series (Math).           2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             16   Key Personnel  Who is responsible  for implementing  and overseeing the  activity/strategy?

What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and   year.   2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?      An area of strength in this tenet is the comprehensive effort to cultivate the development of overarching systems and  partnerships that support and sustain social and emotional development. Several initiatives have been established. The  Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) system and Class Dojo have been implemented across all grades.  Class Dojo encourages positive student behavior and engagement. It also provides timely feedback to students, parents,  and teachers in the classroom. School-wide Lucky Bucks are used to reinforce positive behavior according to the  behavioral matrix.       A concerted effort has been made to prioritize the articulation of safety to all stakeholders as a priority In PS/IS 327.  Based on the school NYCDOE School Survey 2017-18 86% of all students felt safe in classes, over 100% of teachers felt  safe in class, and 89% of parents felt their children were safe in school. All students, parents, teachers, administrators  and community leaders are encouraged to engage in sustaining the effort to build a safe learning environment. On a  monthly basis all stakeholders are encouraged to participate in a Think Tank brainstorming session with the  administration to address the concerns and needs of the school community. Under the new administration, systems   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             21      have been established to address safety procedures regarding arrival, dismissal, visitors, and transitions in the school  building.      There are several ways in which the school leader and student support staff work collaboratively with teachers’ to  develop their capacity and skills in using data to respond to students’ social and emotional developmental health needs.  First, training is provided to analyze and develop class action plans using the Class Dojo reports. Second, attendance  data is shared with teachers and used to inform parent outreach efforts and tailored interventions based on individual  student needs. Moreover, teacher supports are differentiated based on both the teacher and student needs.      The priority need in this tenet is the articulation and systemic buy-in by all stakeholders to the shared vision for social  and emotional developmental health connected to learning experiences under the new administration. Based on the  NYCDOE School Survey 2015-16, the response to the schools offering of a wide variety of course, extracurricular  activities, and services that keep students’ interested and engaged was rated 82% by Parents, 67% by Teachers, and a  63% by Students. This year we have implemented the school-wide PBIS program, Class Dojo, that uses research based  practices to foster student social and developmental health, motivate student participation, and engage the school  community. The overall focus is establishing trust and building relationships with stakeholders in order to channel a  unified commitment and maximize constructive participation as support in building a safer and healthier environment  for families, teachers, and students.

Accordance with Race to the Top, an Annual Professional Performance Review (APPR) was developed in order to  evaluate teacher effectiveness. As this evaluation system is still relatively new, it is comprised of new metrics and rubrics  for evaluating teacher practices. The Danielson Framework is the rubric that was adopted to measure teacher practices.  it is imperative that teachers receive the training and support they need in order to be successful in moving students.  After continuous review of teacher effectiveness, review of teacher advance data from the 2017-2018 school year, and  findings from professional learning needs assessment, it was determined that teachers could benefit from more  professional learning. Our 2016-2017 Preliminary Overall teacher rating indicates that 83% of our teachers demonstrate  Effective or Highly Effective teaching practices (81% effective and 2% highly effective). 12% of teachers demonstrate  developing teacher practices and 5 % demonstrate ineffective teaching practices. We want at least 90% of teachers  demonstrating effective or highly effective teaching practices. This will directly impact overall student learning and  achievement. In an effort to improve teaching practice, we understand that we must provide various professional  learning opportunities to teachers. This will in turn improve both teaching and learning.

For the past few years, student attendance has been a problem of  concern. The primary function of school is to educate children, however they need to be present in order to do so.  School leadership has charged members of the school community with the shared-responsibility of improving student  attendance percentages. In doing so, an action team of student, teacher and community leaders will be formed, whose  mission will be to create/implement structures and activities aimed at remedying our attendance problem.    During the 2017-2018 school year our attendance rate was 86.9%. By January 2018, we increased the attendance rate to  88%, however by June 2018, our attendance data declined and we ended the year with a 86.8% year-to-date attendance  rate. Therefore, we did not meet our goal for the 2017-2018 school year. We will revisit this goal and employ additional  strategies and refine existing strategies in an effort to improve attendance during the 2018-2019 school year. We now  understand that a major focus has to be placed on January through June, as this is the time when attendance  percentages declined during the 2017-2018 school year. We will also be consistent in our efforts from the beginning to  the end of the school year.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.       2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and  paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   High quality professional development is defined by several interactive factors. It implies rich content that is  specifically chosen to deepen and broaden the knowledge and skills of teachers, administrators, paraprofessionals,  and other key educational staff members. Our high-quality professional development is based on substantive well- defined objectives, structure, reflecting, well-thought out delivery, need, efficient use of time, varied and effective  styles of pedagogy, discourse and application , and the use of formative and summative assessments.    Some activities include:   Monthly professional learning provided by the superintendent and district colleagues   Monthly network team professional learning sessions   Needs assessments of teachers, paraprofessionals, and support staff   Professional learning opportunities aligned to needs assessment data           Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information,  early intervention services, etc.).  Our school host PreK and Kindergarten open houses prior to the beginning of school, principal led tours of our  building, and recruitment sessions from the local day care providers.   The Pre-kindergarten teachers use a thematic based curriculum, which they align with the Pre-Kindergarten Common  Core Learning Standards. The curriculum is differentiated in order to meet the needs of all students; various access  points exist for ELL students, Students with Disabilities, etc. Pre-Kindergarten teachers participate in school wide  professional development in addition to pre-kindergarten professional development offered by New York City.    There is a huge emphasis on transitioning pre-kindergarten students and their parents. Students experience the “Day- and-Life” of a kindergartener. They visit and explore kindergarten classrooms, have breakfast and lunch in the  cafeteria, participate in story time and a variety of learning activities. Parents are given the opportunities to attend  workshops: what to expect in kindergarten, how to transition your pre-k child into kindergarten, etc. Parents are also  provided with resource material ensuring a smooth transition. Baseline data is provided to kindergarten teachers  through vertical articulation with pre-kindergarten teachers.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teachers work collaboratively to create common assessments. Teachers create, select and reflect upon assessments  during their common prep time, grade-level meetings, and teacher team meetings. Teachers are encouraged to  evaluate and reevaluate assessments as needed. Teachers’ feedback is used by administration to guide the purchasing  of materials, as well as scheduling of assessments.    Teachers engage in ongoing professional development surrounding assessments; how to administer assessments  (DRA, Writing on Demand, etc.), creating effective formative and summative assessments, using assessments to drive  instruction.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             45         Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             46      semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             47      Section 10: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS/IS 327, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       P.S. / I.S. 327 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students        providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             48            Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.         In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   Funding will allow for the school to provide additional academic and social-emotional support to students and their  families. Also, the Community School Director will work directly with students, parents and staff to foster a  community of trust and mutual respect.     Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    By June 2019, there will be a 10% increase in parent and family attitudes toward school as measured by the NYC  school survey.B         Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  Achieving the community school goal will directly impact the ELT goal. Research indicates that trust and morale are  directly related to performance. When students and their families trust the school and feel supported by the school,  they are more likely to accept recommendations made by the school and support the school in the education of their  child.        Part 2 – Community School Partnerships Core Services Action Plan   Part 2a. Identify the Community-based Organization (CBO) partnerships that you will develop in ELT, Attendance  Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & Wellness, their target student population(s), and scope of the services  provided.

Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following:  1.   Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and  together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will  lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   2.   3.   4.   School community and SLT will interview candidates for the Community Director position, and hire the best candidate  for the position. A student needs assessment will be conducted to identify the overall, and individual needs of our  student body. Resources and support will be provided based on the needs assessment. Parents and families will be  engaged in every aspect of the school, including decision making. Also, administration will meet monthly with  community school director to analyze data and plan.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kimberly Chance Peart, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             62                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                 School DBN:   Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
