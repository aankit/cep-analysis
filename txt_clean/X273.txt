This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission    Section 4: CEP Overview      Frederick Douglass Academy V's mission is to provide ALL students with ongoing opportunities to actively engage in  rigorous educational experiences that promote and support their critical thinking and strengthens their academic and  socio-emotional development.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Vision    The Vision of Frederick Douglass Academy V is to create a learning environment with clear expectations where ALL  students can reach their highest academic and socio-emotional potential, obtain college and career readiness skills  and be inspired by every stakeholder to become agents of positive social change ready to successfully meet the  challenges of the 21st Century.          The Instructional Focus of Frederick Douglass Academy V is to actively engage ALL students in higher level order  thinking learning activities by developing data driven rigorous instruction that is in alignment with content standards  and promote college and career readiness skills.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Frederick Douglass Academy V is a middle school grades 6 to 8 that is located in the Bronx and it is committed to  empowering students to become high school and college ready critical thinkers by creating a learning environment  that nurtures and supports the academic and socio-emotional growth of all students. Our students graduate  academically and socially minded, ready to succeed at the high school and college of their choice and capable of  meeting the demands of the 21st century.   We have developed strong CBO partnerships with the New York Junior Tennis &Learning and Brave-Hearts  Foundation with whom we work closely during the after school day to support the academic and socio-emotional  development of our students. There is a strong focus on supporting student learning in literacy, mathematics and  science as well as providing our scholars the opportunity to engage in meaningful extracurricular activities. In  collaboration with these community based organizations, we are focusing on strategies to support the academic as  well as the socio-emotional development of every FDA V Scholar. Frederick Douglass Academy V is committed to  provide scholars with a balanced instructional program that focuses on preparing scholars to be successful in high  school and college.      Based on the New York State ELA and Mathematics Examinations, the i-Ready Diagnostics Assessment for reading and  mathematics, and department based line assessments, it is evident that a significant percentage of our students  continue to be struggling readers. Additionally, we recognize that literacy rates are directly tied to high school  graduation rates and the ability to be college and career ready. Finally, we recognize that literacy rates impact student  performance in each of the content areas. An analysis of all of these data sources was used to inform our decisions on  our specific areas of focus and we expect to see evidence of student impact as we work on aligning of our pedagogical  practices to support student needs.   While we are still working towards improving our curriculum as part of year-long work, we are beginning to see  evidence of students benefiting from this work. As a result of this work we have observed the following:        Students are able cite evidence from various texts and use the evidence to support a claim.  Students are completing common core aligned tasks that demonstrate knowledge of specific concepts  covered throughout the various content areas      Content teachers incorporate content-specific literary and non-fiction texts in an effort to build knowledge   about the world.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      This year 30.6% of students met proficiency in ELA an increase of 8.8% from last year and 14.5 % met proficiency in  Math resulting in an increase of 8.1% from last year.   A review of the mean growth percentile for 6th grade revealed that there was a combined growth percentile of 48.8  and 53.2 in ELA and 44.5 in math. The mean growth percentile for 7th grade included a combined growth percentile  of 52.7 and 54.4 in ELA and 50.9 in math. In the 8th grade, it was reported a combined growth percentile of 45.1 and  42 in ELA and 48.3 in math.      Data also revealed a total of 49% combined growth percentile for all grades during the 2017-2018 school year as  compared to the 50% NYS growth percentile.      Behavioral Expectations   We have a school-wide structured behavior management system that consists of rules which are the same across  grade levels. We also use PBIS that includes Douglass Dollars and result in students being positively rewarded  individually or as a whole class. In addition, we are working on the ladder of discipline and consequences over the  summer in order to insure consistency across classrooms. Rules, Ladder of Consequences, and Teacher Creed will be  posted and teachers and students refer to both as needed.   All students and parents/guardians will receive the Student and Parent/Guardian Handbook,12th Edition 2017-2018  (the “Handbook“) during the Frederick Douglass Academy V (“FDA V”) orientation or when they enter FDA V. One  Handbook will be given to each student for the use of the student and his/her family. It is the responsibility of  students and parents/guardians to read the entire Handbook. No later than five (5) days after receiving the  Handbook, the following forms must be completed, signed and returned to the first period teacher:   1) Parent/Guardian's Frederick Douglass Academy V Pledge and   2) Student's Frederick Douglass Academy V Pledge      Partnerships   Our school has partnered with New York Junior Tennis League (NYJTL), a Community Based Organization designed to  develop the character of young people through Tennis and Education for a lifetime of success on and off the court.  NYJTL help students build knowledge, skills, and self-confidence. It nurtures their aspirations through a variety of  quality enrichment opportunities that include academic math and ELA support, Leadership, Dance, Robotics, Cooking  and Nutrition, In alignment with our beliefs as school, NYJTL seeks to foster academic, social and emotional well-being  of our students in a safe environment, build skills that support academic achievement and raise participant  expectations and confidence, cultivate youth leadership and engage parents/guardians to support these goals. In  addition we have partnered with the Brave-Hearts Foundation to provide students with mentoring support, academic  enrichment/intervention, music electives and other support to improve the academic and socio-emotional  development of FDAV Scholars.    This will be our third year accepted into the Urban Advantage Science Program. We are excited and looking forward  to a science rich and interactive curriculum, where our students are given the opportunity to actively engage in  science projects and activities. our science teachers will be attending PDs throughout the school year at various  cultural institutions. Students and families will have opportunities to visit many of the museums and cultural  institutions throughout the city both with the school and on their own. Additionally, science teachers will take   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      students to these sites for experiential learning. The program also provides several materials for hands on learning  experiences.         Preparation for High School   Students and parents are aided in the high school application process through Parent workshops offered and  individual meetings with the guidance department as they choose the best high schools to service their individual  needs. Furthermore, high schools come to our school to visit and recruit our students. Students are encouraged to  attend high school fairs and open houses. There is also tutoring offered for those students who wish to take the  Specialized High School exam.       Other strategic partnerships FDAV has initiated and leveraged for the 2018-2019 school-year include: Urban  Advantage and Bronx Zoo to strengthen science instruction in the classroom. To support Common Core aligned  planning and instruction, there will be an emphasis on questioning and discussion and student engagement, in the  Social Studies and Science classrooms. The ELA Peer Collaborative Teacher (PCT) will work together with school  administration to support ELA in creating a true readers / writer's workshop to hands on Mathematics instruction to  engage students at all levels with the Common Core Reading / Writing Common Core ELA standards. We also selected  a Math Lead Teacher to support math teachers and strengthen the math department as we aim to challenge our  mathematicians to be inquisitive thinkers and problem solvers. The Math Lead Teacher will support rigorous  instruction in all ICT classrooms with an emphasis on planning to ensure both teachers are partnering at full capacity.  Our science teachers will continue to work with Urban Advantage in inquiry based planning and instruction. To help  develop our scholars creativity, will will continue to work with Arts Matter to immerse students in theater instruction  2 days per week; and Inside Broadway to expose them to the backstage of Broadway- each grade will become experts  in one aspect of production (lighting, costumes, set design, etc.) and come together for a full tour and sharing of  expertise.  All grades will follow the ELA Department Reading and writing project curricula. Students will participate in book clubs  and extensive Non-Fiction research. We strive to build a bridge between reading and writing development to enhance  our student’s enjoyment, as well as, increase confidence in their own growth in these areas.  Teacher collaboration is evident by the voluntary participation in a multitude of clubs. In addition, teachers  participate in administration meetings weekly, to discuss school policy and procedures. On-going professional  2018-2019 SCEP-FL 12 development is (evident). Every Monday is dedicated to professional development in which  teachers share effective practices through teacher designed workshops. Using the distributed leadership model, lead  teachers work at grade and content level under the administration supervision analyzing student achievement and  academic data to inform instruction in curricular design, unit planning, and lesson planning. Teachers, administrators  and counselor maintain an open communication via digital documentation system: Class Dojo. Parents and students  are able to communicate with teachers through this system. Students and parents are able to monitor student  progress on a daily basis. The school calendar is disseminated to all students and mailed to parents, to maintain an  open communication.         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      Students with Disabilities and English Language Learners are subgroups of high priority and concerns at Frederick  Douglass Academy V. The FDA V staff community has identified SWD and ELLS as a focus group because data reveals  that they are not meeting grade level targets as their non-SWD and non-ELLs peers. Student with Disabilities and  English Language Learner Students are in need of differentiated instruction that meets their individual academic and  socio-emotional needs. We also identified varies additional support that must be implemented to ensure that their  specific needs are being addressed. These needs are but not limited to: opportunity to engage in collaborative  learning to promote and encourage students to share their ideas with peers and to engage in peer review, Instruction  to be differentiated to support multi-entry levels, project based learning opportunities to maximize critical thinking  and increase learning discussions, targeted/individualized instruction to increase student learning. It has also been  concluded that there is a need for educators to translate instructional materials to support ELL students master  concepts, these support will include but are not limited to; dictionaries, scaffold text, lower lexile level text and  glossaries just to name a few.    We currently offer ICT, SETSS and SC services and our school is in the process of continuing to train our special  education and general education teachers how to best meet the needs of our special student populations by  implementing ICT effective models of instruction.             4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   A key focus area from the Framework for great schools is in building a coherent curriculum. only 36% of teachers said  that the curriculum and instruction are well coordinated across grade levels. Given this, we are focusing work to align  the curriculum across the grade level with a central theme as well as from grade to grade with entry and exit points  and common assessments.       Based on data analysis from the State Assessments and NYSELAT, our grade 6-8 students demonstrate a need for  support in the areas of ELA vocabulary and academic language development. In math, the focus must be to improve  planning and support for complex mathematical problem solving by understanding vocabulary. These goals are  specific to our school population of learners but also to our ELL students who have shown declines in achieving levels  of proficiency on ELA state exams that were mostly attributed to questions that focus on understanding complex text,  language and math problem solving skills. With these needs in mind, our Instructional Focus and Professional Learning  Plan emphasize further teacher inquiry on Questioning and Discussion using academic vocabulary and discourse as  they respond to both teachers and student initiated questions.   The Frederick Douglass Academy V's 2018-2019 instructional focus is to actively engage ALL students in higher level  order thinking learning activities by developing data driven rigorous instruction that is in alignment with content  standards and promote college and career readiness skills.      Teachers will collaborate to ensure that they improve literacy and math performance levels as they engage in the  implementation of a team-approach to develop strong lessons and curriculum units that focus on delivering a student  centered, authentic, collaborative tasks approach.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13            School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 12X273   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   224   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

In response to the Framework for Great Schools-Rigorous Instruction as well as feedback from our latest Performance  Review, we have decided to review and strengthen our parent and community engagement. By increasing family  events, we will continue to foster strong family/community relationships that will build greater   support and capacity in order to strengthen both the academic and social emotional needs of our students.         We strive to ensure that individual students and particular sub-groups make progress from year to year. A review of  our ELA and Math state scores and student performance on the MOSL assessments, indicated that we need to focus  our instructional program to support student development on literacy skills. Specifically, using persuasive writing,  argumentative writing and using evidence to support claims.         After conducting an analysis of the documentation resulting from the Looking at Student Work ongoing  collaborative inquiry using the New Teacher Mentor protocols, it was determined that teachers focused on the areas  that needed to be modeled more explicitly for students that did not meet benchmarks. We need to ensure rigorous  instruction is being provided for students at all levels.         Feedback from our Principal Performance Review and Instructional Rounds indicated that we need to focus on  developing cognitively challenging activities that support student progress in meeting and exceeding standards.  Specifically, we need to focus on questioning/ discussion techniques, and creating opportunities for student to  deepen their understanding of the content.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15      Administration provides teachers with pedagogical support, highlighting instructional strengths and support for areas  in need of improvements, inter-visitation opportunities to learn best practices from their colleagues, cross grade  professional conversations, to lean and share resources, access to CCLS curriculum, student data, pacing calendars  and and conferences.

Based on the Framework element from 2017-2018 it is evident that the there was an increase in strong family  community ties and creating a supporting environment for students. We are working on increasing Trust among all  stakeholders, improving the collaboration between teachers and providing a rigorous instruction to improve student  learning.    Looking at teacher advance data as well as student outcomes, it is evident that we need to strengthen teacher  practice and support teacher collaboration. At the heart of teacher growth is systematic and sustained collaboration  and inquiry related to teacher practice. Therefore, teacher teams will meet weekly and use specific protocols to look  at student work and analyze their curriculum. Therefore, teacher growth will be supported through a combination of  weekly grade team meetings, content meetings and common planning periods, lesson studies within content  meetings, Integrated Co-Teaching Classes with paired ENL and General Education Teachers as well as Special  Education and General Education Teachers. In order to monitor the implementation of these methods, Grade Team  Leaders will submit weekly agendas and weekly meeting minutes.    We have identified our Students with Disabilities and ELL students as a priority subgroup as the state test data  demonstrate that they are are not making significant academic improvement based on the ELA and Math  Examinations.       scoring a high level 1 overall, (1.9 ELA and 1.99 Math).

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and the community in our school. Therefore, our school will create and implement a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between our school and the families. In  order to foster a more effective and inclusive school program, all stakeholders, particularly parents, must be provided  with varied points of access for communication with the school leaders and faculty. In order to facilitate fluid and  continuous communication with parents, and increase parent involvement in school culture and management, FDAV  will create and update the school website complete with email links to all staff members. This increase in the range of  communication mechanisms with parents is expected to increase the number of parents monitoring student progress  and attending parent teacher conferences. Presently, FDAV utilizes our Parent Coordinator as a point person for  parent contact. Our Parent Coordinator also serves as liaison between families and the school.    Strengths:   ● The school leader makes it a school wide priority for all students and their families to be aware of the school-wide  expectations and plan pertaining to graduating from school and provides age appropriate information about high  school to students and their families.   ● The school staff uses a plan to communicate with parents (i.e., class dojo, skedula, phone-conferences, and  communicating in a variety of ways) concerning student progress, achievement, and needs.   ● The entire school community ensures that student data is shared in a way that families can understand their child’s  learning needs and successes, proactively advocate for their children, and partner with the school to provide  appropriate student support.      Priority Needs:    The PA and SLT have been re-established, but attendance is low.    We have low turn out for parent workshops    Ways outside of phone calls home that will communicate with parents about positive or challenging behaviors,  grades, upcoming events etc.    Need more parents' email addresses and to register for Skedula   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Our data states that 80% of parents say that school staff regularly communicate with them about how parents can  help their child learn. We will therefore have a priority subgroup as our SWD and ENL students as these students  often need more and different needs to access the curriculum.

NA        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     We have both school-wide and classroom based assessments. Our assessment plan details both. School wide  assessments consist of the DRP, iReady, School Net baseline assessments and periodic assessments. Teachers aid in  selecting these at the end of every academic year for the following year. Teachers craft their own classroom  assessments as per their curriculum map and essential questions.    ● Assessment Committee will be developed that votes and/or offers input to the section or process of assessments    ● Teacher teams review the effectiveness of school-wide and/or common assessments       ● Surveys are conducted on teacher knowledge, comfort, and abilities with specific strategies so appropriate PD can  provided and inter-visitations can be effectively set-up to encourage specific assessment practices       ● Teachers and teacher teams help design rubrics that effectively assess students and modify and revise based on  feedback       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      ● Teacher teams will help create, align, and modify school wide grading policies    ● PD always includes a reflection piece so that all voices are heard in terms of the assessment practices and the  needed PD    ● Based on observations and PPO feedback from 2016-17 school year.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45     combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Frederick Douglas Academy V, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Frederick Douglas Academy V will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;    Investing in an online grading program called Jupiter Grades so that parents can see their updated child's grade at  any given moment;    Developing a user friendly website to communicate important messages to parents and create a way for parents  to be in touch with teachers.   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., /State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the lementary and Secondary Education Act.   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49       Moving to an online grading system to empower parents and students to know exactly what their grade is    creating a user friendly website with announcements, teacher pages and any other information easily accessible.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Frederick Douglass Academy V utilizes  various assessment tools and methods  to evaluate and assess the literacy skills of our  ELL students. These assessment tools include but are not limited to; NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, ELA/MATH State Exams, i- Ready,  teacher made assessments, department unit tests, common core performance tasks, Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark  Assessment System grades K-8 among other informal assessments.     These assessments provide meaningful academic insight for every student. We are able to calculate student's reading (fluency)  and comprehension  level.  Informal writing assessments provide teachers with grammar and writing mechanics insight that is  later used to guide instructional planning and differentiation instruction to support the academic and social emotional  development of our ELLs.  At the beginning of the school year, all teachers collaborate on analyzing the previous year's  NYSESLAT data to determine what language interventions need to be put in place to ensure success within the  classroom.  English Language Learner  students are continually assessed by content teachers as well as the ELL provider to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      determine language proficiency through running records (reading assessment) (Fountas and Pinnell), vocabulary acquisition  (academic and social), writing level assessments (ELA and content areas).     Our students also take a variety of student mearsures including Computer Adaptive Tests in Math and ELA and Performance  Tasks in ELA, Math, and Social Studies and Science. Their measures are directly aligned with the Common Core Standards and  the data from these measures will help our teachers further develop an instructional plan to meet the specific needs of our  ELLs.     Another component  of our school's curriculum is i-READY computerized online instructional program. This program is  incorporated  in class instruction  (ELA/MATH) as well as  online student access which is individually targeted for each student.  This program will be very effective for analyzing the specific needs of our ELL population and aid the teacher in creating  targeted skill groups as well as targeted individual instruction.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Throughout the school 2017-2018 school year, instructional leaders will collaborate to create a learning school community  where teachers will attend ongoing professional development to support the academic and social emotional development of  our English Language Learner students.  2017-2018  Professional Development  topics will include the  effective implementation of evidence-based instructional programs, understanding and utilizing assessment data to guide and  plan effective instruction for ELLs,  Using the guiding UDL principles to support the academic development of ELLs. Teachers  will have the opportunity and be encourage to work collaborative to analyze, discuss formative and informative assessments  to plan instruction for ELLs. Instructional leaders will meet systematically with lead teachers and department heads to provide  individual support to teachers.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Some of the  baseline/benchmark assessments that we are currently using to identify baseline, progress and areas of need for  our ELLs are NYSITELL,  NYSESLAT, ELA/MATH State Exams, i-Ready,  teacher made assessments, teacher observation,  department unit tests, common core performance tasks, running records,  Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System  grades K-8 among other informal assessments. Some of these assessments will be administered to  students multiple times  during the school year as a way to monitor and track student progress and make the necessary instructional adjustments to  meet the academic and social emotional needs of our ELLs.  As a school, we use multiple measures to assess the overall  performance of ELL students.          4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    In collaboration with the ENL provider, the school will develop targeted ELLs  instructional  groups based on results of  formative and informative assessments. Interventions will include stand-alone/integrated methods of instructional support  utilizing evidence-based instructional practices, direct Instruction, mediated scaffolding, multi-tiered intervention support  model focusing on skill deficiencies as defined by results of formative and informative assessments.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]        Our school understands the importance of creating a strong Response to Intervention (RtI) model in order to provide ELLs  with  rigorous, culturally responsive instruction.  We provide additional academic support to all ELLs who scored below  specified levels of performance on the annual English language proficiency assessment.  The academic support services we  provide for ELLs are in direct alignment with schoolwide Academic Intervention services.  We use the data provided from  various assessments to determine the individual instructional support needed for students to be academically successful.  As  highlighted on the RtI guidelines, our students are provided with the increasingly intensive, targeted instruction designed to  match their learning needs as demonstrated by the results of  multiple assessments.  Instructional support offered at our  school include but are not limited to: rigorous and evidence-based curriculum focusing on English Language development for   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         ELLs, activities and experience targeted to specific students based on assessments results in addition to the core instruction,  a  small percentage of students are in need of intensive and individualized instruction (small group or  1:1, in order to meet their  academic needs).            6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Our school uses our data from  NYSITELL,  NYSESLAT, ELA/MATH State Exams, i-Ready,  teacher made assessments, teacher  observation, department unit tests, common core performance tasks, running records,  Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark  Assessment System grades K-8 among other informal assessments, to  evaluate and inform our ELL programs.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Peer Collaborative Teachers  in collaboration with the ENL and core subject teachers will meet regularly to disseminate  assessment results and make the necessary adjustments to instructional programs.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.       To ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided for all proficiency levels, ENL instruction is  delivered in our school through a combination of services. ELL students are heterogeneously grouped by grade and  classes, they travel as a group by grade.  ELLs  receive ENL  services as mandated by CR Part 154.2.  These ELLs ENL  services will be provided during their scheduled class periods. Whenever possible, our ELL special education students  are mainstreamed into the General Ed ELA classrooms where they receive a large portion of their ELL services.  In  addition, a portion of the units of support are delivered during the ELLs ELA class period with the remainder of the  servicing being provided throughout the day in other content areas.  In addition, ELLs receive additional support  across all content areas during the school's Strategic reading periods.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N\A       c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N \ A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?      In order to ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes are being provided according to the proficiency levels  a spread sheet is created with each students name, ID number, and proficiency level.  After the spread sheet is created the ELL  coordinator breaks down the minutes, either 360 or 180 minutes and whether it will be stand-alone ENL, integrated ENL, or  flexibility. Students who proficiency level is at a entering level will receive 1 unit (180 minutes) of stand-alone ENL and 1 unit of  integrated ENL. Students who proficiency level is at a emerging level will receive .5 unit (90 minutes) of stand-alone ENL, 1 unit  of integrated ENL, and either .5 unit of stand alone ENL or integrated ENL depending on the individual student. A student  whose proficiency level is transitioning will receive .5 unit of integrated ENL and .5 unit of stand-alone ENL or integrated ENL,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      depending on the student. A student whose proficiency level is expanding will receive 1 unit of study in integrated ENL. A  student whose proficiency level of commanding will receive .5 unit of integrated ENL.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Stand-Alone ENL: The ELL students receive their content subjects throughout the day. The ENL provider will pull the entering  and emerging students out of the classroom for stand-alone ENL. The ELL teacher will provide strategies and guidelines for the  content teachers to help meet the linguistic needs of the ELL students. In addition, along with the ELL provider, teacher’s  analysis the data from the NYSESLAT as well as the state ELA and Math exams to determine the individual academic needs of  each ELL student.  In order to make content comprehensible and to foster language development and to meet the demands of  the Common Core Learning Standards both each content department work closely together with the ELL Coordinator to review  and develop their units. The ELL coordinator works with each core content to make sure the instruction approaches and  methods used to help all ELL students. The ELL coordinator helps each content teacher to infuse ELL student’s home language  as much as possible as when developing a unit.           Integrated ENL: The ELL students receive their content subjects throughout the day.  The ENL provider will push in to  some of the ELL student content classes. Content area teachers use ELL strategies guidelines to meet the linguistic needs of ELL  students.  In addition, along with the ELL provider, teacher’s analysis the data from the NYSESLAT as well as the state ELA and  Math exams to determine the individual academic needs of each ELL student.  In order to make content comprehensible and  to foster language development and to meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards both each content  department work closely together with the ELL Coordinator to review and develop their units. The ELL coordinator works with  each core content to make sure the instruction approaches and methods used to help all ELL students. The ELL coordinator  helps each content teacher to infuse ELL student’s home language as much as possible as when developing a unit.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native languages throughout the year. 22 out of 24 ELL students native language is  Spanish.  Our ELL students can take the Spanish LAB, have conferences in their native language, read and write in their native  language, and complete teacher created assessment in their native language.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    A. SIFE:  SIFE students need literacy skills in the L1 and \ or L2 for the study of all academic subjects and background knowledge  to take them to grade level. Our instructional plan for SIFE students is for rigorous curriculum with technological support,  intensive academic literacy instruction, preferably in both L1 and L2, content knowledge taught in L1 whenever possible to  bring them up to grade level, and intensive ENL instruction.    B. Newcomer: For newcomer ELL students there are also extensive appropriate interventions. The ELL English courses are  essential for the newcomer student because they provide the necessary second language acquisition curriculum. Additional  support is provided from classroom content area teachers trained in ELL techniques. Some ELLs require more extensive  support. ELL mainstream support provides ELLs with extended time in a teacher support environment. The level of acceptable  additional support at entering level is more extensive for newcomer ELLs because the natural process of second language  acquisition is extensive and often unique to the strengths and weakness of the individual students.  Newcomer ELLs are not  considered for moving to the next level of the intervention process until there is adequate evidence that they student is not  academically successful due to reasons beyond the normal struggles of second language acquisition (using measurable  evidence).   C. Developing: For ELL students who are developing we use many interventions and strategies. These strategies are used for all  ELL students but most are target for our developing ELL students. All teachers, no matter what subject, are literacy teachers,  so throughout our school we use read-aloud, shared readings, small-group instruction, independent reading, think-aloud,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      shared writing, and independent writing.   D. Long Term : The interventions for Long Term ELLs are more individualized for two reasons. First, issues other than second  language acquisition may be the source of academic difficulties for students who are significantly struggling academically after  four years.  Therefore, their academic products require closer scrutiny outside of second language acquisition to determine the  source of academic difficulties. Second, Long Term ELLs often require literacy and\or academic content intervention supports  that are best provided by general education interventions.  Support for Long Term ELLs are similar to those of Special Needs  students. They are provided through high quality differentiated instruction and ELL English course for students who still exhibit  second language errors. High quality differentiated instruction techniques grant ELLs access to grade level appropriate  material. There are many possible reasons why students remain in ELL beyond an expected time line.  The language acquisition  process takes longer for some students, or there are significant gaps in the student’s education that have negatively impacted  literacy.  There might also be an underlying disability that has not been identified.  In order to best find the appropriate  interventions at any level the most appropriate type of support for the student must be determined.   E. Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status:  Former ELL students still receive services after testing proficient \  commanding on the NYSESLAT for at least two years following the school year in which a student is exited from ELL status. The  ELL student will receive all the interventions and strategies that helped them score proficient on the NYSESLAT. The former ELL  students will receive at least one half of one unit of student of English as a new language, or 90 minutes per week, and are  eligible for certain specified testing. During this unit of student the ELL teacher will do regular check up with the former ELL  student to make sure the student is maintaining good grades and is not struggling with the curriculum.  Former ELL students  still receive their modifications on state and local assessments. In addition, if necessary, these students receive services and  supports within their classroom environments through constant communication between the ELL provider and classroom  teachers and ongoing assessment and data analysis.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The instructional strategies for ELL-SWDs and Long Term ELLs are similar.  Support for these students is provided through high  quality differentiated instruction and ELL English course for students who still exhibit second language errors.  High quality  differentiated instruction techniques grant ELLs access to grade level appropriate material. There are many possible reasons  why students remain in ELL beyond an expected time line.  The language acquisition process takes longer for some students, or  there are significant gaps in the student’s education that have negatively impacted literacy.  There is also a class for ELL-SWDs  that incorporates technology and ENL.  This class provides academic content, English language development, and grade-level  materials. In order to make sure that every ELL-SWD's receive all mandated services required on their IEPs the ELL Coordinator,  Special Education Coordinator, Speech provider, and guidance counselor all sit together to create student schedules and make  sure all services are being provided.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  All ELL-SWDs are scheduled through an alternating schedule where each day includes their mandated hours as per their  proficiency ratings as measured by the NYSESLAT and their years as a ELL as identified in ATS.  Our ELL coordinator and Special  Education coordinator will meet on a regular basis to discuss any matter that needs to be address. Our ELL teacher is also a  part of the IEP team and participates in the IEP process. Through these meetings the team helps our ELL-SWDs achieve their  IEP goals and attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.    Our school uses data from the mandated ELA and Math assessments as well as the mandated ELL assessments (NYSITELL, LAB- R, and NYSESLAT) as well as City assessments (MOSL) to guide instruction for ELLs within the response to intervention  framework for all subject areas. We provide intensive, targeted instruction designed to match our ELLs needs and performance  on administered assessment. Our school uses all three tiers of instructional support. All staff members are involved with the  development of ELL servicing as it is part of differentiation instruction. Specific ELL students receive extra attention, activities,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      and targeted work in addition to core instruction. Intensive and individualized instruction is also offered to our ELLs. Most of  our population receive rigorous and evidence-based curriculum within the classroom.  While using the RtI model and focusing  on our 0-3 year ELL students we look at the ELL’s background and educational contexts, which include first and second  language proficiency, educational history, immigration pattern, and culture. All these things have a huge impact on their  academic achievement in the classroom.  Also we examine the appropriateness of classroom instruction and the classroom  context, gather information through informal and formal assessments, an interpretation of all assessment data. Each of our  targeted interventions program focus on supporting ELL students and ensuring their growth in literacy as well as across the  content areas. All intervention programs are offered to our ELL students in the English language.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on data and trends, we are planning to restructure the ENL teacher curriculum to focus on direct instruction and  NLA support to improve ELLs Language acquisition. We are also partnering up with NYJTL as a CBO to develop an after school  program to provide targeted instruction and tutoring for our ELLs. This  after school program will run every day of the school  week from 2:40-5:30 pm.  Our ELLs are able to attend an after school tutoring program that is offered by specific teachers in all  subject areas. These tutoring sessions are opened to the entire school but can provide the ELL student with additional support  from teachers and peers.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N\A      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Every program that is at our school is offered to every student that attends. This year our school has a after school program  provided by the NYJTL. The NYJTL after school program will offer academic intervention tutorials as well as sports, arts, and  enrichment classes. The program is after school Monday through Friday, beginning at 2:40 p.m and ends at 5:30 pm. Also  during the school day Harvard tutors come into the ELA classes and pull groups of 4 students and works on strategic reading  strategies, book clubs, and\or guided reading groups.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Some of the instructional materials that are used to support ELL students in the classroom are: bilingual dictionaries, iPads  with ELL apps (native language and English), reading journal, content journals, picture dictionaries, leveled books (Spanish \  English), brain pop, homework and classroom in native language, grouping, and peer work.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?    Native language support is delivered in ENL twenty five percent of the time. The ELL coordinator creates a spread sheet with  all ELL students, proficiency results, mandated number of minutes per day and the percent for native language use and  supports.  The native language support is delivered in a number of ways.  Some ways are bilingual dictionaries, iPads with apps  that use their native language and English, picture dictionaries, peer work, grouping, and homework \ classwork in their native  language.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.     Depending on the ELLs age and grade level the required support and resources varies. The materials used are always age and  grade level appropriate for the student.  Based on the NYSESLAT scores and the proficiency levels of the students, the ELL  resources and support changes.  An entering ELL student receives more support and resources than an advance ELL student.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Some of the instructional materials that are used to support ELL students in the classroom are: bilingual dictionaries, iPads  with ELL apps (native language and English), reading journal, content journals, picture dictionaries, leveled books (Spanish \  English), brain pop, homework and classroom in native language, grouping, and peer work.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    For our newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school year we have a NYJTL Program, Building Educated  Leaders for Life. This program connects new students to the environment of our school, allows the students to get introduced  to fellow classmates as well as teachers.  The program runs from 8:20-3:00 pm Monday-Friday. The student receives academic  support in the morning and participates in enrichment activities in the afternoon. New ELLs who enroll throughout the school  year have the opportunity to join our afterschool program. This program, just like our NYJTL program, has academic support as  well as enrichment activities. This after school, NYJTL program, runs from 3:00 pm – 5:00 pm, Monday – Friday.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N\A      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N\A       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The following professional development and support will be available to all staff members this school year.  1. DOE sponsored professional development.  2. i-Ready training   3. Understanding Data to guide instructional Planning for ELLs  4. Understanding the learning needs of ELLs and SWD  5.  Evidence-based instructional strategies to support ELLs   During assigned Monday collaboration sessions, staff members meet with our school counselor, ENL provider to  discuss how  to integrate lessons with relevant and meaningful positive experiences in alignment with Common Core Learning Standards.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our school organizes and facilitates professional  development that to all teachers and administrators that are in directly  involved in addressing the needs of ELLs. These PD are focused on developing and supporting language acquisition  in ELLs,  understanding the academic needs of ELLs,  implementation of best practices for co-teaching strategies and the integration of  language and content instruction for ELLs. Some of these PD, will be facilitated by the ELA and Math Peer Collaborative  Teachers.   The majority of ELL professional development outside of school is attended by the ENL provider and then brought  back to school and turn keyed at the school to the remainder of the staff.  Some of the school wide PD’s  topics will include but  are not limited to: ELL language strategies, differentiation, CTT models, integrated ENL, stand-alone ENL, curriculum planning,  etc.  PDs can be run by in house staff or by an outside agency \ borough field support center.  Teachers are assigned common  preparation periods to review, discuss student data and collaborate in designing and adjusting effective instruction for ELLs. In  addition we have several staff members attending professional development outside of the school building. These meetings   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         are ongoing throughout the year and are divided between a number of our teachers across all grades and content areas.  We  also are supported by our borough field support center who will work with our staff to outline strategies for our ELL students  to get support in areas other than ELA, specifically in content area classroom.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our school provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language development  progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. These annual  individual meetings will take place on Tuesday after school during the parent contact time.  These meetings will be scheduled  and phone calls and letters will be distributed. During these meetings if interpretation and translation is needed proper steps  will be taken ahead of time. Our parent coordinator will be used for Spanish speaking translation and a fellow staff member  will be used for our French speaking student.     Answer for # 2: Records will be kept for annual individual meetings with ELL parents as well as outreach to ensure parent  needs are accommodated. A spread sheet is created by the ELL coordinator that will be used to keep track of all outreach and  meetings. The spread sheet will include the student, proficiency level, ID number, Parent contact, when the meeting was  scheduled, as well as the different measure of outreach needed. For each meeting an agenda will be created with signatures  from everyone that attends.  If a parent doesn’t attend the meeting either the parent coordinator or ELL coordinator will reach  out and schedule another meeting time. If a parent cannot come in then a phone conference will be scheduled.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Our school has a variety of activities to ensure parental involvement in the education process.  Parents are continually notified  of the on goings of school events through mailing and phone contact, in their native language whenever possible.  We have a  parent coordinator who is the first line of communication between our parents and out school. We offer PDs and resources for  all parents of all students. We are continually re-evaluating the needs of our parents and their children through surveys,  meetings and face to face communication.  We also offer school wide functions including dances, festivals and other  community based functions that provide not only educational opportunities but also offer an inviting atmosphere for parents,  students, and educators to engage in conversations and activities outside of the academic environment.             Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Sayi Neufeld, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Frederick Douglass Academy V                                                                              School DBN: 12x273  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Upon registration non-English speaking parents are provided with a Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) in  their native language. This document provides the school with data to further assist parents and students in our  school community. The data taken from the HLIS is reviewed by the ENL coordinator to determine if the student is  eligible for NYSITELL and LAB R testing and if they are entitled to receive support services. Within the child's first  ten days of school parents are notified (through DOE standardized letters in their native language) whether their  child has been identified as a student who is eligible for support services. From this point, ENL coordinator along  with the parent coordinator follows the DOE mandated process of holding an orientation meeting and describing  entitled services. From that point, parents \ guardians receive reports throughout the year (in home language)  informing them about continuation of services \ testing-out and their child's proficiency level. Any language not  supported by the DOE is translated using the DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit. This method is also used for  translation assessments not supported under the DOEs current language interpreation. Continued collection of  data informs the school of those parents\guardians who are in need of written translation and oral interpretation.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      Another way to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written and oral communication is  to use ATS reports, RAPL, as well as information that is put on the student emergency contact cards and teacher  collected parent information sheets.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    The parents' preferred  languages for both written  and oral communication in  or school are Spanish,  English, French, Twi,  Garifuna, Arabic and  Bengali.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu).

Meeting Name    Month/Frequency of Meetings    How does your school plan to provide   interpretation service(s)?       The formal face-to-face meetings our  school will typically have with parents  throughout the school year are:      - parent-teacher conferences (3 times  a year)   -meet the teacher night (September)   -Case Conferences (scheduled every  Monday and Friday during lunch  periods)   - 8 th grade Graduation meeting  (April)   - IEP meetings ( initial and yearly)   - ENL Identification process (when a  new student is enrolled)   -conflict resolution meetings (all year)   -Open House      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67           3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.               Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.                Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      In September FDA V parents \ guardians are notified of their rights to translation services. Additionally, the ENL  teacher notifies the families of whenever possible the availability of translation services in our school. According to  the Regulations: FDA V will determine within 10 days of a student's enrollment, the primary language spoken by the  parent \ guardian of each student enrolled in the school. Information will be maintained in ATS and on student  Emergency Cards. Our school will provide translation and interpretation services to parents who require language  assistance in order to communicate effectively with the department. Parents \ guardians may rely on a adult or  relative for language interpretation if they choose. Our school will assess timely provision of translated documents  through existing resources or the T & I Unit. Our school will be responsible for providing parents whose primary  language is a covered language and who requires assistance services with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and  Responsibilities which includes their rights regarding translation and interpretation services. Our school will post signs  in the parent coordinators office displaying information in the most prominent covered languages indicating  availability of interpretation services. The school safety plan will contain procedures for ensuring that parents in need  of language assistance are not prevented from reaching school administrative offices due to language barriers. Our  school strategies support shared parent-school accountability, parent access to information about their children's  educational options and parents' capacity to improve their children's achievement.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Our school will use a number of ways to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services. One  way is through the parent survery, as well as a survey that will be given during meet the teacher night and during  parent teacher conferences. Another way our school will gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         of services will be during ENL annual parent meetings.
