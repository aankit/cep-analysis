This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Renaissance High School (RHS) believes that to best support students we must create a safe, collaborative  environment in which students, staff and parents can come together to advance our school community. As such, our  Mission Statement is: "Renaissance High School is dedicated to empowering our students through relevant,  respectful, and innovative practices, which ensure their academic and social success in our community and beyond."  Additionally, our Theory of Action is: “We devote significant time and resources to assist in the development of the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      capacities of our teacher leaders in order to facilitate ongoing improvement in instruction. This process ensures the  focus of our teachers’ collaborative work will be on increasing student knowledge.”          2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    As of June 2018, Renaissance High School serves 454 students in grades 9 through 12. Our student body is 58.4%  female and 41.6% percent male and the ethnic majorities are 63% Hispanic and 26% black populations, with 25% of  students requiring an IEP.   Renaissance is entering year three of a partnership with the College Bound Initiative. This partnership has been able  to enhance the supports students and families receive in the college search and application process. The CBI helps  students and their guardians navigate the SAT/ACT registration process, college trip and visits for students and their  parents, as well as the financial aid application process. CBI has yielded positive results in engaging seniors and their  families in the college application process. As a result: 100% of seniors met with the college counsellor, 76% Applied  to CUNY Colleges, 55% Applied to schools other than CUNY, 62% completed their FAFSA, 86% Registered for the SAT.  The foundations for a college going culture within the class of 2018 has already been established as evidenced by 76%  of students have already taken the SAT. Additionally, CBI has supplemented the RHS Guidance Department and  allowed counsellors to dedicate time and resources to the previously mentioned social-emotional needs of the  student population.      RHS is continuing and expanding its participation in the PROSE (Progressive Redesign Opportunity for Schools of  Excellence) program for the 2018-2019 school year. Acceptance into the PROSE program was contingent on  demonstrating a history of collaboration, trust, and positive student outcomes in the past. Applications were  reviewed by a joint panel of Department of Education and UFT members. The flexibility created by the PROSE  program will afford RHS administration and staff to innovate, better serving our students with a more efficient  instructional calendar to promote both teacher collaboration and student learning. Specifically, staff professional  learning sessions will be more evenly distributed throughout the week to support a deeper level of implementation  and consistency. Additionally, instructional days will be maximized by holding whole staff PLC sessions on traditionally  low attendance days. RHS believes that PROSE modifications will create flexibility to build on this strength and allow  for stronger collaboration both within our school and between school on the Lehman Educational Campus.      RHS’s administrative Cabinet includes the instructional realm of the Grade and Content Teams, a Master Teacher, a  Model Teacher and a Peer Collaborative Teacher. These stakeholders will each work to support the diverse needs of  the school community. Lab and model classrooms will be established to identify and revise instructional practices. The  ultimate goal of this community effort is to maximize student comprehension and learning while identifying problems  of practice; then targeting solutions and implementing them through a system of Tiered Support for Teachers. The  structure allows for multiple levels of support for teachers of all levels, focusing (but not limited to) the school’s  Professional Learning Goals of  (1) Minimizing Barriers and Maximizing Learning for All Learners (2) Literacy  Development: Reading and Writing for Understanding and (3) Data Informed Instructional Decisions.       Renaissance High School is on a co-located campus with five other schools. Over the past four to five school years  campus schools have collaborated to ensure a safe, strong learning environment for all students. To that end, the  campus has effectively secured improvements in its library services, athletic facilities and shared instruction. Starting  in the 2016-17 school year, schools within the Lehman Campus began to pool resources through an AP For All   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      instructional program. The collaboration will expand access to College Board approved Advanced Placement courses  across the campus. Students will have the opportunity to select from a larger option of courses to support their  individual strengths and interests.      RHS will continue its partnerships with Teaching Matters and the College Bound Initiative providing key resources and  opportunities. Teaching Matters provides teacher support and works with RHS to align vision, set high, attainable  goals for student performance, and establish clear expectations with classroom teachers. RHS has also initiated the  promising practice of “teachers observing teachers.” This provides a learning opportunity, especially to the younger,  less experienced teachers, who can then turnkey and model what they have learned and observed in their own  classrooms. They attend planning and assessment meetings and work collaboratively with us to establish new  classroom and scheduling protocols required for programmatic success. Through their means of staff support, teacher  support, relationship management, and program implementation, the needs of our students have been better served.       For the 2018-2019 school year RHS will be known as Renaissance High School for Musical Theater and the Arts. This  name change represents our commitment to provide students with a comprehensive arts education throughout their  four years of high school. When students enter RHS they are able to choose from one of four disciplines in the Arts  field, visual, vocal, theater, or instrumental. Each of these subject areas has courses that range from the beginner  level to advanced; students are able to progress in their coursework as their artistic expertise grows.      A new partnership for the 2018-2019 school year is beginning with the Center for Supportive Schools through their  Peer Group Connection program. Peer Group Connection (PGC) for High Schools is an evidence-based program that  supports and eases students’ successful transition from middle to high school. The program taps into the power of  high school juniors and seniors to create a nurturing environment for incoming freshmen. Once per week, pairs of  junior and senior peer leaders meet with groups of 10-14 freshmen in outreach sessions designed to strengthen  relationships among students across grades. These peer leaders are simultaneously enrolled in a daily, for-credit,  year-long leadership course taught by school faculty during regular school hours.      RHS is entering year ten as an Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) school. The AVID program trains  teachers to implement proven, effective instructional strategies. The program believes that teachers are inherently  passionate about education. AVID helps teachers shift from delivering content to facilitating learning, resulting in an  inquiry-based, student-centric classroom. These elements are at the core of our approach to closing the opportunity  gap. Schools today include students of diverse cultures, languages, and backgrounds, AVID helps teachers relate to all  students. AVID teachers know that all students are capable, often challenging many core beliefs. Teachers have the  flexibility to add tools from AVID to augment learning of any subject.   Lastly, RHS was awarded a grant to collaborate with the organization Facing History and Ourselves. Five teachers from  the ELA and history teams will be able to attend summer workshops and receive classroom resources and support. By  integrating the study of history, literature, and human behavior with ethical decision making and innovative teaching  strategies, this program enables secondary school teachers to promote students’ historical understanding, critical  thinking, and social-emotional learning. As students explore the complexities of history, and make connections to  current events, they reflect on the choices they confront today and consider how they can make a difference.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   25% of our students require an IEP. According to the School Performance Dashboard, Renaissance High School  Student body's Economic Need Index (ENI) is 69.6% (compared to a city wide high school ENI of 60.6%). Many of the  students have mental health issues that require a great deal of time and attention on the part of the staff. School  resources are dedicated and made available to these students and their families. A great many of our students and  their families live at or below the poverty level. RHS has 42 students Temporary Housing. Every effort is made by RHS  and its staff to alleviate some of the obstacles to learning which socio-economics factors affect. Leadership has  thoughtfully allocated instructional and support resources to deal with the social-emotional needs of our student  body with thoughtful staffing and partnerships         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   RHS has made the most progress in the elements of Rigorous Instruction and Family Community Ties. During the  2017-2018 school year, each content area has fully implemented an instructional program that is data driven and built  on the state standards. Content teams met at a minimum of three times per week to lesson plan, create assessments,  look at student work, revise curriculum, analyze data and to communicate various student needs. Through these  regular content team meetings teachers are afforded the opportunity to implement professional learning resources  and ensure that instruction is continually improving.   Additionally, through the use of the Kinvolved and PupilPath applications RHS has increased meaningful parent  communication. Parents are notified immediately when their student is late or absent from each class via a text  message. These systems also allow for us to send important information more quickly than traditional mailings. The  Kinvolved system utilizes SMS text messaging to make bidirectional communication seamless.   Moving into the 2018-19 school year, RHS will focus on the Framework for Great Schools element of Supportive  Environment. Our school focus will be to support both teachers and students alike. Specifically, we are going to  expand our teacher support to include a model, master and peer collaborative teacher. These three individuals will  each be responsible for supporting teachers in a variety of ways. In effort to support students we are going to  implement the above mentioned PGC program for all incoming ninth grade students as part of their daily advisory  class.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 08X293   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   465   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     RHS teachers and administration have dedicated significant Professional Development time during the 2017-2018  school year actively exploring the AVID concept of Writing, Inquiry, Collaboration, Organization and Reading (WICOR).  The belief is that increasing pedagogical techniques and options in these areas will allow for common practices across  classrooms that support students ability to work at a high level. As we move to the second year of implementation,  these instructional techniques will be deployed across the school. The skills developed will allowed teachers to  provide students with access to state standards and assessments in a meaningful way. These areas of focus aligned  with each component of Danielson; specifically, teachers need time to work in content area teams to plan for the  implementation of these strategies (component 1). They can then receive feedback and support thought the  implementation phase by administration, team leaders and model teachers. These key stake holders made certain  that there was cohesion and alignment across grades and content areas.    Through these efforts, RHS has seen an 4% increase in our overall graduation rate. Despite this improvement, the  graduation rate of students with an IEP has decreased.   College and career preparedness now demands higher levels of critical thinking, and these skills must be fostered and  scaffolded every day in the classroom, through our implementation of WICOR strategies teachers displayed growth in  planning for and implementing rigorous instruction across classrooms.    College and Career preparedness measurements demand higher levels of critical thinking in which mastery is  frequently demonstrated in writing. RHS introduced Assessment for Learning (AFL) strategies and Write To Learn  (WTL) strategies in Professional Development in order to expand teacher's abilities to create meaningful assessments  that are supplemented by discussion to create accurate assessments and the opportunity for actionable feedback.   As the NYC School Quality Guide Demonstrates, students have succeeded in passing written exams (English and Social  Studies) to progress towards graduation when compared to both Citywide and Comparison Schools. However, RHS  remains focused on building skills so that more graduates are meeting college readiness benchmarks. CCLS focused  skills must be fostered and scaffolded every day in all classrooms. Assessments using both writing and discussion  protocols will be a point of emphasis both within content areas and across grades for the 2018-2019 school year.  Assessing all students while maintaining rigor is an area that RHS will be targeting to improve instruction in all content  areas.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  RHS prides itself in having created a strong school culture that supports both student and teacher growth.  Traditionally, we have had strong results in the area of Supportive Environment. This trend has reversed over the last  school year as evidenced in the student perception surveys distributed in December. On the 2017-2018 NYCDOE  survey RHS scored the lowest under the peer support for academic work section, 8% below the city average and 9%  below the borough average.   Through the Peer Group Connection program RHS seeks to provide students with a support structure created and  reinforced by their peers. This program will give students direct access to fellow students who they can work closely  with to work through their struggles.    To support this program, each 9th grade student will be programmed for an advisory period each day with a teacher  who has extensive advisory experience. 11th and 12th grade students will be programmed into a PGC advisory class  daily that teaches them how to lead groups and direct peer conversations. The 11th and 12th grade students will then  work in pairs to meet with 10-14 9th graders on a weekly basis. In addition to their in person meetings the upper class  students will make follow up meetings and conduct outreach to further support students.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.      Access to a rigorous, standards based curriculum is a critical element in a student’s educational development. As  Common Core implementation deepens teachers must ensure their curriculum is continually adjusted to support  student needs, providing them with access to rigorous coursework. In our last Quality Review (2016 SY) the need for  more rigorous instruction was cited as an area of improvement. Rigorous instruction cannot be achieved without  careful planning and the development of strong units of study. Further, to develop these strong units of study  teachers need to have the opportunity to attend professional learning sessions and to see best practices in action.  Currently, RHS has structures in place that will allow teacher teams to meet on a regular basis to develop and adapt  their units of study.    Curriculum within Renaissance has been making the shift towards CCLS initiated by NYC and NYSED. This has been a  collaborative endeavor. Through Content Lead teachers, RHS has structures in place that allow teacher teams to  develop and reflect upon Units of Study.    Renaissance believes that in effort to increase collaboration among teachers lab and model classrooms need to be  established. RHS will have a model, master and a peer collaborative teacher next school year. These three teachers  will be setting up instructional conversations among colleagues, setting up intervisitations, and fostering professional  conversations among colleagues.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

Teachers in RHS have a variety of experience levels. For the 2017-2018 school year the average teacher MOTP score  was 3.11 based on Advance ratings, with a range of 2.07 - 3.83. Teacher leaders who have been at RHS have been  exposed to instructional Professional Development that newer members of the faculty may not be familiar with.  Instructional strengths and areas for growth also vary among teachers.   While the school's targeted element for improvement in instruction is planning coherent instruction and assessment  for learning, teachers may be starting at different levels of understanding. This presents a challenge when creating a  professional development program and targeting support that is engaging and provides opportunities for teacher  growth for all teachers.    Additionally, typically teachers have visits from a variety of people throughout the school year. Administrators, college  advisors, colleagues and instructional coaches typically visit teachers and provide feedback. It is critical that these  stakeholders are able to communicate with one another and able to clearly align feedback that supports teachers. To  that end, we need to develop a system to track and monitor the feedback that teachers receive.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.      Parent and community involvement are cornerstones to a successful educational program. In viewing the Framework  for Great Schools guide and looking at the 2018-2018 school survey, RHS identified a need to improve family- community ties in an effort to increase parent involvement. Currently, RHS has developed various parent workshops  in consultation with the Parent Association. We have secured grants and partnered with DreamYard and Elevate to  offer parents workshops and engaging activities. The objective is to offer parents the opportunity to explore their  student’s success, curriculum and cultural experiences in an engaging way.       Through our partnership with the College Bound Initiative (CBI) Parents will have the opportunity to engage with the  RHS community more deeply. Specifically, each parent (11th and 12th grade) will be scheduled to meet individually  with the college advisor to discuss students future plans. Workshops will be hosted by CBI to deliver important  information and deadlines to parents. Lastly, parents will have the option of attending college visits with their student  throughout the year.       Additionally, RHS teachers utilize Kinvolved and Skedula/PupilPath platform to communicate grades, attendance and  anecdotal reports to parents about their children. Parents who engage through digital platforms are able to  participate as important partners in their child's academic progress. However, to maximize the effectiveness of this  tool, more parents need to have access to the information by registering and creating accounts.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.   By June 2019, RHS will deepen individualization in our college going culture by strategically using our College Bound  Initiative partner to increase the number of support interactions for college bound seniors from 30% of families to 75%  of families.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  RHS uses a thoughtful hiring practices and support in order to ensure that highly qualified teachers are every  classroom. This year RHS has hired new visual arts and ENL teachers to serve our students. Teacher growth and  professional development are delivered in full staff, department, small group with model teachers, and also across  schools to our LPP Partners.      Candidates are selected after resume submissions through either Open Market, DOE Hiring Events, or partnerships  with Manhattanville College, and Lincoln Center. They are initially interviewed by a committee team consisting of the  content team leader and other teachers of that content. Interview includes participation in a mock department  meeting including a sample Looking at Student Work (LASW) discussion. Recommendations are made to the principal  and the candidate is invited to conduct a demo lesson to demonstrate classroom and content competency. After the  principal has met with the candidate, the interviewing group discusses and makes a finalized decision.      Teachers constantly work within content and within grade teams to support each other and are offered PD  opportunities several times a year. All staff members are treated with respect and are given all the tools needed in  order to conduct and maintain a meaningful classroom experience for our students. Our staff considers each other a  family and works together as a whole to further develop their teaching skills.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Currently, RHS is in year two of our three-year professional development plan. College and career preparedness now  demands higher levels of critical thinking, and these skills must be fostered and scaffolded every day in the classroom,  through highly effective questioning and discussion techniques, in order to increase student success.

Teachers across classrooms will demonstrate improved instruction and access to rigorous curriculum practices as  evidenced by observation/feedback results using the Danielson Framework.       Goal #2: Improved data informed instructional decisions    Increase collaboration between teachers and application of targeted inquiry cycles. Teachers will focus on  application of formative and summative data to maintain rigor and promote student engagement and growth in  targeted areas. Use of data will be evident in classroom observations and department curricula and assessments.       Goal #3: Improve Student Performance: Literacy   Student performance will increase across classrooms as a result of improvements in practice, as evidenced by growth  in both state widestatewide assessments as well as teacher-chosen common assessments that ask students to think  critically and produce meaningful work products using written assessment .      In order to provide meaningful professional development for all teachers, PD goals will be delivered in tiers. Large  concepts will often be delivered to the entire faculty. In order to allow meaningful growth for experienced teachers,  the sessions will be broken into different tiers based on experience. Additionally, departments will implement  concepts within teams. Less experienced teachers will work on a one on one basis with a mentor teacher (RHS has 3  among the faculty) to plan and implement instructional practices outlined in Professional Development Plan as well as  individual observation feedback. On a larger scope, the Learning Partners Program allows RHS to share and  implement best practices between different schools on the Lehman Campus.         Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

Not Applicable        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Renaissance High School uses both formative and summative assessment techniques to improve student learning.  Summative assessments are Common Core aligned and reflect all modifications and updates released by NYS and the  NYCDOE. Each content team creates a uniform regents based assessment for all end of unit, midterm and final exams.  The creation of these exams follows the Backward Design Model as outlined in Wiggins and McTighe’s Understanding  by Design . Exams are created that address and assess the targeted Common Core Standards, and then content teams  build unit maps to attain the desired outcomes.    After assessments are administered, content teams begin the data analysis process. At RHS this process is centered on  the Apperson Datalink computer program. This program allows teachers to perform item analysis, skill analysis,  student progress checks and question analysis quickly and easily. As teacher teams examine this data they determine  gaps in student understanding, misconceptions and areas of growth. This information is then presented to students in  the form of student reflective guides and in-class review of the data. To address the discovered student needs  teachers use a number of techniques including (but not limited to); Do Now reviews, exit/entrance assessments, after  school/Saturday tutoring, and whole class re-teaching. Curricula adjustments are made directly in each unit plan at  the conclusion of the summative assessment given by the content team.   To address day-to-day student needs and assess student understanding on a smaller time scale, RHS teachers use a  variety of formative assessment, specifically Assessment for Learning (AfL)techniques. Content team leaders received  training in Af, the Lead Teacher and administration through years of professional development and pilot program  work. AfL techniques have been built directly into our professional development plan for the last five years. The  techniques are scaffolded and differentiated based on teacher and team needs (i.e. clear learning objectives, What I  am Looking For (WILF), entrance/exit tickets, think pair share, popsicle sticks, fish bowls, etc.). Cycles of professional  development in 2017-18 included introducing WICOR strategies to teachers across all classrooms. In addition to these  techniques, teacher content teams participate in a Looking at Student Work Protocol twice monthly. Through this  process teachers are able to diagnose student misconceptions dealing with content, strengths and weaknesses  dealing with key academic skills as well as evaluate the quality of tasks being completed in classrooms.     This combination of formative and summative assessment techniques has provided teacher teams and administration  with necessary information to ensure curriculum alignment. These processes have certainly improved our teaching  practice and have translated into student improvement. Students have become more accountable for their work,  more knowledgeable about the assessment process and more reflective on their roles as learners.   Teacher voice is included in the decision making process for RHS. All voices are included in assessment development  and selection. Departments develop and reflect on unit assessments as a team.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)     1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43        Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Renaissance High School in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A  of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Renaissance High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.        In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Through  research and discussions the students will have the opportunity to further develop academic  language. Interaction with various communities will provide varied opportunities for language  development within different socio-cultural contexts.  The Intercultural Volunteering Club will target ELL and bilingual students grades 9-12.  Interaction between ELL students and bilingual students will provide opportunities for  development in English language and the Home language.  Current and former ELL students will  be able to participate and receive support from the ENL teacher.  The Club will meet weekly after school, and as needed based on current community project.  The language of instruction will be English by one teacher certified in ENL instruction.  The materials used will include the WIDA MODEL (Measure of Developing English Language),  the WIDA Amplification of the English Language Development Standards,  chromebooks, ipads,  and desktop computers.  WIDA identified features of academic language development using a  framework for communicating and learning within socio-cultural contexts. The interaction  between different people for specific purposes and across different learning environments  influence how language is used.

We will partner with  DreamYard to offer a series of family engagement workshops.  We propose to offer a series of three family arts workshops, including a community arts  celebration event. Through these sessions, parents and children will work together to participate  in hands-on projects that are related to the work children are doing through the existing  DreamYard arts residencies. Parents and students will have options in the creation of artwork  produced during the workshops will be shared in the school as part of the community arts  celebration, along with other work students created through the existing residencies and within  Visual Arts Courses. The multiple options of mediums provided by DY Arts Partner create  opportunities for Families to engage in all or individual parts of the arts workshop series. To  support the Blueprint for the Arts, instruction will focus on participants creating high-quality  pieces using a variety of techniques and materials. They will analyze and discuss examples of art  for inspiration, use art form-specific vocabulary to discuss their work, offer feedback to their  peers, and explain their process. Participants will make connections between their own work, the  pieces they have examined for inspiration, and the greater social and historical contexts in which  their work exists. Because the projects families engage with during the workshops are connected  to those students are working on in the arts integrated residencies, the program will also help  parents to understand each grade’s curriculum and how the arts are supporting it. We will also  collect documentation in the form of photos and quotes/ testimonials from students, parents and  school staff, which will be shared with the school community.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Formative and curriculum based assessments are used to assess the linguistic and content knowledge of the ENL students. The  language assessments will look at all modalities; listening, speaking, reading and writing. For this purpose, we use the  NYSESLAT and NYSITELL performance as a starting point and for diagnostic purposes. In addition, teacher created  performance-based assessments embedded in the curriculum are used. These include oral reports, demonstrations, written  assignments and portfolios as well as scoring rubrics and observation checklists for progress monitoring.  With regards to specific content area knowledge of ENL students, the ENL teacher and the content area teacher who are  engaged in a co-teaching relationship, will use  assessments which will focus on the ENL student’s grade level content  knowledge. These include pre-assessments in the Home Language, and curriculum based scaffolded assessments in the form  of projects, drawings, and graphic organizers. The language and content area assessment results will drive the instruction  throughout the academic year.  Quantitative data gathered include, but are not limited to, the student’s language proficiency levels, home language   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      proficiency levels, the years in the program, and their ELA state test scores. Qualitative data gathered from the students  include, but are not limited to, students’ backgrounds and cultures, including identifying their home or heritage languages, the  students’ linguistic experiences, passions and interests, strengths as learners, and specific academic needs (either from  student interviews or IEP’s, where applicable). The quantitative data can show whether that the ELL population is lagging  behind in success at ELA state testing. The qualitative data can show the interest and strengths the ELL students have which  may impact their language proficiency development.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The structures in place to support the ENL students in their achievement of language proficiency in all modalities include  school wide programs as well as ENL focused programs. At a school level, RHS has a Literacy Action Plan which focuses on the  development and enhancement of literacy strategies in the classroom. The ENL focused structures include using culturally  relevant material, differentiated data-driven instruction focused on all modalities, using a variety of ENL centered strategies,  use of the Home Language where necessary, scaffolding techniques and informal assessments and observations.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We will evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs by examining the data from our DYO periodic assessments, NYSESLAT,  and Regents exams. The data should indicate improved reading and writing proficiency scores for ELL students, an increase in  the number of ELL students advancing to the next proficiency level, the number of ELLs on track in terms of credit  accumulation, and an increase in the number of ELLs earning 65% or higher in the Regents exams.  Areas of need identified  include reading and writing.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been reviewed, students who are identified as needing additional support are referred to small  group instruction both within the classroom (both ENL and content area instruction) as well as through in-school tutoring. The  small group instruction is differentiated and targeted to address the specific needs identified through the data. The students  continue to be assessed informally through in class tests, student-teacher conferences, and teacher observations.  The  students move in and out of this support structure as needed to address their particular needs. If this additional support is not  enough then the student(s) will be considered for more individualized supports outside of the classroom.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A  :        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Outcome assessments include the NYSESLAT  Regents scores as well as in-class summative assessments. The evaluations will  inform on any patterns in the students' achievements of language acquisition and performance. This information will guide  program adjustments individually for students and at the grade level. The 2017 NYSESLAT scores data showed that for the  incoming ninth graders, 86% tested Expanding, less than 1% tested Transitioning and Commanding and none were Entering or  Emerging. For the tenth graders, 42% tested in each of the Expanding and Commanding levels, less than 1% tested  Transitioning and none were Entering or Emerging levels. For the eleventh graders, 67% tested Expanding, while less than 1%  tested in each of the Emerging and Commanding levels and none in the Transitioning or Entering levels. Finally, 100% of the  twelfth graders tested in the Commanding level and none for the Entering, Emerging, Transition or Expanding levels.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The school has several structures in place to facilitate the work within content areas and between content areas. Team Leaders  are involved in Whole Staff Professional Development which present an opportunity to roll out specific strategies to address  ENL program adjustments in all content areas. In addition, Content Team meetings present opportunities to address specific  areas of strength and development for ENL students. Finally, grade team meetings allow teachers, parent coordinators, and  social workers to address ENL student performance problems at each grade level.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.

Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The English language instruction is delivered in a Freestanding English as a New Language program. ENL students are  programmed per CR 154 to meet the required ENL instructional minutes. Depending on the students’ proficiency  levels, ENL programming will include Standalone ENL instruction and/or integrated content area instruction.

Students  are placed in heterogeneous groups, and instruction is delivered utilizing a sheltered instruction method. This method focuses   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      on making content comprehensible and accessible to ELL students through scaffolding and differentiation strategies. Home  Language support is provided through the use of bilingual glossaries, dictionaries and translated materials where possible and  appropriate. Also, students are permitted to provide translation assistance to each other when needed. To support these  classes, the ENL teachers implement strategies for scaffolds or differentiation and alternative means of assessment.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELLs are evaluated in their Home Language at intake. Spanish-speaking newcomers receive the Spanish version of the LAB to  assess their Spanish proficiency. Our LOTE teacher assesses the Home Language proficiency of our incoming 9th graders and  our new admits whose first language is Spanish with a DYO diagnostic exam. We seek to develop a proficiency exam for our  minority language groups, such as Bengali or Albanian, in conjunction with community based organizations and the City's  Translation Unit.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Instruction is designed to meet the needs of all proficiency classifications: SIFE, Newcomers, Long Term     ELLs and Former ELLs. Instructional materials in all content areas are in the two predominant languages (Spanish and English),  dictionaries and glossaries are available and, when needed, audio and video materials are provided. Technology is integrated  into daily lessons through the use of SMART boards and software on laptop computers. Also, after school activities  and tutoring sessions are offered to all ELLs.      A. Students who are identified as SIFE are programmed for sheltered instruction classes in order to provide individualized  attention. Sheltered instruction is modified so that the subject matter is more comprehensible to students with limited  vocabularies. Sheltered instruction strategies include the increased use of visuals, collaborative learning activities, and  demonstrations. In these classes, the teachers cover the most important information in a way that is accessible, culturally  relevant, and age-appropriate. SIFE students also receive explicit instruction in an age-appropriate manner of reading in a  literacy-rich environment. SIFE students are assessed in various forms so as to accurately ascertain their content  knowledge. SIFE students are also encouraged to participate in after school tutoring designed to support them in their content  area classes.     B. Newcomers are engaged in challenging theme-based curriculum and grade level content instruction which builds vocabulary  and academic concepts. Also, the culture, Home Language, and background knowledge of the students are central to the  instructional units. Differentiation at this level of proficiency will include building the ELLs background knowledge on the  content area, extensive academic vocabulary instruction, pre-taught sentence frames and cloze paragraphs, partner work,  realia, and teacher-led small group instruction. These activities are set up to build students' academic English proficiency  through scaffolded instruction.      C. For Developing ELLs, the work is more rigorous and scaffolds are fewer and more individualized. Higher expectations are  placed in these students to ensure their performance in the general education classes is successful. Students are engaged in  leveled reading and writing activities closer to their grade-level counterparts, with close attention to the acquisition of Tier II  academic language. Teacher modeling and graphic organizers are used along with word banks, sentence and paragraph frames  to produce written material.  After school tutoring is available to these students to receive additional help with their content  area classes.      D. Long Term ELL instruction focuses on explicit language and literacy instruction. Culturally relevant and grade level content is  used for instruction focused on the acquisition of academic language, phonetic awareness, reading and writing strategies, and  organization skills. Long Term ELLs are also encouraged to use metacognition strategies to expand their literacy levels. After  school tutoring is available to these students to receive additional help with their content area classes.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         E. Former ELL students are immersed in general education curriculum that supports their growth in academic language and  content. These students are exposed to language and vocabulary that continues to accelerate their growth. Students are  afforded opportunities to receive individualized support from the ENL and content area teacher before/after school.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELLs who are also classified as students with disabilities are programmed according to their proficiency levels and their IEPs.  Our special education and ENL teachers regularly review student academic performance and provide the necessary  intervention services. In addition, the teachers holds conferences, by phone or in person, to communicate these needs to our  students' families. All of our ELL students are treated as individuals, regardless of NYSESLAT scores or special learning needs.  We program students and offer services depending on individual student needs. Several after school programs not only offer  Regents preparation and credit accumulation, but also offer students the opportunity to refine their skills and build  capacity.          7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  All students will be included as to not single any student out. The school provides a selection of academic courses as well as  electives courses that meet the academic and language needs of the ELL-SWD students. These courses are with the general  education population and provide integrated co-teaching supports where needed.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The performance of ELLs is closely monitored in ELA, math, history, and science via case conferences, team and grade meetings  and analysis of data. The school implements several programs that support the ELL population performance in the core  content area courses including the Literacy Action Plan, writing workshops, tutoring, one-to-one individualized support plans,  small group instruction within the classes and teacher collaboration between departments.  ELA: Literacy Action Plan, writing workshops, tutoring, one-to-one individualized support plans, small group instruction for  Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding levels. Intervention services are provided in English.     Math: Literacy Action Plan, tutoring, one-to-one individualized support plans, for Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding  and Commanding levels. Intervention services are provided in English.  Science: Literacy Action Plan, tutoring, one-to-one individualized support plans for Entering, Emerging, Transitioning,  Expanding and Commanding levels. Intervention services are provided in English.  Social Studies: Literacy Action Plan, writing workshops, tutoring, one-to-one individualized support plans, small group  instruction for Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding levels. Intervention services are provided in  English.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Our school will seek to provide further Home Language support for the students. In particular, Spanish speakers could receive  Home Language literacy instruction from the Spanish foreign language teacher. Additional supports can be provided through  an elective literacy class.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   At present, no programs/services are being discontinued.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs. Students can participate in all extra-curricular activities and tutoring.  Tutoring is provided for all major subject areas. ELLs are encouraged to attend these after school sessions. In addition, some  ELLs are participating in the Lincoln Center Institute partnership that creates avenues for exposure and appreciation in the arts.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      Twice a week, after school tutoring is provided specifically for our ELLs. During tutoring, students are provided with skills,  strategies, or additional time to complete assignments for ESL and other content area classes.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   A variety of instructional materials are used to support the ELL population. Technology is utilized with all ELL classes through  the use of SMART boards, Google Classroom, NewsELA, and Quizlet. In addition, the students use language and literacy  software. To support the students' Home Languages in ENL and in content areas, bilingual dictionaries, glossaries and  translating pens are also made available. Students have access to computers to use Google Translate or other web-based  translator programs. When available, books on CD and textbooks in the native language are provided.           13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Currently, the only model our school provides for English acquisition is the Freestanding ENL program. During scheduled  periods for all proficiency levels,Home Language support is provided through the availability of bilingual dictionaries and  glossaries. For Spanish speakers, the LOTE teacher provides Home Language instruction. Depending on availability, native  language texts are a part of our classroom library. Furthermore, students are permitted  to communicate in their Home  Language with their peers when translation is needed. The students receive a copy of the Regents in English and in their HL  except for the ELA Regents.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.     At our school, required support and resources correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels. First, students are placed in classes  for ENL. As in most high schools, students receive their daily content-area instruction based on credit accumulation. Literature,  textbooks, and computer-based resources are all targeted to our ELLs interest, age and grade level. Instruction during ENL  classes is often differentiated based on the language instruction needs of the students.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     A variety of instructional materials are used to support the ELL population. Through our campus, schools have supported each  other by sharing materials such as text books and literature books. In addition, the schools have supported each other with  programming where necessary.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    Currently there are not any activities in our school to assist newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school  year. However, students are invited to attend Bridge Program, Fordham University, College Now, Lincoln Center, AVID and  other programs that are offered to all RHS students.           17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish is offered as a language elective for ELLs. In addition, some students have taken the Spanish language LOTE exam.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62     N/A           Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   The pedagogical and administrative staff, through PD, will learn specific strategies to use in the classroom that targets specific  areas of need for ELL students. In addition, most RHS teachers take part in content team planning for one full period per day.  During this time, content area teachers engage in case-conferencing, through which they share strategies that work with  various students. Per the UFT contract, the faculty will meet twice monthly. Conference time is used for presentations from  faculty members about how to better serve our students, including those students who receive language support. Similarly,  the staff have also initiated a series of lunch and learns with the rest of the faculty to sustain the dialogue about how to best  meet the needs of all our students.   ELL teachers regularly attend Professional Development courses from the Office of English Language Learners and the District  Field Support Liaison, among others. The professional development courses range from strategies for instruction, to NYSESLAT  preparation, as well as NYSESLAT testing among others.                  2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Strategies used, not not limited to, include:  - Differentiated instruction based on students' ability, proficiency levels and learning styles  - Quality Teaching for English Learners  - Use of Point of Entry Model/ Balanced Literacy  - Varied learning modalities  - Ongoing assessments  Varied assessment tools  - Assessment for Learning Strategies  - Scaffolding instruction across all content areas     To assist ELLs as they transition from middle school to high school, we provide staff with professional development to help  them analyze the NYSESLAT scores and the State ELA and mathematics assessments to determine how to best address the  needs of these incoming students. In addition, in content area teams, the staff will conduct a gap analysis of the reading and  writing demands between middle school and high school, and what instruction will best bridge the gap for our incoming ELLs.    Monthly ELL training for all staff is introduced to understand and analyze the NYSESLAT scores. Since our ELLs receive content- area instruction in general education classes, the staff is presented with best practices for ELLs in their content areas. Topics to  be delivered are:  -  Literacy Across the Curriculum  - Technology Resources that support literacy  - computer-based reading programs- SRI  - using SQR3  - teachers and writers collaborative: strategies for writing  - methods for fair assessment  - strategies and scaffolds for content-area classes  - understanding the NYSESLAT performance levels   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         - the use of the SMART board  and technology for language learning    ELL teachers regularly attend Professional Development courses to meet the required 50% ELL-Specific professional  development requirement. The courses are organized by from the Office of English Language Learners and the District Field  Support Liaison, among others. The professional development courses range from strategies for instruction, to NYSESLAT  preparation, as well as NYSESLAT testing among others.               Records are maintained through the collection of attendance, which are kept on file with the ENL coordinator. Copies of the  PowerPoint slide presentations are kept online in Google Docs. Hard copies of these presentations are also kept on file with  the ENL coordinator.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   We encourage participation of all parents for all school activities, which include but are not limited to:  - Parent engagement on a weekly basis, where needed.  - annual winter concert  - annual spring concert  - annual musical theater performance  - multicultural food festival  - how to deal with your teenage workshop  - understanding HS requirements workshop  - getting ready for the college process workshop  - applying for scholarships workshop  During all parent functions translation services are available and all correspondences are sent home in Spanish as well.   The parents of ELLs are provided with materials in English and their HL which explain the goals of the program, the language  development progress of their children, language proficiency assessment results for the past year, and language development  needs in various content areas during meetings or phone conferences. The materials are explained, and any questions are  answered.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Our parent coordinator surveys parents needs at the start of the school year by giving a Workshop Survey. During the course  of the year we try to support the parents' expressed needs and interests from the survey results. Additionally, parents receive  a survey for their preferred language of communication. This assists the parent coordinator in determining which languages  that correspondences from the school need to be translated. Additionally, all events and parent workshops are listed on our  school's website and includes a translator tab to translate the website into other languages. ELL parents are involved in our  school through the Parent Association and individual conferences, where needed. Activities that foster ELL parent involvement  include annual musical theater performance, the annual winter and spring concerts, the multicultural food festival, and the  getting ready for the college process workshop.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Maria N Herrera, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Renaissance HS                                                                              School DBN: 08x293  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      To identify the preferred language of each parent, RHS counselors, parent coordinators, a community associate,  and administrators speak with parents both in person and on the phone when students first enter high school.  Specifically, multiple open house sessions are held for incoming 9th grade students, students newly enrolled are  interviewed with their parents and those that are not met in person are contacted via a telephone call. In these  initial conversations/meetings the parent/guardian is asked what language they prefer to be communicated in.  Additionally, blue cards and the HLIS are regularly reviewed to ensure that all parents needs are met.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68     2.
