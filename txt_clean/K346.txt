This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   P.S. 346 is a community of learners in which children from pre-k through 5th grade participate in a joyful and  challenging education. In our creative environment, children become confident and knowledgeable about themselves  and others. We prepare our children to become successful, compassionate, and self-motivated learners through a  combination of academics, ambiance, and diversity.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Abe Stark Primary School 346 is an elementary school with 590 students from pre-kindergarten through grade 5. The  school population is comprised of 62% African American, 23% Hispanic, 6% White and 6% Asian students, 2%  American Indian and 1% Multiracial. Boys account for 52% of the students enrolled and girls account for 48%. The  annual school attendance rate is 93%.      The school has selected the Teachers College Readers and Writers Project in conjunction with ReadyGen non-fiction  and EngageNY materials to cognitively engage students and set them on a path towards college and career readiness.  The P.S. 346 Instructional Focus is that all stakeholders will engage in a coordinated whole school effort to become  critical thinkers and problem solvers. Learners will demonstrate the ability to question, self-reflect, and articulate  their learning through a set of shared practices in reading, writing, listening and speaking . Curricula development and  planning units of study are a large part of the work of teacher teams across the grades. Teachers began the year  deepening their understanding of Danielson’s framework which guides their ongoing professional development goals.  Through data analysis and deconstruction of student work products, teachers refine curriculum making changes so  units and lesson plans are altered for all students to have access to content and skill development. We are continually  building instructional coherence which promotes college and career readiness for all students.       In the area of SWDs there is a need to improve our Problem of Practice: Implementing SDI (Specifically Designed  Instruction) to drive instruction of IEP students; driven by goals and needs. This includes adding SDI plans in IEPs to  address students goals so that all SWD students will meet at least 100% of his/her goals in ELA and/or Math through  SDI, utilizing school assessments including Fountas and Pinnell Running Records, Teacher’s College Writing Rubrics  across the writing genre, Math CCLS achievement goals and progress reports in SESIS. .      Across grades teachers meet three periods per week to refine curricula using student data to discuss implications for  instruction and curriculum modifications to meet the needs of all students. Teachers are thoughtfully creating units of  study by analyzing data and student work samples so that tasks are strategically aligned to CCLS and embed the  instructional shifts to support all students in developing higher order thinking skills. When looking at student work,  teachers refine their lessons to increase the use of more academic vocabulary instruction to enhance student to  student conversations and written assignments. Additionally, teachers have revised the literacy block to include a  period of guided reading, literacy centers and independent reading to ensure all students, including English language  learners and students with disabilities, are reading independently and have the skills and strategies to access and be  engaged in critical analysis of text. Curricula and academic tasks are planned and refined to meet the needs of all  learners in each classroom.       The Instructional Focus of PS 346 and the shared understanding across the school can be seen in various ways: Shared  expectation that each student has the ability to take ownership of his or her questioning and discussion. Professional  development support around questioning and discussion embedded in inquiry teams throughout the year.  Professional collaboration, including reflecting on student performance and teachers practice to monitor work around  questioning and discussion. Student discussions in the classroom and resulting work displayed throughout the school.    *Our school has 2 SBO’s: The Starrett City After-school program and the Italian American League After-school  program. Both programs support parents and students by assisting with homework and offering arts, crafts, dance,  and physical education activities.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      *Our 4th graders are provided swimming instruction each winter and spring.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 346, in compliance with the Every Student Success Act (ESSA), is  responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of  student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed  by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are  encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee  as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 346 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use ongoing assessments and collection of student data to assess early literacy skills. This year we are using Fundations  Test to assess the early literacy skills of all students in Grades K-1. We are also using Fountas and Pinnell benchmark to assess  our students in kindergarten through grade 5. Additionally, we are using customized, differentiated assessments based on  Teachers College Curriculum.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Data analysis through weekly Inquiry, grade meetings and common planning sessions informs the success of our Ell program.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The performance of the Ell students during the afformentioned formative and summative assessments is analyzed during  Inquiry , grade meetings and common planning periods by the teachers across the grades. Based on data analysis, students are  recommended by their teachers for academic intervention during the instructional day and extended day ( 50 minutes  additional instruction) .Consequently , differentiated, flexible groups are created fof Rti implementation.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    Although ELLs are making steady gains on the NYSESLAT, the data shows that across programs (General Ed, Sp.Ed. SetSS) and  grade levels reading and wrirting is where most students are having the most difficulties. This correltes with research findings  which indicate that cognitive skills in language acquisition take longer to acquire. Addressing the CCS and rigorous texts, our  academic intervention is mainly focused on reading and writing. In the listening and speaking modalities Ell students scored at  advanced or proficient levels, therefore less instructional support is needed in these areas. The majority of our Ells at the  beginning level are newcomers across the grades. In addition, ELL students in Special Education are mostly at beginner and  intermediate levels. NYSESLAT scores indicate that many of these ELL students with disabilities are at advanced level in  listening and speaking. However, they scored at the beginning and intermediate levels of language acquisition.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   1a. There are 3 First Grade students, 1 Second Grade student, 2 Third Grade students, 2 Fourth Grade students, and 1  Fifth Grade   student. There are 2 students at the Advanced Level of Proficiency, and 2 students on the Intermediate Level Level of   English proficiency. The languages spoken other than English with the largest representation are the following:  Spanish and French   Haitian Creole. The parent choice indicated in the Parent Survey and Program Selection is a preference for  Freestanding ELL services andthis has been the trend over the past three years. Consequently, we have a  Freestanding, pull out ESL program. However, collected student data indicated the need for an additional component,  push-in to the existing program.   b. We have one certified ELL teacher. She groups the students homogenously by proficiency level. The primary goal of  the ELL program is to amplify the literacy and academic skills of ELLS by incorporating recognized and research based  ELL instructional strategies across content subject areas. Instruction in the ELL class is differentiated to meet the  needs of all the students.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

Organization of our staff insures that the mandated number of minutes of instruction are provided by the  proficiency level of our ELL students . All of our students including ELL students receive at least 450 minutes of ELA instruction  per week in addition to allotted services as per CR Part 154 (360 minutes for beginners/intermediate students, 180 for  advanced students. ELL strategies are aligned with the UDL principles, and include TPR, content area instruction using  scaffolding strategies, modeling, interactive read alouds, graphic organizers, mapping journal writing, academic accountable  talk, use of picture dictionaries, reading folders/student records of books and responses to reading, book of the month,  buddy/partner reading, writing folders/collection of student samples/ writing process (4 square writing), oral reading/running  records and written tests /homework. Both the Teachers College and Go Math Programs support differentiating instruction in  targeting our ELL students. During reading the students participate in read alouds, independent reading, shared and guided  instruction and mini-lessons. ELL students work with challenging activities that meet their unique learning styles and recognize  the diversity of their cultural backgrounds. Our ELL students across grades K-5 are provided with ELL instruction to insure their  development of English language proficiency in the four modalities: listening, reading, writing and speaking. All instruction is  data and CCS standards driven which prepares the students to perform successfully on standardized tests.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model.

How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?                    We insure that ELL students are evaluated in their native Language by ordering assessment (Math, and Science) in  their Native   Language (when available).       5.

Teachers model the use of academic language in ways in which students are expected to respond and participate.  Instructional   materials include a wide range of print, visual and digital resources designed for increasing English language proficiency.  Sudents   who arrive in third grade or later are required to take the ELA test after one year. We provide all newcomers with adequate   support while preparing them to take the ELA, Math and Science tests through inclusion in our in our AIS and Extended Day  and    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      intervention programs . Word to word dictionaries and glossaries are provided to support these students on the Math and  Science   city and state assessments and translated versions can be used when necessary. Students may also work in small groups with  their   classroom teachers to target specific areas of need, especially for test taking skills’ practice.   c. ELL students with 4-6 years will participate in small group, task oriented situations that guide the production of language in  both   verbal and written form. Emphasis of instruction, differentiated and flexible grouping will be placed in test sophistication skills  and   linguistic situations that prepare this population for successful performance during standardized testing. In addition, these  students   will receive AIS and Extended Day services to reinforce additional instruction in reading and math.   d. An analysis of the scores on the NYSESLAT of the Long term ELL students suggests their problem is in reading and writing.  For this   group we will monitor the their progress in all content areas to differentiate instruction for literacy needs. Emphasis of  instruction,   differentiated and flexible grouping will be placed in test sophistication skills and linguistic situations that prepare this  population   for successful performance during standardized testing. We will encourage their participation in all school programs to enrich  their   language and academic skills. We will have ongoing communication with the parents to monitor their children’s progress. They  will   be assigned to teachers during Extended Day and AIS in order to reinforce and provide them with additional help in reading  and   math .   e. Former ELL students will be supported through AIS instruction and consultation with the ESL teacher and will receive two   subsequent years of testing modifications (i.e extended time, separate location).         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELL-SWDs use the Common Core standards complemented by a well-developed, content-rich curriculum. The ELL   teacher provides additional material, which provides background knowledge and supports different learning styles.  Supplementary materials include pictures that illustrate vocabulary words and concepts. Visuals may include charts and graphs  that help students who have difficulty processing large amounts of auditory instruction. Books that are simplified and contain  more photographs or pictures, captions and vocabulary word definitions may also provide supplements without diminishing  the information students need to learn. For ELL students who are special needs there will be collaboration between the ELL  teacher and the classroom teacher to insure that the ELL teacher is familiar with the IEP and the students specific needs and all  services are provided according to IEP mandates.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   Our school ensures that ELL-SWDs are involved in all school wide activities and trips as all other students in the school.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   Targeted interventions programs for Ell students at P.S. 346 .in ELA, math and other areas are AIS, Extended day Literacy and  Math. The language of instruction is English. The ELL teacher and classroom teacher analyze each student’s performance   scores on each of the four modalities: reading, writing , listening and speaking on the spring NYSESLAT Test. This information  helps   them to provide the interventions necessary for each student. The ELL teacher will collaborate with the classroom teacher, the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      Extended Day Teacher and the AIS teacher who provides instruction to these students. These teachers will analyze the data to  set differentiated learning goal for each student to accelerate their learning in mastering the NYS Core Curriculum standards  and goals. Our data has shown that ELL students continue to perform lowest on the Reading and Writing subset of the  NYSESLAT. Students whose performance on the reading subtests of the NYSESLAT is low will be provided with additional help  in reading during the day guided reading, and in AIS. Teachers will closely monitor each student’s growth. Students whose  performance on the writing subtest of the spring NYSESLAT is low will be offered extra help in writing in the AIS program and  during the school day. Teachers will focus on practicing close reading, note taking and writing short response after listening to  a selection read by the teacher. ELL student progress in math will be monitored through Go Math unit and monthly  assessments . Children who need additional help will receive additional help in the AIS.ELL students’ academic performance in  Science and Social Studies will be monitored by the classroom and cluster teacher and weakness will be addressed through  differentiated instruction in reading.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       We implemented a push-in model in addition to the pull-out model of instruction.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kevin Caifa, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We use the Home Language Survey to determine the primary language spoken by the parent and in what  language the parent would like to receive written information from the school. We maintain an appropriate and  current record of the primary language in ATS and on the student emergency card. Presently, only one parent has  communicated on the HLS that she would like to receive in information in Spanish. We have provided notices in  Spanish for this parent using the DOE website We have in house staff (Paras and Teacher) that we use to  communicate orally with this parent who speaks Spanish. We continue to monitor requests for written translation  in other languages and provide materials as necessary for incoming students. We also utilize over-the-phone  interpretation services, as needed to communicate with incoming parents who may speak languages not spoken  by school staff. The findings of parent requests are discussed during SLT and PTA meetings.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55     2.

How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We will provide oral interpretation services If necessary, we will provide timely translation and distribution to parents  about their child's education into the covered languages(Arabic, Bengai, Chinese,Haitian Creole, Korean,  Russian,Spanish and Urdu). We use the DOE website for translations for translated critical documents. We provide  parents whose primary language is a covered language and who require language assistance with written notification  of the Parent Bill of Rights regarding translation and and interpretation sevices. We have staff in our building who are  able to communicate with parents in other languages. Ms. Emily Sierra and Ms. Carmen Escobar are school aides who  assist with translation and interpretation in Spanish. Our Parent Coordinator, Ms. Hawker, has solicited parents who  speak Russian and Chinese to assist with communication. When needed, we utilize over the phone interpretation  and/or submit requests to Translation Services. We continue to report our findings at SLT and PTA meetings,through  school newsletters in the Parental involvement section of the school's LAP and in the CEP.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57
