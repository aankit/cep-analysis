This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At PS 189, all stakeholders collaborate to provide rigorous educational experiences that support each child's  academic, social and emotional growth. We strive to create a safe learning environment where confidence and self- esteem are nurtured, opinions are valued and children persevere through challenges to achieve success and become  compassionate global citizens.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Public School 189 Magnet School of Inquiry and Expression is an elementary school, located in Washington Heights,  serving over 700 students from pre-kindergarten through fifth grade. At P.S. 189, school staff, administration, parents,  students and the community at large are committed to doing whatever it takes to ensure that success for every child  is the only option, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender and socioeconomic status. As a community of learners  committed to the success of every child, all staff members collaborated in developing our school wide Core Beliefs  about how students learn best. We consider these Core Beliefs to be essential for student learning:              Students learn best when they are provided with a safe, supportive and respectful learning environment  Students learn best when they are provided with an opportunity to engage in student-centered learning, with  discussions that promote understanding and critical thinking  Students learn best when various assessments are used to monitor students' progress and multiple  opportunities for improvement are provided  Students learn best when they are provided with timely and specific feedback   Our school environment, instructional practices, curricula and student learning reflect our beliefs.   PS 189 is one of four District 6 schools awarded a Magnet Schools Assistance Program (MSAP) grant. As the Magnet  School of Inquiry and Expression, PS 189's curricula will focus on actively engaging students in project-based learning  experiences that support important 21st century skills such as critical thinking, collaboration, creativity and  communication. Students will engage in real-world scenarios where they apply knowledge to different social justice  issues such as human rights, equity, and global citizenship using STEM based-activities. We look forward to providing  our students the opportunity to participate in after-school enrichment programs in areas such as coding, video  production, multimedia arts and robotics that will support hands-on student learning.    We are very proud of the many partnerships and services we provide to support the whole child and address the  complex process of raising physically, socially, emotionally, and academically successful children. Every partnership  and collaboration the school engages in is initiated with the idea of developing skills that will improve student  outcomes, preparing our student for success in school and career. In order to provide our students with a strong  foundation in the arts, support self-esteem and raise awareness about important health topics, our students  participate in the following programs:      National Dance Institute engages our first & fourth grade students in programs where students work together   and develop personal standards of excellence, a pride of achievement and a curiosity about the world.      The Dancing Classrooms program provides all our fifth-grade students an opportunity to cultivate essential   life skills through the art of social dance. This enrichment activity allows them to develop positive self esteem  and learn teamwork skills.     Through our collaboration with the 92nd Street Y, students in third grade explore musical genres, engage in      music making and learn about rich musical traditions in class and through a series of performances.   Swim for Life provides our second grade students with water safety education as well as an opportunity for  recreation, fitness and socialization outside of the school environment.     Chess In the Schools teaches our third grade students the complex game of chess, providing them with the      opportunity to collaborate with peers and develop critical thinking, problem solving and decision-making  skills.  Fourth grade classes participate in the Project Start Science program provided by Yeshiva University students.  The program enriches science instruction, providing students with the opportunity to conduct hands-on  science experiments aligned to the New York City Scope and Sequence.     To expand learning opportunities for students whose families face language barriers and literacy challenges,   we will continue to implement the Teens Involved in Education (TIE) program, where local high school  students work with our students to provide tutoring/homework assistance.     During this school year, we will continue our partnership with New York Presbyterian Hospital in the Choosing   Healthy & Active Lifestyles for Kids (CHALK) program. The goal of the program is obesity prevention through   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      education, environmental change, and connecting schools with resources. CHALK has supported students,  staff and families via the implementation of a healthy lifestyles program at PS 189.      All Kindergarten and First grade students will continue to participate in Music and the Brain (MATB), a music  education program and curriculum funded by the 42nd Street Development Corporation grant. Students in K- 1 will participate in MATB classes for two periods per week with a MATB trained and licensed music teacher  providing instruction using keyboards. It is MATB's philosophy and our goal that the program will help  students improve mathematics skills, attention and listening skills, problem solving skills, critical thinking,  socialization and enhance creativity, self-expression and self-esteem. PS 189 will extend the opportunity for  second grade students to participate in this program by providing an after school program that will continue  the music education that they received in first grade.     The New York Presbyterian Hospital's Turn 2 Us program, funded by Derek Jeter ‘Turn 2 Foundation, Inc.,  engages a group of our fourth & fifth grade students and motivates them to excel in their school work and  relationship with peers. This program supports our students’ positive social-emotional development and sets  high expectations for individual student academic progress. The activities are designed to teach students the  value of teamwork and develop their ability to express themselves in a healthy fashion. Such activities  sponsored by the Turn 2 Us program are the PS 189 co-ed basketball and baseball teams.     During this school year all classes in second, third and fourth grade will participate in a ten week residency   with Theatre Moves. Theatre Moves is literacy based and is designed to motivate students to express  themselves through acting and support the development of self-esteem and expressive language.    Our partnership with Community Based Organizations (CBO):      Inwood Community Services provides opportunity for 210 students in grades Kindergarten through fifth to  participate in the COMPASS after school and summer programs. The program allows students to engage in a  variety of academic, recreational, enrichment and cultural activities to support and strengthen their overall  development. The after school program integrates literacy into all instruction; offers homework help, basic  arts instruction and physical activity, including nutritional programming to promote healthy living.      Time Bank, aides us in further integrating our community with other communities in New York City. This      partnership allows our parents to share professional and personal skills with other communities who have a  need for assistance in these areas. The time donated is banked and then requested in specific areas as needed  by the school and community.  Literacy Inc. (LINC) supports us in building strong partnerships between our families, educators and  community. They sponsor school wide events such as; Academic Family Nights, VIP Parent trainings, T.I.G.E.R.  reading activities, Reading Buddies and contests, to name a few. In collaboration with our Parent Coordinator,  this year Linc. will support our school in developing a program to engage Parent volunteers in classrooms, as  tutors and for all school events.     Our commitment to the social-emotional well-being of our students, many of whom face daunting life   challenges, is a priority. Students and their families receive essential School-Based Mental Health services  through our partnership with New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital. This program  provides a full-time on-site Psychologist who provides essential and critical services directly to our students  and their families. A series of Parenting Workshops are offered to engage parents in relevant and important  topics. The goal of the program is to increase access to psychological care while keeping children in their  educational settings and optimizing their achievement and functioning. We will extend our partnership with  New York Presbyterian hospital by participating in CAMS classroom. CAM's Classroom consists of a three- tiered approach to support wellness in the school and offer additional preventive interventions.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The academic performance of Students with Disabilities (SWD) and English as a New Language (ENL) students  continues to be a concern, as both groups represent a high percentage of students performing at Level 1 in both ELA  and Mathematics as evidence by student outcomes on the 2018 New York State (NYS) English Language Arts (ELA) and  NYS Mathematics Assessments. This data indicates that the number of SWD students on level 1 in ELA is 7.2% (27) and  in Mathematics is 7.7% (30). The number of ENL students on level 1 in ELA is 19.9% (75) and in Mathematics it is  21.2% (83). Review of these assessments indicates that the performance of SWD students on levels 3 & 4 in ELA was   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      2.9% (11) and in Mathematics 2% (8). The performance of ENL students on levels 3 & 4 in ELA was 3.2% (12) and in  Mathematics 4.1% (16).   During the 2018-2019 school year we will provide all teachers in grades Kindergarten through fifth a weekly  Collaborative Inquiry period dedicated to improve the quality and use of formative assessment data to support our  priority of providing student centered learning and differentiated instruction that meets the needs of all students  including SWD and ENL students. During this period teacher teams analyze student data, examine and implement  instructional best practices, monitor student progress and work together to build on our students’ strengths and  address learning gaps. We will continue to develop and increase our knowledge of Mastery Connect as a tool to track  and measure individual student progress on school assessments aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards  (CCLS).       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our school’s Leadership Team and Parent Teacher Association are fully operational and our Parent Coordinator and  Family Workers work extensively with families, to meet the individual needs of our students and their families. To  strengthen our relationship we will welcome our parents and entire school community in a new Parent Welcome  Center and we will provide learning opportunities in the new Parent Resource Center. We have dedicated financial  and personnel resources to provide in-school guidance support for our students and their families. The result of this  commitment is that 95% of our parents provided positive responses in the Outreach to Parents component of the  Strong Family and Community Ties on the 2018 Framework for Great Schools report. We will continue to reach out to  involve parents and families to build and maintain strong school-family-community ties.     Our New York State 2018 assessment data shows that 43.3% of students performed on levels 3 & 4 in the ELA  assessment and 31.2% of students performed on levels 3 & 4 in the Mathematics assessment. This is a 20% and 8.4%  increase respectively from the outcomes in 2017. An analysis of the 2018 June Instructional report and the PS 189 End  of Year (EOY) assessments supports our decision to focus on strengthening our students' mastery of standards under  Key Ideas and Details in both informational and literary texts. In mathematics we will focus on strengthening our  students' mastery of standards under Operations and Algebraic Thinking (K-2) and Number and Operations: Fractions  (3-5). To provide multiple opportunities for students to engage in this work we are implementing the i-Ready Adaptive  Diagnostic program and i-Ready Online Instruction program. This year we will also implement Ready as one of our two  math curricula in third through fifth grade. All classes will continue to implement an increased number of minutes  dedicated to mathematics instruction daily.    We understand that our students' successes depend on the effective instructional practices of our teachers and the  support of parents and families. To this end, we continue to allocate resources in order to provide teachers with  extensive support and professional development that focuses on student-centered learning, critical thinking  questions, discussion techniques and formative assessment. All staff members have provided input and voice into  their own professional needs during the End of Year conferences, Teacher Team agendas, and United Federation of  Teachers (UFT) Consultation Committee agendas. During the End of Year conferences all teachers identified a  pedagogical practice that had the greatest impact on student learning based on data and one area of growth for the  upcoming year. An analysis of these reflections allows the school to pair teachers with colleagues based on areas of  strength and identified needs. It also supports the school in designing a Professional Learning (PL) plan that is  differentiated based on teacher needs and supported by data from the Measure of Teacher Practice (MOTP) ratings  on the Advance Evaluation System.    As indicated by the 2018 Framework for Great Schools report, the areas identified for continued growth are Effective  School Leadership and Trust. We will continue the implementation of initiatives that target components of these  elements, such as our Parents Involved in Education (P.I.E.) program, Community Engagement Committee, Behavioral  Supports Committee, Grade Team Leaders, Vertical Team Inter-visitation Protocols, Teacher Workshops during Parent  Engagement sessions, Supervisor's Outreach protocol to name a few. Our school leadership cabinet’s commitment to  supporting and nurturing teachers’ professional growth, leading to improved student achievement is evidenced by   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      frequent and targeted actionable feedback through the Advance Evaluation system and continuous formative  informal feedback conducted individually with teachers.    Considering the compelling research about the significance of assessment of student learning and effective feedback  correlating to improved student outcomes and in consideration of supervisory observations and teachers’ ratings this  year, it is determined that for the 2018-2019 school year our Leadership's focus for teacher improvement will be  Using Assessment in Instruction (Danielson Framework for Teaching, component 3d). We will continue to refine our  data tracking tool and structures that support the school in further developing an assessment-informed school culture  where leaders, teachers, and students use formative and summative assessment data to direct and enhance learning.  Frequent follow-up will ensure that students are implementing the feedback provided by teachers to improve their  work and achieve greater academic progress. By strengthening this practice teachers will strengthen student-centered  learning, ensuring opportunities for students to engage and interact with rigorous content to deepen conceptual  understanding.    Based on an analysis of multiple sources of data and in consideration of the District-wide priorities, we have  determined that for the 2018-2019 academic school year our instructional focus is to strengthen instruction and  improve student outcomes through the use formative assessments and feedback.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 06M189   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   813   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     According to the School Year 2017/2018 Quality Review the following are areas of strength for our school:            Instructional shifts evidenced in lesson and unit plans stress academic vocabulary development, increase use  of non-fiction and informational text, and stating evidence to support opinions and analysis in all subject  areas.  School leaders' communicate high expectations for the level and quality of teacher professionalism,  instruction, communication and other criteria related to the Danielson Framework for Teaching utilizing  Advance reports and informal individual conferences with teachers.  School leaders and staff provide ongoing feedback to families that help them understand student progress  toward meeting high expectations and engage in meaningful partnerships with families to support students'  progress toward college and career readiness.   In the 2018 New York City School Survey, PS 189 achieved a 3.33 score for Rigorous Instruction which is within the  range of meeting target. Assessment data from 2018 indicates that 43.3% (163) of our students attained a level 3 or 4  in the NYS ELA Assessment, which is a 20% increase from the results in 2017, and 31.2% (122) of our students attained  a level 3 or 4 in the NYS Mathematics Assessment, which is an 8.4% increase from the results in 2017.    According to the 2018 NYC School Survey report 63% of our teachers reported positive to the Quality of Student  Discussion however 37% did not. The 2017-2018 Quality Review Report indicates that inconsistencies in pedagogical  practices result in uneven engagement in appropriately challenging tasks and uneven demonstration of higher-order  thinking skills in student work, including for English as a New Language (ENL) students and Students with Disabilities  (SWD).   Areas for improvement:     Ensure consistency of teaching practices across content areas and grades that provide all students   opportunities to engage in student-centered learning, with discussions that promote understanding and  critical thinking.      Consistent use of data to design and implement lessons that improve students' Mathematics and ELA   outcomes with a particular focus on ENL students and SWDs in order to close the achievement gap of these  students.      Ensure that Special Education and ENL teachers increase their knowledge and understanding of Specially   Designed Instruction to enable them to design and implement structured lessons with meaningful  modifications for ENLs and SWDs that impact student academic growth.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  In terms of the Capacity Framework, Supportive Environment, PS 189 strengths in this area include:      Implementation of a uniform school-wide positive behavioral support system (S.T.A.R.S.) that resulted in an  86%, 68% and 81% positive teacher response in the components of Safety, Classroom Behavior, and Social- Emotional respectively on the Framework for Great Schools 2018 Survey.     The Behavioral Supports Committee (BSC), comprised of teachers and interested P.S. 189 staff members,  collaborated to develop a common language to clearly communicate behavioral expectations across the  building. The committee continues to work on a system to ensure that all members of the school community  consistently convey high expectations for behavior and uniformly implement incentives designed to recognize  and encourage positive behavior.     Reduced the number of level 1-5 incidents in the Online Occurrence Reporting System (OORS) from 53 (77%)   during the First term of SY 17-18 (September - January) to 16 (23%) during the second term of SY 17-18  (February - June).  Of the 57 level 3 & 4 incidents 47 occurred in the first term. According to the 2017-2018  Incident Level and Infraction Summary: Level 1-5 Incidents, our school had a total of 69 incidents; there were  0 level 5 incidents, 36 Level 4 incidents, 21 level 3 incidents and 12 incidents were levels 1 & 2.   Areas for Improvement:     The School Quality Guide report reflects that 76% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in   their classes follow the rules. However, only 61% of teachers responded positively that a lot or all of the  students in their classes behave well in class when the teacher isn’t watching. To support students’ social and  emotional development, maximize academic and social success and impact classroom behavior the school  must strengthen the school-wide code of behavior and continue to promote the consistent use of a common  language (S.T.A.R.S.) that conveys high expectations and provides clear guidance for student behavior, across  all grades and throughout the entire school community.     According to our 2017-2018 School Quality Guide report, PS 189 obtained a score of 68% in the area of   Classroom Behavior. This score is lower than the City average score of 75% and District average score of 76%.  To support teachers in managing classroom behavior and applying strategies that improve students’ social  and emotional growth, teachers must continue to receive training in Social Emotional Learning (SEL) and will  implement strategies to improve classroom behavior/de-escalation in order to support the development of  pro-social behaviors in all students throughout grades PreK-5. Teachers who have participated in SEL,  Therapeutic Crisis Intervention Strategies (TCIS) & Life Crisis Intervention Strategies (LCIS) professional  development will lead training sessions for their colleagues. Opportunity for teachers to attend PD sponsored  by the Manhattan Field Support Center (MFSC) and private institutions will also be provided.

In terms of the Capacity Framework, Collaborative Teachers, PS 189's strengths in this area include:      Teachers engage in weekly collaborations as Inquiry Teams that focus on attainment of school goals. In   weekly collaborative inquiry team meetings, teachers analyze relevant data, identify common challenges, and  implement a variety of instructional approaches to improve student outcomes.     Common planning periods are embedded within teacher programs so teams have a regular opportunity to   develop unit and lesson plans aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS). During planning  sessions teachers utilize assessment data to identify student needs, develop instructional goals, and share  effective teaching techniques/strategies to enable students to have access to the challenging curriculum.      The school utilizes Google Drive, a cloud based platform, for gathering data and sharing electronic resources   to ensure access and promote a collaborative school culture.     Teachers have developed several methods of providing feedback to students including checklists and rubrics.    Our school’s SY 2017-2018 Principal Performance Review (PPR) / Measures of Leadership Practice (MOLP) indicates  that our rating for Quality Indicator 1.1, Curriculum, is well developed. For Quality Indicators 4.2, Teacher Teams, and  1.2, Pedagogy our ratings were Proficient.    Area for Improvement:      Strengthen teacher pedagogy to ensure that lessons consistently incorporate multiple entry points and high- quality supports with appropriate and temporary scaffolds.     Continue to refine assessment practices to ensure students receive corrective instruction and multiple   opportunities to experience success in their learning.     Ensure that teacher's feedback to students is timely, specific to learning goals and rubrics, and offers   suggestions for improvement so that students make use of the feedback to improve their performance.      Develop inter-visitation structures across classrooms and grades to afford teachers opportunities to to   observe and learn from the teaching practice of colleagues and feedback from peers.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   In terms of the Capacity Framework, Effective School Leadership, P.S. 189's strengths include:      The leadership cabinet consistently uses the Danielson Framework for Teaching to support professional   growth and reflection through frequent observations and feedback that clearly identifies professional next  steps that influence teaching and student achievement as evidenced by a 20% increase in student  achievement on the 2018 NYS ELA assessment and a 8.4% increase on the 2018 NYS Mathematics  assessment.  Feedback provided to teachers consistently identifies strengths, challenges and clear expectations to further  support their development and maximize their impact on student learning as evidenced by 100% of Advance  observation reports provided to teachers during the 2017-2018 school year.        The instructional cabinet and classroom teachers participate in weekly grade specific Inquiry periods to  identify key standards, which are tracked along the year in the Mastery Connect database using uniform  assessments. Instructional goals and objectives are determined and common assessments (formative and  summative) are analyzed to adjust instruction and target individual need.   The following are identified as areas in need of refinement at our school:   An analysis of SY 2017-2018 Advance Dashboard reports and Measure of Teacher Practice (MOTP) summary reports  reveals that our teachers scored lower in Domain 3– Instruction (components 3b, 3c, 3d) as compared to their ratings  for Domain 2- Classroom Environment (components 2a and 2d).  According to the Measures of Teacher Practice  Report during the 2017-2018 school year 62% of teachers received an Effective/Highly Effective rating in Domain 3-  Instruction; 5.2% of teachers received a rating of ineffective, 32.6% developing, 60.8% effective and 1.3% highly  effective. We observed that the feedback and professional development provided to teachers, as a result of formal  and informal observations, is not consistently evident in the vast majority of classrooms.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  During the 2018-2019 school year, school leaders will utilize a monitoring system to ensure feedback provided during all  observations and professional development is implemented consistently across all classrooms, leading to an increase of  teacher effective/highly effective ratings in Domain 3 from 62% to 75%.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  School administrators work with the Department of Human Resource to ensure that all teachers are highly qualified.  The following are strategies used by the school in support of hiring and retaining highly qualified teachers:      A hiring committee was established consisting of administrators and teachers. The committee develops   questions and scenarios specific to the grade level/s of the positions needed. Different members participate  when interviews are conducted prior to the end of the school year and when available during the summer  months.     The week prior to the start of the school year new teachers (and teachers new to the school) are invited to a   Meet and Greet with administrators, coaches and lead teachers. During the day new teachers have an  opportunity to meet colleagues, are provided and review the PS 189 Teacher Handbook, Danielson  Framework for Teaching, Chancellor's regulations and participate in workshops focused on instructional and  classroom management routines implemented in our school.  Instructional coaches and other staff members work with teachers to set up classroom environments and  ensure that teachers are familiar with all instructional materials.        A weekly new teacher common preparation period provides new teachers with targeted and differentiated  professional development (PD). Our instructional coaches design workshops on classroom management &  routines, lesson development and implementation, the school's Coherent Set of Beliefs of How Student Learn  Best, thinking routines & discussion protocols to name a few.     Grade level common preps are provided for teachers to collaborate with colleagues in teacher teams.    During the first month of school experienced teachers are assigned to co-teach and model best practices in   the classrooms with new teachers.     All new teachers are assigned a mentor that will work with them throughout the school year.    New teachers and developing teachers participate in at least one cycle of PD provided by consultants and   instructional coaches.     All new teachers are scheduled in the first cycle of PD with one of the school's four instructional coaches,   consultants and/or lead teachers. This support is ongoing throughout the school year, based on needs  identified through observations and teacher reflection.     All teachers are provided with opportunities to attend PD offered by the DOE and private companies/   consultants throughout the year.     The school's PL plan gives teachers opportunity to choose workshops based on individual needs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44        During the End of Year conferences, conducted by the principal, all teachers identify the professional learning   opportunities that most impacted their practice and what supports they will need for the following year in  order to continue improving and developing highly effective practices.      Teachers preparing portfolios for Tenure decisions receive additional specific support in preparing artifacts   and evidence of effective instructional practice, impact on student outcomes, and professional contributions  to the school.      Teachers working with a Teacher Improvement Plan (TIP) receive targeted support to improve teaching   practices and progress is monitored in individual conferences.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).      Teacher growth is supported through specific, low inference, evidence-based feedback from the Principal and   Assistant Principals. Administrators implement PD during individual meetings with teachers focusing on  observed needs. This includes but is not limited to developing lessons with rigorous questions and challenging  tasks, designing checks for understanding, developing assessments, using data to group students, modeling  instruction, providing website resources.      The IEP teacher's responsibilities include the planning and implementation of PD on Mondays for         paraprofessionals to develop their knowledge to effectively work with individual and small groups of  students.  Instructional coaches, consultants, mentors, Professional Development Team members and supervisors plan  and provide PD to meet the differentiated and developmental needs of teachers. New teachers receive the  maximum support and experienced teachers have leadership opportunities to help support the professional  learning throughout the school.   Instructional coaches and/or DOE Staff work with teachers in developing specific strategies to support the  learning needs of ELLs and SWDs in reading comprehension, academic vocabulary, and written analysis of  texts, both literary and non-fiction.     The school's PL plan gives teachers opportunity to choose learning cycles based on individual needs.    During the End of Year conferences, conducted by the principal, all teachers identify the professional learning   opportunities that most impacted their practice and what supports they will need for the following year in  order to continue improving and developing highly effective practices.     Provide year-long mentors and professional development opportunities for teachers.    Teachers, paraprofessionals, coaches and administrators attend Professional Development sessions provided  by the DOE, Borough Field Support Center (BFSC) and private organizations, i.e. Special Education workshops;  ELL workshops; RTI; City-wide workshops, etc. based on needs. Funds are allocated for per diem coverage to  facilitate this during the school day.     The school Principal and Assistant Principals attend monthly Professional Learning Opportunities (PLO)   provided by the Superintendent and district staff.      The school leadership attends PD provided by the Executive Leadership Institute (ELI), and conferences      sponsored by Association of Assistant Principals and Council of Supervisors and Administrators.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).     We prepare our pre-kindergarten students and our kindergarten students with developmentally appropriate   routines, curriculum, and pedagogy that are aligned to Common Core Foundational Standards for PreK and  contribute to students' emotional and social well-being and growth.     Teachers use the Early Screening Inventory- Revised (ESI-R) to individually screen students to determine if  students may need early intervention services. These student outcomes are used to develop individualized  instruction and student progress is monitored using the Work Sampling System throughout the year.      Teachers, paraprofessionals, family worker and social worker, as well as parent coordinator ensure close   home-school connections, on an ongoing basis. Monthly parent workshops focus on skills students will need  upon entering kindergarten. These hands-on workshops provide parents with CCLS aligned activities they can  make/do at home to strengthen foundational skills.     The pre-k social worker and our early grade guidance counselor provide parents with information regarding   academic and social expectations for kindergarten during scheduled workshops and individual meetings.  Parents are provided support as they initiate the process of obtaining early intervention services.     Pre-K teachers work collaboratively with kindergarten teachers throughout the year. Vertical team meetings  (Pre-K & Kindergarten) and professional development activities permit teachers to be trained together while  having opportunities to discuss curriculum and student needs.     All early grade staff participates in school-wide PD to ensure continuity and appropriate learning targets and   progressions. During the spring term Pre-K teachers will be scheduled for inter-visitations in kindergarten  classrooms so they have an opportunity to prepare their students for the transition to kindergarten.      Students’ records are kept by all teachers and are shared as the students are promoted from the early grades  to the upper grades. Teachers receiving these children have full and clear portraits of the students as learners  in all dimensions of growth and development.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46        Teachers on the Measure of Student Learning Team (MOSL) determine appropriate school-wide measures.     Teacher teams engage in a Lesson Study Protocol that consists of analyzing data, identifying a problem of   practice, collaboratively designing a lesson, implementing the lesson implementing a lab site model and  analyzing the effectiveness of the lesson based on student outcomes.     The school's Instructional coaches meet weekly with grade level teacher teams to develop, calibrate and      revise assessment based on curriculum and student performance.  In grades K - 5 teacher teams participate in a weekly Collaborative Inquiry period where they analyze student  data, examine and implement instructional best practices, monitor student progress and determine action  steps to improve teacher and student learning for all learners, including ELLs and SWDs.      We have partnered with Assessment Matters and Mastery Connect to implement an assessment tool and  structure that will support the school in further developing an assessment-informed school culture where  leaders, teachers, and students use formative and summative assessment data to direct and enhance  learning. Our instructional cabinet, consisting of the principal, assistant principal, literacy coaches, math and  technology coach and teacher leader, will be trained by consultants and provide training to all teachers. PD  will be provided in teacher teams and individually as needed.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)   Column B   Section Reference(s)  5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, 6,  7 & 8     5b, 5d     5a,5b, 5c, 5e, 6     4b     5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, 6   Title I Part A (Basic)   Federal   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   533,450.00      114,283.00     29,646.00     6,114.00     4,437,800.00   X      X     X     X     X        1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47     State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) Template    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 189, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Every Student Succeeds  Act (ESSA) and in conjunction with the parent coordinator, School Leadership Team, PTA executive members will work  to involve all parents. Through parent meetings, parent bulletins, school website and phone messenger, parents will  continue to be informed regularly about all school matters. Workshops will continue to be presented on strategies  and activities directly related to the school’s programs, curriculum and initiatives. In addition, workshops will be  tailored to parents’ needs and interests. The Parents involved in Education Program (PIE) will continue to provide  classes, workshops and activities that will equip parents with skills and strategies that will enhance their lives. The  Parent Coordinator will facilitate and support all parental involvement activities at PS 189.    The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       P.S. 189 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Each program will have a maximum of 6  teachers.  Depending on teacher availability and interest each program may be implemented by different  sets of teachers.    Rationale: NYSESLAT  data for  2018,  shows that 190 students who were tested in grades K-5 are  currently in our school.  Student proficiency level results are as follows: 12% (22 students) scored a  proficiency level of Commanding,  43% (82 students) scored a proficiency level of Expanding, 22% (42  students) scored a proficiency level of Transitioning,  16% (30 students) scored a proficiency level of  Emerging, 9% (18 students) scored a proficiency level of Entering.   Therefore, based on the performance  of English Language Learners in grades K-5, we have identified speaking and writing as the modalities in  which students require additional instructional support.  In order to provide students with supplemental  instruction we have created 2 after-school programs that will run in the winter and spring.    After-School Programs Activities: Students will engage in a variety of activities incorporating all four  modalities; listening, reading, speaking and writing, however asking and answering questions and  providing explicit instruction in writing across content areas will be the focus.  Students will read  leveled  informational trade books to gain content knowledge, develop academic and content specific  vocabulary, and cite textual evidence.   Students will engage in the writing process as they produce writing  pieces.  Students will engage in meaningful discussions using a discussion protocol and accountable talk  stems.        Winter After-School ELL Enrichment Program:  In order to address the needs identified as per 2018 NYSESLAT data, students will participate in speaking,  reading and writing activities focused on Informational texts.  Teachers will provide instruction aligned to  Common Core Standards and differentiate based on specific language needs of individual students.      Subgroup: We have identified 53 English Language Learners in  grades 1-5 who did not make progress of  at least one proficiency level on the 2018 NYSESLAT compared to 2017 NYSESLAT proficiency  level.  These students have been in an English school system for more than one year.  Among the 53  English Language Learners  identified as per the 2018 NYSESLAT there are 20 students who remained on  a Transitioning proficiency level, 28 students who remained on an Expanding proficiency level, 5 students  remained on either an Entering or Emerging Proficiency level.  <!-- {cke_protected}%3Cmeta%20name%3D%22generator%22%20content%3D%22Sheets%22%20%2F%3E- ->  Schedule and Duration:   We have developed an After-School ELL Enrichment Program that will run for 8 consecutive  weeks.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?    The assessment tools used to assess the early literacy skills of our ELL students K-1 are Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early  Literacy Skills (DIBELS NEXT) and Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment  System for English assessment of all our ELL  students K-5.     The DIBELS NEXT assessment tests fluency, accuracy and phonemic awareness, however, it does not assess student  comprehension rates. SInce ELLs will naturally slow down when applying comprehension strategies, we have been focusing on  increasing comprehension through guided reading practices.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      In order to gauge comprehension, we administer the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System for English, which  has enabled teachers to accurately assess ELLs reading levels and also design instruction to increase their reading levels by  utilizing running records. A K-5 Spanish counterpart is also used to assess students' native language literacy skill acquisition, as  well.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   In order to support the use of formative assessments to guide instructional planning for ELLs, we have put into place the  following structures:       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We are constantly evaluating the success of our ELLs in order to make instruction decisions and increase acquisition of  language, learning, and performance.  Professional Learning Teams, the school leadership, and individual teachers meet to  analyze results from the NYS ELA, NYS Mathematics, NYSESLAT, and Annual Measurable Achievement Objectives Tool.  Using  the data from these assessments our programs are modified and additional support is provided to ELLs in the form of ENL, AIS  and paraprofessional tutoring.  The members of our staff have multiple opportunities to discuss progress, and areas of  concern, including strategies that worked and those that didn’t.  We also use portfolios, rubrics and performance assessments  to get a clearer picture of student strength and need and we use these and other observational techniques to determine what  our students need.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    In order to support the use of summative assessments to guide instructional planning for ELLs, we have put into place the  following structures:       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school uses a variety of data to inform our instruction for ELLs.  We use DIBELS, IDEL, Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark  Running Records, NYC Baseline and Benchmark assessments, NYS ELA and Math assessments, and teacher created formative  assessments to guide our instruction for ELLs.  We analyze the data both at the classroom and school level to observe trends  and patterns, we then consider the corresponding adjustments needed to strengthen the instructional core and supplemental  supports, as they relate to ELLs.  We implement the 3 Tiered RTI Model where the Tier 1 is the classroom teacher who provides  daily instruction that meets the majority of students’ needs implementing scaffolds and differentiation as needed.  The Tier 2  consists of targeted intervention and instructional support for a smaller subset of students.  Our AIS staff pushes in and pulls  out students to provide these services for our ELLs. Additionally, we also have our paraprofessionals who reduce the groups of  students in the classroom and provide targeted intervention for students with varied language needs. Furthermore, both our  Reading Intervention Teachers and our Literacy Coach provide Tier 2 services to students based on assessment data.   The Tier  3 is individualized, specialized instruction for students with persistent difficulties.  Our Tier 3 is usually delivered by our Special  Education Specialists who provide at risk students with more intensive support and intervention.  We have also developed an  intervention program for SIFE and New Arrival students where they receive targeted support in beginning literacy skills in their  native language.  This support allows them to receive supplemental instruction in crucial foundational literacy skills.    In  addition, we’ve identified students based upon the data systems mentioned above who require assistance in accessing grade  appropriate complex text.  These students receive instruction in a small group afterschool on utilizing strategies that promote  critical thinking, interacting with text, and production of writing in the genres prescribed by the Common Core standards (ie.  opinion and informative writing).        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         We are constantly evaluating the success of our ELLs in order to make instruction decisions and increase acquisition of  language, learning, and performance. Professional Learning Teams, the school leadership, and individual teachers meet to  analyze result from the NYSESLAT, NYS ELA, NYS Mathematics and ELL Data Analysis Tool to determine areas of focus for our  ELL programs. Using the data from these assessments our programs are modified and additional support is provided to ELLs in  the form of ENL and AIS support. Teachers analyze data and plan instruction that includes necessary scaffolds to ensure  student progress. The members of our staff have multiple opportunities to discuss progress, and areas of concern, including  strategies that worked and those that didn't. We also use portfolios, rubrics and performance assessments to get a clearer  picture of student strength and need and we use these and other observational techniques to determine what our students  need.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?  The following structures are implemented in order to disseminate data as well as make adjustments to our program:           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   In order to provide students with the mandated ENL instruction, as per Part 154, and to promote student learning we  utilize various organizational models within our school.  Our classes are structured to accommodate the needs of our  ELLs, including those with special needs.  Currently, we have designated at least one Self-Contained ENL class taught  by a qualified dual certified teacher in Common Branch and ENL in grades K, and 2-4.  Students in these classes are  grouped by grade with heterogeneous language proficiency levels.  The classroom teacher provides both stand-alone  and integrated mandated ENL instruction for each child.  ENL methodologies are embedded seamlessly in instruction  through-out the day.   Our integrated ENL program in grades 1 and 4 is organized by grouping students according to  grade and proficiency levels.  Our program also includes a K-2 and 3-5 ENL teacher who integrates instruction with the  Common branch teacher during literacy, writing, and/or content area instructional time to provide integrated ENL  instruction.  Students are also serviced in small differentiated groups based upon their proficiency level to provide  stand alone ENL instruction.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Currently, we have a designated transitional bilingual class in each grade, including Bilingual Special Ed with multiple  grade spans. Our bilingual classes are heterogeneously grouped  by grade, containing students with varying language  proficiency levels.  As prescribed in CR Part 154, our bilingual teacher provide our students with HLA, as well as Stand- Alone and Integrated ENL instruction during the instructional day.  Students are serviced in small differentiated  groups based on proficiency levels in order to provide adequate stand-alone ENL instruction, as well as,  heterogeneous groups to provide integrated ENL instruction throughout the instructional day.      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not Applicable      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      Our staff is organized to ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes is delivered in each program model as per  CR Part 154.  Our classes are structured to accommodate the needs of our ELL students.  We have fully licensed, highly  qualified ENL and bilingual teachers.  All the teachers in the TBE classes possess a Bilingual Common Branch license.  Our  bilingual teachers demonstrate strong academic language proficiency in English and Spanish.   The teachers continue to receive  professional development opportunities as well as school initiatives in content and pedagogy.    All of our ELL students are serviced and some receive services that exceed the mandated amount of minutes as per CR Part  154.  Our students with Entering and Emerging language proficiency levels receive at least 360 minutes of ENL Instruction per  week.  The ENL instruction includes a minimum of 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA instruction and a maximum of 180  minutes of Stand Alone ENL instruction per week.  Students with a Transitioning proficiency level are provided with a minimum  of 180 minutes of ENL instruction with a minimum of 90 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA and a maximum of 90 minutes of  Stand Alone or Integrated ENL/Content instruction per week.  Students obtaining an Expanding level of Proficiency are  provided with a minimum of 180 minutes of Integrated ENL instruction per week.  As prescribed by CR Part 154, students who  obtain a Commanding Proficiency level will continue to receive a minimum of 90 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA or Content  instruction per week.      We have increased the number of ENL self-contained classes, as well as, group size to ensure that students receive more than  the mandated services.  ENL instruction is delivered through an integrated approach during literacy, writing and content area  instructional time throughout the day in monolingual and self-contained classes. Stand alone ENL instruction is delivered in  small differentiated groups based on proficiency level during literacy, writing and content area instructional time.     In TB classes students receive daily ENL instruction for at least 360 minutes per week regardless of their proficiency level with  a minimum of 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA during literacy, writing and/or content area instructional time throughout the  day.  This is done to provide our ELLs with the academic language and strategies necessary to access Common Core Aligned  curriculum.  HLA (Spanish) is delivered in all our TB classes during mathematics and/or literacy, writing and content area  instructional time. Students in TB classes receive a minimum of 180 minutes per week as per CR Part 154.      The ELL Supervisor, Specific Grade Supervisors, Classroom and Funded ENL teachers ensure that each class creates a schedule  that indicates the allocated instructional minutes for ENL, ELA, and HLA instruction as per the mandates of CR Part 154.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   In our monolingual and self-contained classrooms the content areas are delivered in English.  Dual Certified ENL teachers  integrate instruction with the common branch teacher and support instruction by integrating ENL methodologies to ensure  that the content is comprehensible to ELL students and that instruction is aligned to CCLS.      The organization of the Transitional Bilingual classes includes a 60/40 instructional plan with 60% of the instruction given in  the native language and 40% in English, which meets the Part 154 mandates.  The percentage of instruction is differentiated  based on the student’s ELL proficiency level as outlined above.  Instructional approaches and methods for transitional bilingual  classes are aimed to enrich language development and make content comprehensible.  Instruction is in place to facilitate the  transfer of students’ skills from Spanish to English while building on the first language to develop cognition.  Content-based  vocabulary and academic language is reinforced through the use of cognates and instructional strategies that help transfer  academic knowledge, comprehension and phonetic skills.  All of this is in aid of developing academic language in the content  areas.    In all grades children participate in a language arts curriculum that is aligned to Common Core State Standards  (CCLS).  Our  CCLS curriculum embeds the instructional shifts including the 50/50 use of fiction and non-fiction texts.  Since  many of our ELLs cannot read grade level material independently, we use a shared reading approach because we realize the  need for them to be exposed to grade-level text and to participate both orally and in writing with grade-level text with the  proper scaffolding.  The instructional practices that support this type of literacy model include whole class and small groups,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68      word study, read aloud, guided reading, shared reading with accountable talk, book clubs, conferencing, modeled writing, and  guided writing and strategy lessons.     There is an emphasis on frequent formal and informal assessments in the native language, Spanish, as well as  English.  Students are assessed using IDEL, DIBELS, Fountas and Pinnell Running Record Benchmarks in English and  Spanish,  teacher created formative assessments in both English and Spanish, and IReady technology driven assessments.  In  addition, students complete Unit Performance Tasks and receive guided reading instruction in their native language and in  English.  Materials used include Spanish guided books and Spanish language literature.  Students are grouped for instruction  based upon their instructional level in  Spanish.  Groups are dynamic and students move in and out of groups depending upon  teacher continuous evaluation.  These groups are flexible to allow for maximum support to children and their academic  growth.  Teacher assessments used include: unit assessments, interim and periodic assessments, Running Records  assessments, and informal teacher observations and conferences.      For the ENL component of the Transitional Bilingual program we use Spotlight on English by Santillana in grades K-5,  augmented with related trade-books.  As well as the English portion of the ReadyGen Bi-literacy Program.  Both these program  are used mostly for children who score in the entering and emerging proficiency levels.  The program is based upon social  studies themes and includes instruction in the four modalities of listening, speaking, reading and writing.  Students are placed  in flexible groups according to their proficiency levels and move based upon teacher evaluation.  For K-5 students who score  within the Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding proficiency levels we continue to provide them support through the use  of guided reading materials and embedding ELL supports into our ELA curriculum, ReadyGen Bi-literacy K-5, and Expeditionary  3-5, as well as other guided reading and grade level texts.  Students are placed in dynamic groups based upon instructional  levels and proficiency.  Students work in small groups to receive the maximum support and guided practice.     All our TB classes participate in Compass Learning/Odyssey, a computer based program for language acquisition, English  phonics and a vast amount of reading material in science and social studies for the building of content knowledge with built-in  supports for the second language learner.    All students in grades K-5 TB classes receive mathematics instruction using the Go Math! curriculum in Spanish. Students in  grades 3-5 use Spanish mathematics computer software programs.  All 3-5 grade students in TB classes participate in the New  York State Mathematics assessments in Spanish.     The content areas of Social Studies and Science are presented to the children in English using ENL methodologies in our K-5 TB  and ENL  classes.  The students' instruction in science and social studies is taught in six week content cycles. The first cycle is  social studies and the second cycle is science.  Classroom teachers use a variety of instructional approaches to provide ELL  students with access to the curriculum, i.e. realia, photographs, process charts, word walls and shared reading and discussion.     Our ENL program is organized as an integrated program  for grades K-5.  Self-Contained ENL classes  have been established in  grades K, and 2-4.  The teachers are ENL and Common Branch certified and incorporate ENL methodologies and strategies in  their instruction.   They utilize the materials from the reading programs, Ready-Gen for K-2, Expeditionary Learning for 3- 5,  along with the Trophies Hartcourt ELL  component, Spotlight on English, as well as trade books.     The math program, Go Math! is a program which allows for high student engagement through the use of virtual manipulatives,  a hands on approach, math discussions, and activities which provide multiple opportunities for deep conceptual understanding  of mathematics.  In addition, the program uses lots of visuals and it has a Language Support component for ELL  students.  Math resources are available in the home language of Spanish.     The writing program incorporates Step Up to Writing strategies.  Step Up to Writing provides the structure that ELL students  need to effectively communicate through the modality of writing. Step Up to Writing equips teachers with effective, multi- sensory writing strategies, aiming to improve the students' writing, reading, listening, and speaking skills.  ENL teachers  support the writing curriculum by using Step Up to Writing to work with students in differentiated groups to meet the  objectives and expectations for each unit of study.  Teachers have received professional development on the use of these   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      materials.  The teacher groups children according to instructional levels and language proficiency levels.  Instruction is  differentiated based upon teacher assessment and student performance.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   We have several methods through which we ensure that our ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home language.  During  the initial screening, the Spanish LAB is useful in providing information about language dominance and home language literacy  proficiency.  Our Spanish speaking ELLs who are entitled to home language testing are assessed using IDEL, Fountas and Pinnell  Running Record Benchmark Assessments in Spanish,  interim and periodic assessments in Spanish and unit tests.  End of Unit  Assessment in Spanish, as well as, the ELE are provided as summative assessments. Teachers analyze data nd plan instruction  that includes necessary scaffolds to ensure student progress. The school has a partnership with the New York Public Library,  the technology program myOn, and is constantly seeking texts that can be used to support students in their native language.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    5a.   In order to accommodate SIFE children, the student’s academic level in their native language is assessed using running  records and the Multilingual Literacy SIFE screener.  Based upon these results and teacher analysis, we develop an academic  intervention program for the child based upon their academic level and age.  The student is placed with students of the same  age and receives small group or individual instruction by our ENL/ ELL intervention teachers and the classroom teacher.  The  student receives instruction in Estrellita to become fluent in Spanish phonics.  Targeted intervention programs for our SIFE  students in mathematics, ELA, and other content areas are provided by our ENL, AIS, RTI and Bilingual staff during the day and  during our after school program. The child is given opportunities to use technology, i.e. NLA and Mathematics in Spanish and  computer-based literacy ENL programs including Compass Learning Odyssey.  Our goal is to maintain the child in the correct  grade group and engage the child on his/her instructional level using age appropriate materials.     5b.   In order to accommodate ELLs with less than 3 years in school, it is important to accommodate the social-emotional  needs that come with being in a new educational experience. Aside from the inclusion modifications of partnering students  that is more familiar with the school culture and language, our school provides many clubs and activities before and after  school that allow students to acclimate to their new experience. Also it is important to provide newcomers with substantial  support and rigorous instruction to prepare them for the testing which they are required to take after one year.  Newcomer  ELLs receive intervention as determined by the students’ needs in mathematics, ELA, and other content areas.  These services  are provided by ENL, AIS, RTI and Bilingual staff during the day and during our extended day program.  Students in TB classes  are given differentiated instruction to sustain native language literacy growth and support acquisition of the second language.  Students in the ENL program receive the required minutes of ENL instruction through small group and differentiated  instruction by our ENL staff.     5c.    In order to accommodate ELLs with 4-6 years of service, we continue to provide rigorous academic instruction, specified  according to each student’s needs and proficiency level.  Students continue to receive the required minutes of ENL and NLA  instruction through small group, differentiated instruction.  Students with 4-6 years of service are targeted for intervention  based on student needs, focusing on improving reading comprehension, fluency and writing (including Compass Learning  Odyssey).     5d.   Long term ELLs are provided with rigorous academic instruction and continue to receive ENL services as per their  language proficiency level.  In addition, our RTI and AIS staff provides these students with specific intervention focusing on the  modality or modalities which data reveals as a weakness for these students.      5e. In order to continue supporting those former ELLs which have tested at a Proficient level,  we provide the mandated ENL  services of 90 minutes on integrated ENL as outlined in CR Part 154 and ensure that teachers continue to implement ELL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      strategies although the students have mainstreamed into a monolingual classroom setting.  To differentiate within the  classroom, teachers offer transitional support to these students by having them lead small group instruction in book clubs  where they hone questioning skills, paraphrasing and summarizing skills. These also allows them to model for lower English  proficient students and often support their content knowledge.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL students with disabilities are monitored by our Language Proficiency Team.  If the committee feels the child requires  additional support services, a referral is initiated.  In the meantime, the child receives at-risk services by our bilingual IEP  teacher, AIS teacher and ENL staff.   Students receive support services in ELA, mathematics, and content.  They also have  access to computer based programs in literacy and mathematics.  Our ELL students who are in Self Contained Special  Education classes receive instruction modified as indicated on their IEP.  These children use the same core material as the rest  of their peers.  In addition, students may receive academic intervention and Speech services as mandated on their IEP by  bilingual staff.  Key standards from the Common Core are emphasized within the abilities of the student and cognitive tasks are  kept as rigorous as the child’s disability will allow.  Use of instructional strategies and grade level material which provides  access to academic content areas and which help to accelerate these ELLs’ lag in academic language and cognition are  employed.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school uses curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to meet the needs of our ELL- SWDs in the least restrictive  environment.  Many of the ELLs from Self-Contained classes are mainstreamed for either reading, math, the content areas or  physical education where they are exposed to academic language with peers.  We have monolingual CTT classes in grades K- 5.  ELLs in these classes are in the least restrictive environment for the whole length of their day, except for speech, OT or  PT.  The ENL teacher along with the  Common Branch Teacher is able to provide their services along with the other ELLs in their  classrooms.  Thus, with two or three teachers in the classroom at one time, flexible groupings are attained.  All of these CTT  classes provide the same rigorous instruction in the Common Core as their regular counterparts.  Fortunately, the Self  Contained special education and CTT classes grades 3-5 are adept at using their Smartboards to scaffold and enhance the  different learning styles of their students through various software, internet sites, writing partnerships and the like.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, Math and content areas are provided to the different ELL subgroups.  Our SIFE  and newcomer students receive instruction in Estrellita to become fluent in Spanish phonics during the school day.  All of our  ELL students are given opportunities to use technology, i.e. HLA and Mathematics in Spanish and computer-based literacy ENL  programs.  ELL students in the ENL program receive small group instruction in English focusing on English Language Arts and  Writing during instructional day.  Students with IEPs receive the services designated by their IEP, in the language designated on  the IEP.   We target vocabulary development so that students can increase academic language.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      The 16-17 NYS ELA and Math scores reveal that 5.4% of ELLs tested scored at or below 25th percentile and scored a level 1 or 2  in ELA while only 4% of ELLs tested scored at or below 25th percentile and scored a level 1 or 2 in Math.  While 16-17  NYSESLAT data reveals that 11.8% of NYSESLAT test takers achieved a Commanding proficiency level.  In order to ensure that  performance by ELLs on NYS ELA and Math assessment is aligned to NYSESLAT results, the Bilingual Teachers Professional  Learning Team will work closely with our MFSB ELL Consultant on our goal focused on increasing academic conversation across  content areas. We are also implementing the Word Generation program in grades 4 and 5 for academic language  development.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Currently, our existing programs will continue.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.  They are invited to attend our after school program to receive  differentiated small group instruction.     This year we are initiating a Native Spanish Language after-school program for those students who would like to enrich their  language use by honing their reading and writing in Spanish.  Research shows that developing literacy in the native language  and bilingual literacy in general promotes greater cognition and higher order thinking skills.  Also, preservation of the home  language and nurturing of bilingualism is known to expand depth of knowledge.     In addition, the school implements 2 After-school and 2 Saturday programs that specifically designed to provide ELLs with  instruction based on their individual needs.  As revealed by our 16-17 NYSESLAT data most of our students struggle with the  writing and speaking modality portion of the assessment, therefore the after-school programs will focus on Non-Fiction  writing. The ELL after-school program will target students who have not made any gains on the 16-17 NYSESLAT. The ELL  Saturday Academy will focus on providing ELLs with an Entering Language Proficiency an opportunity to receive additional ENL  instruction and language acquisition.     Our ELL students are also included in other programs hosted by the school, such as the Enrichment Academy and Saturday  Club and Academics Program.  The Assistant Principals meet with teachers and based on performance data, ELLs are invited to  participate in the program that is aligned to the students needs.  The school’s goal is to ensure that all ELLs are invited to  participate in a program throughout the year.  Invitations are sent to parents in English and in the parent’s home  language.  The parent coordinator and family worker assist in the process by contacting parents that do not respond.     Our ELLs participate in many clubs, activities and programs that are available to all students in school such as National Dance  Institute, Swim for Life, ballroom dancing, chess club, Music in the Brain, Yeshiva science START program, technology club,  sketch club, yoga, martial arts, basketball, baseball and dance.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The TB classes use the A+ Common Core Spanish Literacy Kits which inclused works in various genres and Science and Social  Studies informational texts.  Our work with the CCSS has initiated a more thematically-based curriculum using trade books and  adding more non-fiction texts.  Also, our emphasis on leveled independent reading is adding a focus to grade level texts  through shared reading and read alouds.  This is due to the fact that many of our ELLs cannot read grade level material  independently, but need to be exposed to it and to participate both orally and in writing with grade-level text.  The  instructional practices that support this type of literacy model include whole class and small groups, word study, read aloud,  guided reading, shared reading and accountable talk, conferencing, book clubs, modeled writing, and guided writing and  strategy lessons.  There is an emphasis on frequent formal and informal assessments in the native language, Spanish, as well as  English.  Students are assessed using DIBELS, Fountas and Pinnell Running Record Benchmark Assessments in Spanish and  English,  and unit tests and interim assessments.  Also, students receive native language instruction in literacy using Authentic Texts, Trade Books and units of study from Step  Up to Writing.  Students complete performance based assessments and receive guided reading instruction in their native  language.  Materials used include Spanish guided reading books and Spanish language literature.  Students are grouped for  instruction based upon their instructional level in Spanish.  Groups are dynamic and students move in and out of groups  depending upon teacher evaluation.  These groups are flexible to allow for maximum support to children and their academic  growth.  Teacher assessments used include: interim assessments, Running Records assessments, and informal teacher  observations and conferences.  Students have access to HLA computer software programs in their classroom.  For the ENL component of the Transitional Bilingual program we use Spotlight by Santillana in grades K-5.  This program is used  for children who score in the beginning and low intermediate proficiency level.  The program is based upon social studies   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72      themes and includes instruction in the four modalities of listening, speaking, reading and writing.  Students are placed in  flexible groups according to their proficiency levels and move based upon teacher evaluation.  For K-5 students who score in  the upper intermediate and advanced proficiency levels we use guided reading materials and embedded ELL supports in  ReadyGen Bi-Literacy and Expeditionary programs, as well as other guided reading and grade level texts.  Students are placed  in dynamic groups based upon instructional levels and proficiency.  Students work in small groups to receive the maximum  support and guided practice.  Our second through fifth grade TB classes participate in Compass Learning/Odyssey, a computer  based ESL program for language and content area vocabulary acquisition.   All students in grades K-5 TB classes receive instruction in GO Math in Spanish.  Students in TB classes in grades 3-5 use Spanish  mathematics computer software programs. All 3-5 grade students in TB classes participate in the New York State Mathematics  assessments in Spanish.     The content areas of Social Studies and Science are presented to the children in English using ENL methodologies in our K-5 TB  classes.  Best practices are evidenced in the classroom environment: process charts, content charts, word wall, alphabet  charts, classroom libraries.  The literacy curriculum provides scaffolds for instruction of ELLs that guides teachers in meeting the ELL student's needs  according to their English language proficiency. The guides provides examples of how to apply the New Language Arts  Progressions to the curriculum. The examples include instructions for teachers, actions for students, and additional resources  to facilitate implementing each scaffolding technique.  Step Up to Writing is used in grades K-5 to provide the structure that ELL students need to effectively communicate through  the modality of writing.  Step Up to Writing provides teachers with effective, multi-sensory writing strategies, aiming to  improve the students’ writing, reading, listening, and speaking skills.   All students receive instruction using GoMath in the allocated language of instruction.  The materials are available in Spanish  and English. All 3-5 grade students participate in the New York State Mathematics assessments.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is provided in each model.  In TB classes, native language instruction is delivered in literacy and  math.  Students receive instruction in Estrellita to become fluent in Spanish phonics.  In literacy, students complete unit  portfolio pieces and receive guided reading instruction in their native language.  Materials used include Spanish guided reading  books and Spanish language literature.  Students are grouped for instruction based upon their instructional level in  Spanish.  Groups are dynamic and students move in and out of groups depending upon teacher evaluation.  These groups are  flexible to allow for maximum support to children and their academic growth.  Teacher assessments used include:  Performance Based Assessments and Unit Tests, Running Records assessments, and informal teacher observations and  conferences.  Students have access to HLA computer software programs in their classroom.  There is an emphasis on frequent  formal and informal assessments in the native language, Spanish.  Students are assessed using IDEL, Fountas and Pinnell  running records in Spanish and on-demand performance tasks.  All students in grades K-5 TB classes receive instruction in GO  Math in Spanish.  Students in grades 3-5 use Spanish mathematics computer software programs. All 3-5 grade students  participate in the New York State Mathematics assessments in Spanish.  The content areas of Social Studies and Science are  presented to the children in English using ESL methodologies in our K-5 TB classes.  Best practices evidenced in the classroom  environment include; process charts, content charts, word wall, alphabet charts, classroom libraries and evidence of student  work.  Classes follow the NYCDOE mandates for color coding of language use.   Home Language Support is delivered in self-contained and integrated ENL programs as needed to facilitate the transference of  the students’ academic skills and knowledge to English.  Content-based vocabulary and academic language is reinforced  through the use of cognates and instructional strategies that help transfer comprehension and phonetic skills from their native  language to English. Glossaries are used as a resource to support the home language, as well as books in students' home  language.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    ELL students’ receive their required services and these services support the students’ needs to acquire proficiency in English  and achieve academic growth on their grade level.  ELLs are served in classes by grade level, except for Self Contained Special  Education classes. The resources used in monolingual and bilingual classrooms correspond to the ELLs’ ages and grade levels,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73      as do the resources used by our ESL, AIS and required services staff.   With the help of Smartboards in Grades 3-5, students are  taught in a developmentally appropriate manner using high interest materials for lower level readers, engaging lessons,  software, and exposure to the key standards of the Common Core.  The TB classes use the ReadyGen Bi-Literacy which includes works in various genres and Science and Social Studies  informational texts.  Our work with the CCSS has initiated a more thematically-based curriculum using trade books and adding  more non-fiction texts.

If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our school is not co-located.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Our school assists newly enrolled ELL students throughout the school year in a variety of ways.  If the newly enrolled ELL  student was on our register at the end of the year, that student is invited to attend our ELL summer school program designed  to foster academic growth and increase English language.       17.

(Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional Development and Support for School Staff  High-quality and ongoing professional development for teachers, principals, and paraprofessionals (and, where appropriate,  pupil services personnel, parents, and other staff) to enable all children at PS189 to meet the State’s student academic  standards.  The following Professional Development plan is in place for our staff to support ELL performance:  •          Professional Learning Teams in grades K-2 review their ongoing analysis of running records  •          Professional Learning Teams grades K-5 study and align the reading, writing and content area Common Core State  Standards with New York State and City standards and New Language Arts Progressions    •          Professional Learning Teams grades 3-5 develop Performance based Tasks and Assessment exemplars to address the  writing proficiency needs of ELL students; mainly the development and organization of writing pieces    •          All Teachers in grades 3-5 integrate speaking and listening components from the Core Standards into peer and class  discussions, focusing on sharing information and opinions utilizing specific Thinking Routines from Making Thinking Visible               Math Coach provides support to bilingual and monolingual teachers in the rigorous implementation of NYC core  mathematics program and Common CoreMath Learning  Standards  including: Math Exemplars, Math Conferences and unit  instructional and assessment timelines    •          Literacy Coach provides support to bilingual and monolingual teachers in the rigorous implementation of NYC core  reading program and Common Core Learning Standards  including: Performance Tasks, Performance Tasks Assessments,  Interim Assessments and unit instructional and assessment timelines    •          Bilingual teachers participate in a Professional Learning Team which includes MFSB ELL Consultant focusing on  increasing academic conversations across the content areas.    •         In addition, our special education teachers attend professional development in IEP goal writing and implementation.   We have used time for training during our professional development days, during our PLTs and also during school time.  Since  our school has a large number of ELLs, we are constantly trying to meet their needs to help them be successful.  The ELL  Supervisor  works closely with the Professional Development Committee to ensure that 15 % of total professional  development hours for all teachers and 50% of the professional development for ENL and Bilingual teachers is specific to the  needs of ELLs. , including:  K-3 bilingual teachers will receive training on Estrellita Reading Program.

Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our guidance counselors and assistant principals are knowledgeable and up-to-date on the various choices and preparations  that ELL students as they transition from the elementary to middle school setting.  The assistant principals and guidance  counselors assist students and parents with the application process, and facilitate the attendance to fairs and visits to  prospective schools.  Teachers provide our 5th grade ELL students with a rigorous curriculum to prepare them for a successful  middle school academic transition.  The ENL teachers will attend Professional Development on ELL strategies in a middle  school content area curriculum and turn-key the information in the upper grade professional learning team.    As stated above, the ELL Supervisor works closely with the Professional Development Committee to ensure that 15 % of total  professional development hours for all teachers and 50% of the professional development for ENL and Bilingual teachers is  specific to the needs of ELLs.  In addition, we recruit the services of an ELL Specialist consultant to provide our non ENL, non  bilingual licensed staff receives a ELL specific professional development in the following areas:  social and academic language;  the role of the first language in second language acquisition vocabulary development for ELLs strategies for the teaching of  reading and writing to second language learners use of technology with comprehensible input to support second language  learning Conferencing in reading and writing, and guided reading and best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating  language and content instruction    We have used time for training during our professional development days, during our PLTs and also ensuring that our school  schedule includes two common/collaborative planning periods for each grade during school time.  Since our school has a large  number of ELLs, we are constantly trying to meet their needs to help them be successful in their academic  careers.  Professional Development agendas and attendance sheets are kept on file in a binder in both the main office and the  ESL Supervisor’s office.     An ELL Specialist consultant provides our non ENL, non bilingual licensed staff receives a minimum of 5.5 hours in ELL specific  professional development in the following areas:   social and academic language; the role of the first language in second language acquisition  vocabulary development for ELLs strategies for the teaching of reading and writing to second language learners use of  technology with comprehensible input to support second language learning  Conferencing in reading and writing, and guided reading.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   P.S. 189 provides many opportunities for parents to be involved in their child’s education and become a part of the school  community.  Open House for all grades are held in September to inform parents of school and regional policies, procedures  and mandates. In addition, as part of CR part 154.2 requirements,  parents of ELLs are invited to attend a special  annual meeting, beginning in January, where they are informed of programs pertaining to students’ needs, language  proficiency assessment results using the NYSESLAT parent report and language development progress using a checklist of the  speaking and listening standards.  To further address the needs of our parents and to promote ongoing communication  between them and the school, we offer translation services in several languages.  Our Parent Coordinator and Parent Leaders  translate English-Spanish documents as necessary.  Additionally, we have new computer software which enables office staff  and others to translate.  When needed, we avail ourselves of translators and interpreters from the DOE Vendor List.  In the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76            recent past, we have had Korean, Chinese and Arabic translators for parents, teachers and students.        2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  The Parent Coordinator fosters a welcoming school environment for parents and is instrumental in organizing parent workshop  and activities that help support the school’s educational program.  Weekly workshops on curriculum, parenting, and life skills  are offered to all parents.  Monthly PTA meetings are scheduled and highly attended by the parents. Our school partners with  community based organizations to offer on site adult ESL classes for beginner and intermediate levels and Citizenship classes.  All meetings and correspondence are provided in English and Spanish, including monthly school newsletters and calendars that  list all the ongoing workshops, meetings and events. These participation meetings, events and classes take place during and  after the school day and on Saturdays.  Parents are members on many school committees, including the School Leadership  Team, Safety Committee and Learning Leaders Volunteer Program.  Furthermore, parents are involved in fundraising activities  to support student events and resources for the school.    All parents are encouraged to attend parent orientations for newly enrolled ELL students to learn about the program their  student will be enrolled in and the academic, attendance and behavior expectations for the students in the school.  These  sessions are conducted by the ELL Supervisor.  In addition, the Parent Coordinator and Family Worker reach out to parents to  inform them of the various parent workshops held through out the school year.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS189                                                                              School DBN: 06M189  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The school reviews data supplied by parents on Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS). Parents  indicate which language they wish to receive written and oral communication. This information is recorded in ATS.  The parent also completes the written translation and oral interpretation information on the student emergency  card. The student personnel secretary is responsible to print and distribute notices in the various languages and  distribute to families as they have indicated on these documents. The school's translation and oral interpretation  needs are primarily in English and Spanish. 99% of our population indicate they speak one of these 2 primary  languages. 1% of parents speak a different primary language. Among these are, Arabic, and Chinese. However,  these families prefer to receive written information in English.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80     2.

School translation and interpretation information is also provided to  parents during the initial intake at registration, during Parent Teacher Association (PTA) meetings, and School  Leadership Team (SLT) meetings. Parents are enabled and encouraged to access the administrative offices despite  language differences. The school does not have any language that is not included in the primary languages translated  by the Translation and Interpretation Unit.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       The school distributes parent surveys to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services. The  Language lines will be used, during individual meetings, to gather this information for languages other than English  and Spanish. At this time parents are satisfied with the structures implemented to provide them with translation and  interpretation services.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          83
