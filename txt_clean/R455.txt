This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Tottenville High School is a comprehensive high school located on Staten Island intentionally designed for student  exploration and preparation for various careers. All students who attend THS will develop the critical and creative  thinking skills necessary to graduate college and learn necessary professional skills for all careers. Students will   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      succeed both academically and socially through the implementation of our integrated curriculum and core values of  responsibility, respect, scholarship and service.   Our mission is to engage students in the academic rigor needed to guarantee a quality education for all children  ranging from those who struggle to learn to the most gifted. Partnerships with organizations will provide additional  support such as internships or professional development and offer other available resources to further assist our  school in preparing graduates to excel in their post-secondary education and chosen career. Our student focused  programs of study will foster the academic and personal excellence necessary to meet or exceed state and common  core standards as well as promote productive members of society who respect diversity, value differences and  demonstrate the ability to adapt and prosper in the ever-changing world around them.    THS faculty and partners understand the challenges faced in supporting the individual needs of all learners and pledge  as a school community to provide each child with the personalized attention necessary to reach their education  potential and emotional maturity.    Our mission will deliver unique learning opportunities, direct and consistent involvement with our collaborating  community partners and application of high standards for everyone as the foundation of our educational programs  and extracurricular activities.                      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Tottenville High School uses multiple data-sets to assess our school community’s performance, specifically mining  data from our quality review, state report card, scholarship data for credit accumulation, Regents results and teacher  observations. After a careful review of student performance and teacher evaluations, our area of focus will continue  to be achieving student centered learning and accountability. Tottenville High School strives to embolden an  empowered learner.   Curricula are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards or to specific career or college approved standards such  as Advanced Placement (AP) and Career and Technical Education (CTE). We’ve made great strides towards the  emphasis of inculcating rigorous habits and observable higher order thinking skills through creation of innovative  interdisciplinary Performance Tasks. Additionally, in school year 2017-2018, we offered 17 different Advanced  Placement courses, with over 1000 students and 66 Career and Technical Education courses, with nearly 900 students  enrolled. In 2017-2018, 858 students were scheduled to take at least one AP exam and 1805 AP exams were  scheduled to be administered. Eligible students continue to be scheduled to take NOCTI exams.   The weekly house structure and the daily common planning times have enhanced coherence across departments and  within subjects. While school and class assessments provide feedback to students and teachers regarding student  achievement, the quality of actionable feedback to students and teachers varies across departments within the  school.    Though instruction across classrooms evidenced Danielson aligned strategies and overwhelmingly ensures all students  are engaged in rigorous tasks and higher order thinking skills, in some classes the opportunities for students to  demonstrate these skills are limited, this years' renewed focus on student centric inquiry based learning intends to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      change that. Tottenville High School will continue to refine our systems of actionable feedback and strive to ensure  that all students and faculty feel supported in their continuous improvement efforts.   Tottenville High school offers rigorous Institute programs in Science and Humanities, as well as, Honors Programs,  extensive Advanced Placement Courses, College Now Courses affiliated with the College of Staten Island, St. John’s  University and Kingborough College.

Tottenville also proudly continues our innovative partnership with Wagner college to provide a seamless entry  into Wagner's specialized programs.   Tottenville High School is committed to increasing our graduation rate and lowering our dropout rate by developing  multiple options for students to earn their High School diplomas. Among these meaningful options are the housing of  the Young Adult Borough Center here at Tottenville. The YABC accepts overage and under-credited students. The  Pathways to Graduation Program was implemented for the students who qualified to earn the Test Assessing  Secondary Completion (TASC degree) through the Department of Education's District 79.    Tottenville High School will continue to fully utilize technology; in terms of one-to-one programs like Aleks and  Achieve3000 and in terms of intentional and regular use of technology as an integral part of classroom practice. This  has been facilitated by the school's investment in Chromebooks, iPads and increasing use of multiple and newly  acquired computer carts.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Tottenville High School is a comprehensive academic high school of approximately 3,900 students with a strong  school culture. Dedicated to providing exemplary education to all in a supportive environment, all students;  academically gifted students, reluctant to learn learners (typically referred to as the “lowest third”), students with  disabilities, English Language Learners and the middle third of dedicated learners are all supported through the  provision of customized learning experiences to help them achieve a growth mindset and establish a strong  foundation for continued success.   Tottenville continues to register almost a quarter of the student population in AP for All for the 2018/2019 academic  year. These students are made up a broad cross section of students; Institute, Honors, General Education, Students  with IEPs, ELLs or former ELLs. As a learning community we are committed to building our capacity to serve all  students more inclusively.    Specially Designed Instruction (SDI) is defined in 34 CFR (Regulations of the Commissioner of Education)to mean:  "adapting, as appropriate to the needs of an eligible student, the content, methodology, or delivery of instruction to  address the unique needs that result from the student's disability; and to ensure access to the student to the general  curriculum, so that he or she can meet the educational standards that apply to all students." In practice, Tottenville  teachers are embedding SDI in the pedogological practices of the school by the intentional and purposeful planning of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      instruction to ensure that students with disabilities can meaningfully access, participate and progress in the general  education curriculum.   We are cultivating an ethos of 360 support for all of our students, with an emphasis this year on our Lowest Third. We  will accomplish this through continued investment in our teaching staff via customized development of training by  establishing, in conjunction with the United Federation of Teachers, a Teacher Center within our building.    We recognize that students need to connect with each other and with their teachers before they learn. The School- based Professional development committee intends to infuse social and emotional elements into training which  acknowledges the critical importance of developing students' emotional and social skills.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   In the 2017-2018 school year, Tottenville High School continued to show remarkable growth in the areas of improved  Instruction to motivate our learners . As a result, the emphasis on college readiness saw significant gains, as indicated  by our near record-breaking year of college acceptances and scholarships earned. Tottenville High School will  continue efforts to increase consistency across classrooms and alignment to the Common Core Standards through the  addition of a Teacher Center to our school organization.    We have demonstrated our commitment to our people with the introduction of the Teacher Center to Tottenville.  This will assist in cultivating a culture that values and develops individuals and teams. The Teacher Center will assist in  the design of rigorous instruction and will allow meaningful and productive work to continue in a non evaluative  environment. The House organization will work in conjunction with the Teacher Center and afford the use of  frequent, informal and formal inter-visitations by peers, lead teachers and supervisors-allowing for multiple exposures  to best pedagogy.    Teacher assistants will be more fully integrated into our professional development structure ensuring continuity with  partnering with our parents and making sure that the work goes in both directions Parents will be leveraged to  reinforce methods in the classroom at home and finally, our students' work itself, will continue to be showcased  throughout the year at school events and regularly throughout school reinforcing our culture of excellence.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 31R455   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   3808   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Tottenville uses a variety of data sources to assess a student's performance, specifically mining data from our state  report card, scholarship data for credit accumulation, Regents results and teacher observations. Additionally, through  review of the Learning Environment Survey and teacher evaluations, we identified a disconnect between faculty's  perception that classes were rigorous and students' perceptions that classes were not rigorous. Our area of focus will  continue towards more fully achieving rigorous, specially designed student-centric learning activities. This will better  enable students themselves to provide each other meaningful and measurable feedback while self-directing their own  learning creating a rigorous and rewarding learning community.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, a cohort of students, who comprise a portion of the lowest third, will increase the literacy skill of  synthesizing texts by three skill levels through engaging in rigorous student centered learning. This will be measured by  use of programs such as Achieve3000, Mock Regents results and benchmark reading level assessments.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Key Personnel  Who is responsible  for implementing  and overseeing the  activity/strategy?     Evidence-based instructional programs,      professional development, and/or systems and  structures needed to impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other  high-need student subgroups (e.g.,  overage/under-credited, SIFE, STH).   A selected subgroup of students in the lowest third will be  given a baseline, a mid-term and a final reading test to  determine their initial, mid-point progress and final lexile  level. Quantitative (benchmark assessments) and  qualitative (observations from periodic learning walks) will  be collected and discussed.       Tottenville will transform outcomes through the promotion  of rigorous, specially designed, student centered activities.    An emphasis on project based, student centric learning will  be embedded throughout the School’s Professional  Development Calendar.    Feedback on learning is an essential element of a rich  instructional environment and to assist students towards  achieving their academic potential. Teachers will  demonstrate, as evidenced by 85% of teachers receiving an  HE or E in their MOTP for 3D, of their use of timely,  constructive and systematized (for example, Google  Classroom, or consistent use of interdisciplinary rubric).  This feedback should be actionable providing students  concrete next steps with guidance they need to improve  their performance. At least 80% of these students will self- report that they find their classes to be rigorous on the  Learning Environment Survey and the mid-year Wellness  Check (a survey developed and administered by the school).  Students themselves will be observed providing each other  meaningful and measurable feedback while self-directing  their own learning.    Innovative student-centric programs showcased through  periodic learning walks, will continue to foster student  academic development. Departments will endeavor to  create dynamic programs for parents and the surrounding  community. Students will be engaged through powerful  individualized curriculum reinforced by thoughtful practice   Lowest Third  September 2018-  May 2019   Administration and  teaching faculty   Kid-Talk occurs  one Monday a  month and  involves  Guidance, Deans,  Teachers and  Paraprofessionals.

On going self-assessments within multiple school committees; Safety, Attendance, Pupil Personnel Team, Consultative  Committee, School Professional Development Committee, Cabinet and the School Leadership Team, during which a  series of questions was explored; what evidence is present that we have a welcoming school culture for all students,  that we've set high expectations for everyone, that we actively keep all students engaged in school and that we  actively pursue every point of contact with all families of our students? Where we see shortcomings, primarily that  students self-identified that they do not feel universally engaged across all classes and they do not feel universally  that their emotional intelligence is supported, we will target improvement of faculty and staff responsiveness to  students' needs. Attendance and performance data was reviewed and students were solicited for their input. Based  on this inquiry process, the decision was to focus on improving students' positive impressions of Tottenville as a truly  supportive environment by focusing on training faculty and staff in pedagogy of cultivating student engagement  through student centric inquiry learning and on methods to enhance and develop students' emotional intelligence.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36     State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. TOTTENVILLE HS, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      TOTTENVILLE HS will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

We have found ELLs to have the most difficulty  with Science (Living Environment and Earth Science) and History (U.S. and Global). This is due  to the difficulty with reading and comprehension.    The Tottenville ENL program is currently implementing a new online literacy program entitled  Imagine Learning.  Since many students are enrolling with much lower lexile levels than  necessary to meet the demands of high school level work (e.g. 2nd and 3rd grade reading levels),  this program will provide the fundamentals necessary for them to enhance their English literacy  while also engendering active language production within the form of games.  Initially, Imagine  Learning provides a transitional phase in which all prompts, directions, and new vocabulary are  read in the students native language by native speakers, thus further assisting the students with  language acquisition and phonemic awareness via their L1.  All data is documented instantly on  the cloud, and reports are generated constantly to analyze students’ growth and to provide the  teacher with instant remedial lessons and support for skill specific deficiencies.  Before School Program:  With our Title III Funds we offer  ELL Science Tutoring in both Living Environment and Earth  Science in English prior to start of our school day.  These classes are offered to both our current  ELLs and our formal ELL population.  These classes offer academic vocabulary, concepts and  hands on lessons to ensure academic success in all the areas of science.   These classes support  the Living Environment and Earth Science curriculum through The Common Core Learning  Standards.  Virtual Learning books, CDs and DVDs have been purchased with Title III funds to  support our ELL population.  The Science Title III Tutoring will begin in December of 2018 and  continue throughout the school year to June of 2019.  It will start up again for the 2019/2020  school year.  After School Program:  Global and U.S. History tutoring is available after school on Tuesday, Wednesday and  Thursday.  It is restricted to ELLs and Former ELLs.  These classes offer academic vocabulary,  concepts and hands on lessons in alliance with The Common Core Learning  Standards.  Glossaries, dictionaries and Native Language textbooks are used to support our  ELLs.  These classes run from October 16, 2018 through June 4, 2019.  It will continue  throughout the 2019/2020 school year.   ELLs that are in E.N.L. longer than three years (long-term E.L.L.s) have supplementary  instruction before and/or after school that focus on listening/speaking and  reading/writing.  Tutoring is also offered preparing students for the Regents.  We also offer  college prep courses through our Guidance Department and Beacon Program.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   These programs will benefit all ELLs (Long Term and SWD) in all grades (9-12).   Native  language supports are provided in both programs.  Professional Development will be offered  through aforementioned companies and turn keyed to appropriate staff.  Records of attendance (student) and program notifications to parents, in the preferred languages  (electronically)  are maintained with the Assistant Principal of ENL, Marie Granite, Ms. Jean  Scire and  Mr. Sacco (ENL teachers)  All Title III tutoring is conducted in English with native language supports.  International Cultural Festival will highlight our diversity and promote cultural understanding  within the Tottenville community.   Students of various backgrounds will have the opportunity to share their culture with Tottenville  through music, performance, dance, food, visual art, etc. A group of students will facilitate the  process, creating performances and decorations, running the logistics of the event, and preparing  food. These students will educate parents, staff, and their fellow students about their  backgrounds. This ties into NSLL standards 2.1 and 2.2, as well as 5.1, as the festival will  hopefully inspire people outside the school setting, and will certainly take place outside the  classroom.   Preparing the event will allow students to engage in Student to Student discussion, to design their  own performance tasks, and to train each other and their teachers. This will allow students to  take ownership of their education, and that of others. Just as importantly, it will allow English  Language Learners to take the lead, as they are the experts on their own cultures. As students  will be able to choose how they want to present their culture, they will be able to demonstrate  their expertise in ways that make them comfortable.  Logistics: Committee of interested students will be created by November. Many, but not all, will  come from Global Perspectives group. Those students will reach out to existing cultural clubs, as  well as students of different backgrounds who may not have clubs yet. Students will create ways  to present their culture. Ideally, we will have 8-12 performances for the stage.  This will be a student centered event. Students will be responsible for making event work. They  will create performances and decorations, and make food. They will organize the cafeteria. They  will run rehearsals. This will allow students to take the lead in our community outreach.

This is why we have incorporated Google Classroom  into our  learning community. Google  has an online learning environment as well as various components  including Google Calendar.  Parents are able to find everything they need to communicate and  collaborate with their children’s school.  They are able to stay informed with calendars, school  programs, sports, activities and PTA newsletters.  Google has the capabilities of translating  languages.  Our Family and Student Handbook has been sent out for translations to advise families of  important school procedures, guidelines and many wonderful activities, programs and  opportunities.  In addition to the Handbook we provide opportunities for all parents to become  familiar with various programs offered in our school by way of PTA meetings, orientation  nights, conferences and workshops.  We offer refreshments at these events. Translators are  always available. Links are maintained with parent leadership and community based  organizations.  Parents will be notified of these events through translated letters and phone calls.    We work closely with groups that serve immigrants, such as El Centro and the New York  Immigration Coalition.  We collaborate with feeder schools and with institutions of higher  education.  We are currently working with The College of Staten Island (CLIP - CUNY  Language Immersion Program) to set a workshop for ELLs and their families.  Field trips to the  New York City Public Library, TD Bank take place with our ELL population and their families,  as well as a cultural trip to Manhattan.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   At Tottenville High School, we have both Stand-Alone and Integrated ESL classes with a content area teacher of  English. Mrs. Scire has an English and TESOL license.  She teaches 9th grade English classes that have  all levels of  ELLs.  Mr. Sacco, a licensed ESL Teacher pushes into a 10th, 11th and 12th grade English classes.  Ms. Granite, pushes  into a 9th grade 15-1 stand alone English class English class with Transitioning and Expanding students and an  Alternate Assessment class with 1 student who is Emerging . These classes are taught with ENL strategies and  methodologies providing language acquisition and vocabulary support.  Mr. Sacco, teaches two stand alone ENL  classes to our Entering and Emerging 9th, 10th  and 12th grade students   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     At this time we do not have a Traditional Bilingual Program.  If we have enough requests, we will open a class.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      At this time, we do not have a Dual Language Program.  If we have enough requests, we will open a program.     2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Based on the CR-Part 154 Requirements for ENL we hold the following classes:        a.

Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   As per CR Part 154, Tottenville High School, delivers a freestanding ENL program model with Native Language supports. In the  freestanding ENL program, beginning and literacy level students. The classes focus on listening/speaking and  reading/writing.  ELLs also take content classes in health education, science, math and social studies with Native Language  supports.  Push In classes are proved to all ELLs in 9-12 grades. ELLs with disabilities are identified as Special Education on the  Individual Education Plan and are programmed for ESL as per their IEP Content area classes are taught in English incorporating  the Common Core Learning Standards and adaptations are made according to the needs of the students.  Teachers are  informed in writing, as to which students are ELLs, their levels (based on the NYSESLAT and/or NYSITELL) and how long they  have been in the country.  They are also advised that they are entitled to extended time on exams, are able to and encouraged  to use glossaries and/or translators.  If possible, students are partnered with other students that speak their native language  which we have called our Student Ambassador Program.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   To date Tottenville does not have a Bi-lingual or Dual Language program.  If we get 20 parents in the same language that want  said referenced classes, will start a program.  Regents Exams offered 3 times a year  for Math, History and Science  are offered  in Chinese, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Hatian Creole.        5.

ELL’s are provided with additional assistance in literacy,  mathematics, science and other content area programs by participating in remedial courses.  Flexible programming is provided  through least restricted environment, academic testing, I.Q. testing, teacher recommendations and previous I.E.P.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  We have decided to implement an after school tutoring program exclusively for ELLs.  The subjects will be U.S. History, Global  History, Living Environment and Earth Science.  Resources, videos, bilingual glossaries  and textbooks have been purchased in  the native languages. All ELLs are able to attend the tutoring which is offered through the Title III program.  Communication  with the content area teachers and the ELL Coordinator are on going, as  is the range of intervention.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on ideas and trends, Tottenville High School will continue to implement MyOn (reader that personalizes reading for  students by recommending books based on their interests, reading level, and ratings of books they've read) and Imagine  Learning ( is an innovative language and literacy software program for ELLs, struggling readers and SPEC ED students.).  Genius  Plaza will be implemented. With Genius Plaza students and their parents take ownership of the lesson by using a co-creation  tool to re-teach the skills using their unique creativity.  Once co-creations are completed, students reflect on each other’s work  by adding comments and/or votes to the best game, video, eBook, or worksheet. This means: repetition, critical thinking, and  mastery.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   At this point in time, Tottenville High School does not have a bilingual program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   All our ELL’s are afforded equal access to all school programs.   Tottenville High School provides a great number of  extracurricular activities such as sports, and various clubs, such as The Coptic Club, The Asian American Association, The  Passport Club, LASO, The Italian Club, and The Sign Language Club.  There are over two hundred different clubs and sports  teams, all of which welcome and encourage the participation of all students including the ELL population. In September during  lunch periods representatives from clubs, teams and various activities are invited to canvas all students including  ELLs.  Because we have a small program, individualized attention is given to all ELLs.  Student Ambassadors (mentors) are  assigned to all new ELLs.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Content area textbooks are purchased (when available) in the native language.  Programs such as Imagine Learning and MyOn  have multiple language capabilites and supports.  Students have a Spanish assist on the Achieve 3000 program.  Magazines,  periodicals, bilingual dictionaries are purchased to help support the native languages for both students and parents. through a  grant we purchased Genius Plaza to assist our ELLs. The Genius Plaza platform removes this obstacle by providing engaging,  practical, research-based curriculum where students are the protagonists of their learning. We bring the best quality education  to communities around the world, providing access to the strongest, culturally relevant math, science and language arts  content offered.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native Language support is delivered through the use of Glossaries, Native Language periodicals, and textbooks when  available.  Achieve 3000 has a Spanish assist.  Lap tops are in the ENL classrooms and are available for students to  borrow.  When possible students are placed with bilingual teachers in the content areas and or CTT classes.  They are usually  paired in content classes with others that speak their native language.  Imagine Learning uses first language capabilities to  assist the students in transferring their knowledge to English.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.      Instruction is delivered in English (target language).

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Tottenville High School is always looking to improve their relationship/communication with students and their  families. This is why we have incorporated a Parent Orientation and Workshop upon arrival. Parents meet with  the Assistant Principal of ENL, Marie Granite, the Parent Coordinator, Connie Assennato and the ELL Guidance  Counselor, Alla Patrick. Home Language surveys are completed by parents. Interpreters are provided if needed.  Parents are surveyed and can request the language they would like both written and oral communication. We use  The NYC DOE’s Translation and Interpretation Unit and or The Big Word (a professional interpretation and  translation service. Parents are able to stay informed with calendars, school programs, sports, activities and PTA  newsletters. We provide opportunities for all parents to become familiar with various programs offered in our   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      School by way of PTA meetings, orientation nights, conferences, workshops. Interpreters are always available. We  offer refreshments at these events. Links are maintained with parent leadership and community based  organizations. In addition, we work closely with groups that serve immigrants such as El Centro, with feeder  schools and with institutions of higher education. Interpreter are always available and accessible.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Language    Written  Preferred    Percent  Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    When a student enters Tottenville High  School from another country, the  student and parent/guardian are  greeted by the Parent Coordinator and  the ESL Coordinator/Teacher. An  informal oral interview is conducted by a  trained pedagogue; the HLIS form is  given. The student and parent are then  interviewed informally by a trained  pedagogue. On staff, we have trained  pedagogues that speak Polish, French,  Spanish, Italian, Russian, Urdu, Punjabi,  Hindi and various other languages. An  interpreter is then provided (if needed in  the target language).
