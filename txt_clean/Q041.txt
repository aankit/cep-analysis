This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At our school, we enjoy a strong community feeling and a warm, nurturing environment. The social-emotional and  academic well-being of our students is paramount. Children are encouraged to explore, achieve and excel. They are  provided with a high level of instruction so that they can meet or exceed learning standards. We seek to instill a love  for lifelong learning.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.S. 41 is a K-5 elementary school located in a residential area directly across from Crocheron Park in Bayside, Queens.  In the 2016-2017 school year we celebrated our centennial - 100 years of proud service to the community. At our  centennial assembly celebration, Council Member Paul Vallone announced that our school will be receiving close to  $3,000,000 in funding toward an electrical upgrade. These improvements are as necessary as they are exciting as we  move into the future. Through other grant awards we were also able to secure approximately $1,000,000 for a total  playground renovation. We expect completion of the playground sometime around the start of the 2019-2020 school  year.    At P.S.41 we also enjoy strong collaborative relationships with parents. Whether it is through a donation of time or  money, attendance at an event, or PTA involvement, our parent body is as outstanding and supportive as a school  could hope for.   All students at P.S.41 also enjoy a range of clusters: music, art, gym, tech, stem (grades 1-5). Our faculty also includes  a psychologist, social worker, 17 paraprofessionals, a parent coordinator, safety officer, two secretaries, and four  school aides.   Each year our science teacher organizes an extraordinary science fair that showcases the work and talents of children  across all grades. 4th and 5th grade students are selected to be engineers and tour guides, for a true student- centered experience.    Children at P.S.41 have many opportunities to engage in the arts including a comprehensive music program. All  students receive music instruction as a part of their general program but our music teacher also facilitates a band and  chorus comprised of students who volunteer to participate. Our music teacher works with the band and chorus to put  on a range of concerts throughout the year. Children in our school also participate in Theater Arts with Alistair King.  He is an outside provider, completely funded by our PTA, who works with children on grade specific performances.  These types of events are frequent at P.S.41.   Additionally, our 5th grade students participate in ballroom dancing lessons paid for by our generous PTA and  provided by Dancing Classrooms. In the past our ballroom dancing competition teams have won gold and silver  trophies for their efforts.   There are many special and unique opportunities/features that we offer at P.S. 41 Q. Parents are always welcome at  the school and are provided with opportunities to engage in a variety of ways including: School Leadership Team,  Curriculum Nights, Speech and Language Nights, IEP Nights, ENL Parent Workshops and more. Parents, children and  teachers also participate in a range of fun and charitable endeavors including raising money for UNICEF, Night of  Giving (Children create stuffed bears and donate them to a local children’s hospital), Anti-bullying assemblies, Lunar  New Year celebration, Halloween Party, Hollyrock Game Show Night, Parent and Child Art Workshops (funded  through the Project Boost grant), APEC visits and trips, School Garden, Hour of Code, Teacher Appreciation luncheon  by parents, Parent Appreciation night by teachers, and district workshops hosted at the school. This past year our  technology teacher presented at the STEM Family Fun Night held at the Queens Hall of Science. This event was open  to all families who wanted to attend, not just those from our school. Last year our science teacher, Lydia Pierides, was  selected from a large pool of candidates to be part of the team that actually re-wrote the citywide scope and  sequence for science. We are quite proud! She has also facilitated several district level and city level workshops for  parents and teachers including a summer institute at Stuyvesant High School, open to all teachers who are interested  in learning more about Next Generation Science Standards and the the launch of the Amplify Science curriculum.  STEAM is very important at 41.   From year to year our PTA plans and executes a huge celebration of the cultures represented in our community. The  event is called International Night. International Night is our biggest, most well-attended annual fund raising event  featuring food and dancing from across a broad range of ethnicities and cultural backgrounds.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Each year we also host a parent-led Career Day where parents come into all of our classrooms and present to children  on the variety of jobs that they hold.   Other notable opportunities at P.S. 41 Q include: Parent Mystery Readers in Kindergarten, enrichment/academic  intervention in reading and math, after school programs, basketball team, SMART Boards in all classrooms, laptop  carts for students, and enrichment clusters in the Renzulli model (children select from a menu of choices that teachers  offer and participate in two cycles of ten weeks each).   At P.S. 41 Q high expectations are very important and something that we have interwoven through our classrooms  with teachers and students. In the 2017-2018 school year we partnered with Columbia Teacher’s College to help  propel our literacy work. We look forward to this continued partnership.    High expectations are also communicated to parents. During PTA meetings and especially SLT meetings, we discuss  the ways in which we are supporting our students and helping them to meet state standards. This is true, not just  across the core academic subjects, but in music and the arts as well. We also often convey the importance of high  expectations when it comes to social development. Anti-bullying assemblies aid in this effort, as does the monthly  public recognition of students who display excellence in citizenship. We also have class parents in every classroom  that disseminate important information in addition to frequent use of the Blackboard “robo call” system where we  are able to make mass phone call announcements to parents. P.S. 41 is well-represented on the web:  www.pta41.com, www.ps41q.com, Twitter @ps41crocheron.   The grounds of P.S. 41 feature a main building where we share space with P993 D75 and a learning center behind the  main building. These are four air-conditioned classrooms that will house kindergarten beginning in September of  2018. We are very excited about this incredible space for children.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We serve approximately 470 students. In the 2018-2019 school year we expect to have the following numbers of  classes: K (3), 1 (3), 2 (2,) 3 (3), 4 (3), 5 (3). We also expect to offer K/1, 2/3 and 4/5 self contained classes as well as a  continuation of our ASD Horizon class in the 1st grade. Students in our school with IEPs (Individualized Education  Programs) receive a range of special education services including ICT (Integrated co-teaching), SETSS (Special  Education Teacher Support Services), occupational therapy (OT), physical therapy (PT), speech and language therapy  and counseling.    Last year we were also able to provide academic intervention and enrichment opportunities, after school, for free. We  would certainly love to do this again, but our decisions going forward, as always, are predicated on whether the  budget will support them.   We also offer specialized after school sessions to our ENL population. So in addition to either 180 or 360 minutes of  ENL instruction per week, these children are invited to attend an after school program where they are provided with  enriching activities to support their growth in acquiring/mastering the English language. This program is always  predicated on whether the budget will support it.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   According to our 2016 Framework for Great Schools Report, P.S. 41Q achieved a score of 95 in "Collaborative  Teachers," which we are quite proud of. Within this section, our survey shows 100% inclusive classroom instruction,  99% school commitment, and 100% on peer collaboration. This not only exceeds the target but exceeds the citywide  average. The other attributes of collaborative teachers were also paramount thus they were also rated highly.  Additionally, we earned scores well above citywide averages in Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment,  Effective School Leadership, Strong Family-Community Ties and Trust.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      In looking at the most recent data regarding Strong Family and Community Ties, our overall score was high at 4.47  (+.34 above the district average and +1.02 above the citywide average). With that, 91% of parents agreed or strongly  agreed that they are invited to visit classrooms to observe instruction. We see this as a focus area. Every year, all  parents are invited to open school week. This year we have specifically planned a series of 6 "Family Fridays" where  parents will be invited in to classrooms during instructional periods, not just to observe but to participate.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 26Q041   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   486   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     After reviewing year-end data from Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Project running record assessments, it was  determined that overall 75% of our students ended the year at a level 3 or 4, which would be on or above grade level.  This is an increase of 4% from the year before. With that said, it also means that we still have 25% of students that  ended the year approaching grade level or below grade level. We seek to increase the number of students performing  on or above grade level. A concern remains within our Special Education and English Language Learner populations. In  our ENL population 38% ended the year at a level 3 or 4, which was a very significant increase from the year before of  only 14%. There is similar data for our students with disabilities. 30% of these students finished the year on or above  grade level. That is not to say that these populations didn’t show growth. We see evidence of consistent movement  forward, however, it is still possible to stay at a level 1 or 2 even with moving up reading levels. Many of our ENL  students are just learning English or are still mastering the language so we want to acknowledge all of their positive  growth, while still seeking our ultimate goal to get more students reading on grade level. *Benchmark running records  will be given as soon as school begins in September and will give us a clear picture of our starting point for the year.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?     We believe that at P.S. 41 we have done an excellent job working with children in regards to strong character, anti- bullying and anti-discrimination. Every year, children across all grades attend an anti-bullying workshop that is hosted  by our PTA. This workshop is then followed up in the classrooms as teachers help to in still anti-bullying principles and  to teach an understanding of the role of bystanders. Strong character and an anti-bullying culture are also evident. As  with our goal last year, we know that there is always room for improvement and we are constantly seeking ways to do  so. We seek to increase the ways in which we are encouraging positive behaviors, conflict resolution skills and positive  choices for children, specifically around Respect for All and the Dignity for all Students Act. This year we will continue  using the Sanford Harmony Program and increase social-emotional learning opportunities for students. This choice is  supported by specific Learning environment Survey Data:       1.  How many adults at this school teach students how to advocate for themselves? 69% of teachers strongly   agree, 17% agree.   2.  How many adults at this school recognize disruptive behavior as social-emotional learning opportunities? 57%   of teachers strongly agree, 17% agree, 17% don’t know.   3.  How many adults at this school teach students the skills they need to regulate their behavior (i.e. by focusing   their attention, controlling emotions, or managing their thinking, behavior and feelings?) 57% of teachers  strongly agree, 33% agree.   4.  How many adults at this school have access to school based supports to assist in behavioral/emotional   escalations? 77% of teachers strongly agree, 20% agree.   Sanford Harmony is a Social Emotional program with the aim of improving peer relationships by teaching students  meaningful ways to interact with each other and express themselves appropriately. It includes fun and engaging  materials including grade specific lessons on topics such as communication, empathy and diversity, stories, games,  activities and conversation cards. The program will be implemented by the guidance counselor and social worker in  group counseling sessions and social skills groups, as well as through classroom visits and by working with teachers to  introduce specific lessons themselves. In addition to specific lessons with accompanying activities, teachers can  choose particular times of the day to address social skills. For example, students can engage with a peer during snack  time to discuss a particular topic, students can share with their class a special moment they had during the week, or  students can participate in show and tell type activities. Students will foster new relationships by learning to practice  teamwork, appreciate diversity, improve listening skills, express ideas, understand others' perspectives, develop  empathy and problem solve.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   During the past school year, 100% of teachers engaged in professional collaborative inquiry work. Much of this work  was specifically focused on the introduction of the Teacher's College Reading and Writing curriculum to our school.  We also employed two different staff developers, one who worked directly with teachers in grades 3-5 and one who  worked with teachers in grades K-2. Staff developers provided on-the-spot feedback and professional learning in small  grade-specific groups. With that said, data from our most recent Learning Environment Survey indicates that there is  specific room for growth in terms of building out opportunities for collaboration. Data also indicates that there are  things we are doing very well, so we seek to sustain that by continuing with what we know to be successful for our  team at this time.    97% of teachers say that their professional development experiences this year have been sustained and coherent.  (Q10a)   97% of teachers say that their professional development experiences this year have included enough time to think  carefully about, try, and evaluate new ideas. (Q10b)   97% of teachers say that they had opportunities to work productively with colleagues at their school on professional  development. (Q10c)   86% of teachers say that they had opportunities to work productively with teachers from other schools on  professional development. (Q10d)   This year we will continue our work with teacher teams and staff developers, including a new upper grade staff  developer. We will also continue to build out opportunities for inter class and inter school collaboration.    Additionally, in line with school wide initiatives, we will offer cycles of learning around Therapeutic Crisis Intervention  (TCIS) for crisis de-escalation, RULER Framework and collaborative teacher teams.

Teacher’s at this school utilize the Danielson Framework as a tool to help guide thinking around best practices. This is  the same tool that administrators use to formally evaluate teacher practice during observations. Our thinking around  4E on the Danielson rubric (Growing and Developing Professionally) has grown. 4E speaks to the continued growth  and development of teachers in order to remain current and stay informed. The teacher actively engages with  colleagues and supervisors in professional conversation about practice. The teacher participates actively in assisting  other educators and looks for ways to contribute to the profession. 100% of our teachers were rated effective or  highly effective with this regard. It is when we look at the further breakdown that we see possibility for positive  change.    According to end-of-year data from our Advance observation system, 34 % of teachers were rated “effective” in 4E  and 66 % were rated “highly effective.” We do not want to portray in any way that an effective rating is not good –  effective is excellent. Teachers work very hard to be effective and effective teachers impact significant positive growth  in children. Our teachers are highly professional and are constantly seeking to improve their practice. Our focus this  year is for teachers to seek new opportunities for professional development beyond what they may be assigned.   With that said, the language of highly effective is slightly different and that is where we see room for some growth.  The primary difference between effective and highly effective is this – for highly, teacher initiates important activities  and takes an active leadership role in professional organizations in order to contribute to the profession.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

At P.S. 41 we believe that we have done an excellent job creating opportunities for families to be in the school for any  number of community events. This is reflected in informal feedback from families, community members and students  as well as in Principal Performance Observations and documents such as the School Quality Snapshot where parents  indicate 96% trust with the school which is far higher than the city average. Some of our family and community  engagement events include: Family Friday, Science Fair, Curriculum Nights, Speech and Language Nights, IEP Nights,  ELL Parent Workshops, Night of Giving (Children create stuffed bears and donate them to a local children’s hospital),  Halloween Party, Hollyrock Game Show Night, Student Led Conferences, ASD Family Workshops, Parent and Child Art  Workshops, APEC visits and trips, School Garden, Blood Drive. Teacher Appreciation Luncheon by parents, Parent  Appreciation Night by teachers, Theater Arts performances and International Night.   With that said, we know that parents play a critical role in the success of their child's education. Through  communication with teachers, administration, SLT meetings, and during our Principal Performance Observation  interviews, parents have expressed an interest in learning new ways to help their children at home. To this end, last  year we offered many different opportunities during Tuesday parent engagement time.   Our most recent Learning Environment Survey indicated the following:    96% of families say that school staff regularly communicate with them about how families can help their child learn.  (Q1a)   99% of families say that they get opportunities to visit their child's classroom, such as observing instruction or  participating in an activity with their child. (Q1b)   99% of families say that they are greeted warmly when they call or visit their school. (Q1c)   98% of families say that they feel well-informed by the communications they receive from their school. (Q1e)   97% of families say that their school communicates with them in a language and in a way that they can understand.  (Q1h)   100% of teachers say that families are offered opportunities to visit their child's classroom, such as observing  instruction or participating in an activity with their child. (Q9a)   This year we seek to continue our growth, building new ways for parents to engage more around the key priorities of  the school as they relate to social emotional learning and academics.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40     State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy      Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?    At P.S. 41Q, our school uses TCRWP to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs. TCRWP is a Common Core-aligned reading  program that supports students' acquisition of reading and vocabulary skills. This data provides insights into the literacy levels  of our ELLs regarding knowledge of concepts of print, identification of individual letters and sounds, sight words and reading  strategies that they use. Literal and inferential comprehension skills are assessed through this tool. Insight is also gained  into ELLs' speaking skills as they retell stories they have read. Furthermore, the ENL program has noted that students gain the  ability to decode through our Fundations program.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The TCWRP assessment correlates to the Fountas and Pinnell system for leveled books and helps teachers match ELLs with  books that they can read independently. This helps ELLs to builds schema, fluency, and build new vocabulary. TCRWP helps to  build comprehension skills and to strengthen vocabulary foundation. It is our hope that the Building Academic Program will  also promote vocabulary growth for our ELLs. On demand writing tasks are analyzed and used to help drive instruction.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   We evaluate the success of our ELLs by analyzing the results of the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, Spanish LAB, ELA, Math, Science,  MOSL, and NYS assessments. TCRWP Assessment Pro, Envisions, Teacher's College Reading and Writing Performance Based  Assessment and Unit Tests, as well as ongoing classroom assessments and the results of the ELL Periodic Assessments. The  success of our ENL program is determined by the outcome of these assessments and the results of the NYSESLAT exam.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once summative data has been gathered, English Language Learners are put into differentiated groups to meet the individual  needs of each student. ENL scaffolding techniques are employed to make content and language instruction comprehensible.  The use of modeling, brain storming, graphic organizers, story mapping, and realia are some of the supportive techniques  used. Cooperative learning and jigsawing are group strategies that facilitate understanding of complex concepts. Ongoing  assessments- formal (tests) and informal (observations) are continuously used to assess progress and realign goals for our  ELLs. Our bilingual staff members encourage and support our entering and emerging ELLs. Within the classroom, flexible  grouping and collaborative discussions support our ELLs oral language development. Materials used with our ELLs promote  rigorous instruction and give ELLs access to concepts being taught. Cultural differences and learning styles are factored into  our planning of instruction. ENL teachers met continuously with classroom teachers to ensure that individual goals are being  met. English Language Learners are given additional support when necessary in all content areas through the use of Great  Leaps, Fundations, and RTI program. Our Title III after school ENL program further supports the needs of our ELLs.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   ELL students are periodically assessed to ensure that their instructional programs are promoting growth and success. During  monthly school meetings, the Pupil Personnel Team speaks about the progress and needs of both special education and ELL  students. If progress is not seen, the team works collaboratively to alter the instructional program, so that the students may  gain more from it, and as a result, show more growth. The team also periodically evaluates 2016-2017 CEP 51 instructional  programs to see that they properly fit the needs of our ELL students, our ELL program and our state standards. In order to  reduce the rate of referrals, a system has been implemented that allows the school staff to properly screen students before an  official referral is made. Participants in this process include administration, the classroom teacher, our school psychologist, and  our ENL teacher. In addition to these methods, our school as a whole works diligently to provide numerous educational  opportunities for our linguistically and culturally diverse populations. As part of HLIS administration and initial interview, the  ENL Teacher inquires as to what the child has learned in his/her own country in Math, Science, Social Studies, and uses that  information to help drive instruction and to take into account the child's educational history and cultural background. The  school also uses data to drive instruction. NYSESLAT results are provided to all teachers with ELLs in order to help assist them  in their planning and to better help them to differentiate their instruction. In terms of planning for new language instruction,  the ENL teachers use the latest NYSESLAT Targets of Measurement in all four modalities.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Outcome assessments data that is used to evaluate and inform our ELL program are as follows:The  NYSITELL looks at the  results for our incoming kindergarten's Speaking and Listening. This gives us insight into what skills they have acquired to date.  This data informs our instruction. All newcomers are tested with the NYSITELL in grades 1-5. This helps us determine  their abilities in Speaking, Listening, Reading, and Writing. We use flexible grouping and targeted instruction, which  addresses the needs and strengths of our ELLs. The NYSESLAT is used to determine the growth our ELLs have made throughout  the school year. The results in each modality is used to inform instruction for the following year. The MOSL is used across all   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         grades, K-5 and gives us insight into our ELLs strengths and needs in written expression. The ELA, Math, and Science state  exams are used to determine how ELLs are performing in regard to grade level NYS standards.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Structures are in place to disseminate the findings to classroom teachers and all service providers. At the beginning of the  school year, the ENL team provides a Professional Development to the entire staff. At this time, teachers are given the  NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, and MOSL results, as well as reviewing the results of all state exams for their ELLs. These results highlight  the strengths and weaknesses of our ELLs. We have meetings on common preps to ensure that our ELLs needs are being  addressed.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   In the Freestanding, ENL program students are grouped heterogeneously in age appropriate classes by grade. When  needed, students are placed in groups with two contiguous grades, as per CR Part 154.2.  ENL instruction is provided  during the school day. Our ENL teachers provide a Freestanding ENL Program. Mrs. Yeres holds certifications in both  TESOL, as well as common branch. Ms. D'Amelio services the integrated ENL push-in model. Within this program, all  students receive a specified amount of standalone ENL and integrated ENL. In the standalone program, instruction to  develop English language skills is the focus. High interest, non fiction units of study are used to develop vocabulary  and schema.  A focus on inferential skills, locating text evidence and group sharing has proven effective in moving our  ELLs in all four modalities- reading, writing, listening, and speaking. In the integrated instruction, the focus is to build  English language skills through content area instruction. ENL teachers work in collaboration with the general  education classroom teachers, and occurs in various classrooms. All students are taught in English. Small groups are  taken within the classroom to support comprehension, encourage classroom participation, and successfully complete  class work. One on one scaffolding is provided for our ELLs when needed. Points of entry are found for all ELLs and  confidence is built. High expectations and rigorous instruction are key in both our standalone and integrated ENL  programs. The majority of our ELLs have successfully moved through the our program within two years and have  proven to achieve the high standards set for all students.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     The students are grouped by grade heterogeneously for targeted areas of instruction. They participate in small group  task orientated activities that guide the production of academic language in Math, Science, and Social Studies.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      There is no Dual Language program at P.S. 41Q at this time      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   All our ELLs  are serviced according to the New York State mandates. Entering students receive a total of 360 minutes weekly (  four periods of Stand-Alone and four periods of Integrated instruction). Emerging students receive 360 minutes of instruction  weekly (two periods of Stand-Alone, four periods of Integrated, and two Flexible periods. Transitioning ELLs receive 180  minutes of instruction weekly (two periods of Integrated and two Flexible periods). Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes of  instruction weekly (four Integrated ELA periods or Content Area periods). Commanding students receive 90 minutes of ENL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      integrated instruction for two years from the date they achieve Commanding status on the NYSESLAT. This include two periods  of ELA or Content Area instruction. Our ENL strategies are infused into content instruction. ENL methodology and instructional  strategies are used to provide academic subject instruction to ELLs in achieving the state designated level of English Proficiency  for the grade. Our expectations for our ELLs are to meet and exceed State and City standards     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   The ENL program is taught in English. In Freestanding ENL, our lessons are designed to meet the standards with varying entry  points based on students' needs. Ongoing assessment strategies are used to determine progress. Content area instruction is  supported by instructional materials, which are aligned to Common Core State Standards. Content area materials are made  comprehensible by activating prior knowledge, differentiating content, through the use of Thinking Maps and graphic  organizers. Vocabulary enrichment is a focus . We use visuals to build upon prior knowledge. Native language support,  cooperative learning groups, and glossaries help make content comprehensible for ELLs. Thematic units are used within the  content area to build schema and strengthen their speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills. We used the National  Geographic non- fiction leveled books. The ENL team modifies grade level content area texts to  content area to give ELLs  experience with reading with grade level content area texts. We also use Mondo’s, Let’s Talk About It uses charts with colorful  pictures to help students learn how to interpret the ideas of others as they read text. Students then begin to join in with the  shared reading and begin to self-correct to maintain accurate meaningful comprehension. Readers Theater is used for all levels  and age groups. It enhances vocabulary and develops fluency and expression by practicing text at an appropriate reading level.  Our new Common Core Learning Standards Literacy Program called Teacher's College Reading and Writing for grades K-5  exposes students to complex texts with close reads and strong academic vocabulary. StoryWorks by Scholastic offers complex  texts to develop language arts and comprehension skills through the use of nonfiction and fiction texts, plays, and poetry.  Additionally, we offer several web –based opportunities that address individual needs.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   ELL students are given the NYS Math and Science assessment in their native language. Teachers of ELLs and former ELLs give  math assessments in the student's' native language, when materials are available. For example, the math program at PS 41  provides additional support in Spanish. When exams are not available in their native language, we provide translators. The  Spanish LAB is administered in Spanish. Books are available in students' native languages (primarily in Chinese and in Spanish  as these two languages are most of our ELL population) and writing samples in their native language are periodically assessed.  Newcomers are encouraged to write in their native language and the ENL teacher finds an in-house interpreter to translate it.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. We do not have any SIFE students enrolled in our school at this time. However, if we ever do receive SIFE students, we will  provide differentiated instruction, supplementing grade-level books with lower-level books and supporting the classroom  teacher with ENL strategies. b. Newcomers to the school are put into the appropriate level according to the NYSITELL results.  They are helped to assimilate to our English program through the use of picture cards, picture dictionaries along with CD’s and  corresponding workbooks, chants, books on tape, basic phonics (regardless of the grade), and TPR (Total Physical Response)  techniques. c. Specialized instructional programs are designed to meet the individual needs of students who will receive ELL  service for 4-6 years. Classroom curricula are modified in a smaller ENL classroom setting in order to reach our ELL students  more efficiently. We are currently using Teacher's College scaffolding strategies and vocabulary routines to enhance the  learning and understanding of vocabulary in complex. Our ENL teacher uses many visual models and strategies in order to  bridge connections between English and the students native language and to elicit a deeper understanding of the curriculum.  Summer school support is offered as well. d. We do not have any long-term ELL's at the present time. Nevertheless, in the case  that we do have long-term ELLs, we are prepared to support them through a variety of ENL strategies, differentiated   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      instruction, supplementing grade level books with simplified alternative texts, and writing support using graphic organizers. e.  The present and former ELL students receive the appropriate test accommodations on all formal state tests, as well as,  informal classroom tests. Former ELL students receive this accommodation for two years. The students are tested in a separate  location, directions are read three times, and they receive time in a half. When the state provides the exam in the student's’  native language, it is given to them. Glossaries are also provided to all ELL students. In addition, we provide students with RTI  and literacy and/or math if necessary.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    Our school has twelve ELL-SWD students. All twelve of these students are placed in an ICT class. This program uses many  specialized strategies that accelerate English language development. In addition to ELL services, these students participate in  daily speech sessions to address conversational skills and pragmatics. The ICT class provides a highly structured classroom  environment with the support of two teachers at all times. In this class, academic tasks are broken down into their barest  components to be made more accessible for the students. All students are provided access to the academic content using  scaffolding strategies, differentiation, accommodations and tailored learning strategies that fit their individual needs as set  forth by the Individualized Education Plans (IEP).      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The needs of Special Education ELL children are met according to their IEPs. Our ELLs are placed in ICT classes or General  Education classes with mandated SETTS services. The students spend the entire school day following the General Educaton  curriculum alongside non-disabled peers. Based on the recommended programs and services in their IEPs, students may also  receive Occupational Therapy, Speech and Language, Physical Therapy, and School Guidance Counselors. RTI instruction is  offered to ELL-SWDs. These services are offered in ELA and Math during the school day, as well as after school. At this time,  our ENL teacher and SETTS teacher are piloting a co-teaching model with a third grade math group to provide ENL and special  education strategies simultaneously. The group consists of ELL-SWDs, as well as non-disabled ELL students.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention for ELLs consists of receiving additional help in the form of RTI instruction, both during the day, and in  the after school programs in Math and Reading. During this time, they are working with teachers using the Envisions Math  Program, Teacher's College Reading and Writing Program, as well as working on tasks to improve their writing skills. Specific  ENL strategies are employed to ensure maximum growth throughout all content areas. Some examples include, incorporation  of content area vocabulary from classroom (ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies) lessons in ENL work periods, ENL teachers  provide classroom teachers with picture cards to accompany read alouds, and to support complex math concepts. ENL  teachers train and empower classroom teachers to simplify language and questioning when addressing ENL students.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      On-going programs that have been implemented for the school year are Isabel Beck's Elements of Reading for Vocabulary  grades K-5, Dramatic Arts Program for Young Audiences, American Ballroom Theater for grade 5,  International Night, Science  Fair, Band and Chorus, Basketball team grades 4 and 5, and CIA (Crocheron Interest Academy). Another focus for our ELLs, as  well as, the whole school is the DOE Literacy and Math Tasks. In literacy, our students are expected to respond to  informational texts. In Math, our students are expected to create viable arguments for solutions in math problems.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We will discontinue Longman's Spin, as the ENL teacher feels it has become outdated. ReadyGen was discontinued and  replaced by Teacher's College Reading.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      All ELLs  have equal access to our enrichment clusters, which is an hour weekly program that offers all students an opportunity  to engage in interest group for enrichment. These groups include activities, such as dancing and choreography, cartography  (map making), Rainbow Looming, cartooning, an environmental club, a digital photography club, a spontaneous painting class,  a build a bear workshop,Origami, an exercise club, a cooking club, collaging, drawing and sketching, and Spanish language  clubs. All ELLs participate in our Arts Programs, such as Ballroom Dancing, Dramatic Arts Program, Band Chorus. All ELL  students may participate in our Sports Program, such as Basketball Team. All ELLs participate on all school trips and our PTA  International Night, where they are encouraged to celebrate their culture through foods, music, clothing, and dance. They are  also eligible for student of the month.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials used to support ELLs include Curriculum Associates for Primary Grades, which is a series of books with  rhyme and repetition that includes things to talk about and things to do. We also use, Celebration Press, Words Their Way,  Mondo and Great Leaps, which helps children practice weekly words, as well as decoding with daily activities. It also  encourages students to practice their speaking skills. In grades K-1, the Fundations phonics program is used to build a  foundation for reading and writing and is supported with multi-modality activities. Saddleback Educational Publishers Basic  English Grammar, provides basic instruction in the eight parts of speech as well as the standard patterns of English sentences.  In addition to these programs, we use the books and materials previously mentioned in part 3, Programming and Scheduling  Information. Our ELLs are also supported with the use of computers, books on CD’s, iPads, and interactive Smartboards.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?    ELLs are partnered with a child in the classroom who speaks their language whenever possible. Our paraprofessionals in the  school are bilingual and speak all of the predominant languages that our ELLs speak - Chinese, Spanish, Korean and Urdu. They  are readily available to assist our ELLs with academic and social issues that present themselves. Native language support is also  delivered in our ENL program model by encouraging students to express themselves through writing in their native language,  sharing books and CDs in their native language and incorporating diversity and celebrating all cultures. In addition all  classroom libraries have leveled books which are matched to each individual’s independent reading level. Assessments are  ongoing to further review and determine if the ELLs are reaching their goals and making improvement.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.     Our school supports ELLs ages and grade levels with required services by placing them in groups that are chronologically  appropriate in order to align their ENL program with the standards and curricula for their grade. In addition, the resources  used by the ENL teacher are leveled by grade and used where appropriate to the student's current academic level.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Upon registration, newly enrolled ELLs and their families are given a tour of the school by the Parent coordinator, Mary Bow.  At that time they meet the ENL teacher and learn about the school, support services, staff and programs offered. Translators  are on hand to assist in this process. A Kindergarten Orientation is held for newly enrolled students to introduce the parents to  the teachers and explain the partnership that we share in their child’s education. At that time parents are given specific  information about what they can do to help ensure their child’s success.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?              Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  P.S. 41 offers ongoing, in-depth professional development to ensure the strong classroom instruction that fosters academic  success. Professional Development opportunities are offered for teachers of ENL. Whenever applicable, ENL Teachers turn-key  the information to staff members during weekly faculty and/or grade meetings/conferences. These sessions support both  teachers and paras by providing them with ENL strategies to better assist their ELLs. Members of our entire staff participate in  meetings regarding ELLs and engage through ongoing professional development and discussions during meetings, planning  days, professional development days, and turn-key of information that ENL Teachers have acquired through attending  workshops and conferences outside of the school. Current techniques and strategies are presented to keep us on the cutting  edge of ENL instructional methodology. During our Professional Development sessions, teachers are involved in reviewing  student work, modifying and adjusting curriculum objectives and learning how to modify instructional practices that address  the needs and build on the strengths of the individual learners in their classes, with a focus on ELLs. The minimum 7.5 hours of  ENL training for all staff is achieved through the aforementioned Professional Development sessions. The entire staff receives  training in ENL strategies and methodologies in the classroom, BICS/CALP and the stages of language development, as well as  NYSESLAT data analysis and ELL related tests scores. An emphasis has been placed on differentiation of instruction, engaging  students with one another around rigorous academic content and developing language and literacy through the content areas.  The Danielson rubrics and DOK levels are the focus to promote complex thinking skills for all students. A particular focus this  year is on deepening the staff's understanding of the content and cognitive demands of the CCLS and the math and ELA  performance tasks students are required to take. An emphasis is placed on further understanding the principles set forth in the  Universal Design for Learning and how to apply them to customize instructional plans to meet the range of learners in our  schools, including the ELL students. Collaborative inquiry will take place on the execution of the CCSS literature and math tasks  and the Universal Design for Learning   A key component of helping our ELLs succeed is the ongoing process of professional development. This year we expect  multiple opportunities to provide various professional development. The ENL Teachers will help meet the need of the staff by  offering the mandated 7.5 hours of ELL training. The best ways for or entire staff to be knowledgeable is through professional  development, turn-keying information during faculty meetings/conferences, and workshops/seminars attended outside of the  school. Members of our entire staff participate in discussing grade level planning, reviewing best teaching methodologies and  differentiated learning. Also, Planning units and lessons that align the common core standards. Often times, we review  students work and plan accordingly to meet the needs of all our students, including ELLs.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2. Teachers receive 15% of their total hours  in ENL specific professional development. This training encompasses well above the 7.5 hours of ENL training. The entire staff  receives training in ENL strategies and methodologies during the professional development Mondays. At this time, the ENL  teacher reviews ENL strategies and methodologies. A data analysis of the NYSESLAT is done, as well as, strategies and  approaches to use with Entering and Emerging ELLs. Agendas and attendance will be maintained by the ENL teachers to record   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         hours. Teachers attend Teacher's College Workshops to learn additional ENL strategies to support their ELLs within the  classroom. Teachers also attend Borough Field Support Center Workshops.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents of ELLs are notified through the use of interpreters and letters sent home, that an individual meeting to discuss goals,  progress, and language proficiency assessments results will be held. During this meeting, the ENL teacher will share the  assessments of the student's work (writing samples, TC assessments). A discussion of the student's progress in the areas of  reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills will be the focus. An assessment of the student's needs in all content areas will  be shared with the parent at this time. The goals of the ENL Program are discussed with the parent/guardian at this time. All  documentation will be compiled in a binder for each individual child.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   At P.S. 41 parent involvement is encouraged throughout the school year. Our Parent Coordinator offers tours to incoming  families. She also offers to introduce new non-English speaking parents to bilingual parents in our community. This often  occurs during PTA meetings as well. Parents are encouraged to come to our PTA meetings via Student of the Month  certificates. We provide written translations for our non- English speaking parents with information regarding special events in  the school and school community. Oral translations are provided as well. During parent teacher conferences, interpreters are  offered to all non- English speaking parents. P.S. 41 PTA manages a website which contains pertinent information for all  parents. PTA newsletter is distributed 4-5 times per year to families to inform them of the various activities that take place at  our school. Parents are welcomed to visit their child's class during the Writing Celebration, which concludes the end of the  unit. In Kindergarten, parents are encouraged to volunteer as the class surprise reader on a weekly basis. During our  International Festival our ELL parents are involved with cooking foods from their native countries, wearing their native  costumes, and choreographing songs and dances from their culture. P.S. 41 encourages ELL parents to participate in  Community Based Organizations workshops. All notifications of workshops are distributed in parents native languages.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, JOSEPH FERRARA, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 41Q/Crocheron School                                                                              School DBN: 26Q041  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Using the data recorded in ATS and based on the HLIS (Home Language Identification Survey), annual school  reports, blue emergency card indicators, discussions at school leadership meetings and PTA meetings, teacher  workshops and daily parent teacher contact, we assess the school’s need for written translation and oral  interpretation. During the school day, we have staff members to translate. At times, when we find the need for a  translator, we contract outside agencies to work with us. During our school review, parents and teachers indicate  a need to translate all letters. Interpreters as well as school personnel who are able to translate and interpret are  made available during individual parent-teacher conferences to ensure progress in instruction, as well as,  addressing all the parents/guardians questions or concerns.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65     2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    Based on our school data  and school-wide  language needs,  gathered from school  leadership and PTA  meetings, our greatest  need is English, Chinese  and Spanish Translation  for both written and oral  communication.  However, we also have  parents who speak  Korean, Urdu, and  Tagalog. Translation is  provided when needed.  Our parent coordinator in  conjunction with  teachers and other staff  members who are able to  communicate in either of  those two languages  provide parents with  needed translation. We  also provide written  translations on all  documents as provided  by the DOE website to  those parents in need.  Translated letters are  sent home informing  parents of available  translation services.  Parental notices are sent  in English and other  home languages  informing parents of the  availability of translation  and interpretation  services at the school  level. In addition, copies  of such notices are  posted in a prominent  location near the main  office of the school.  Letters are sent home to  parents in the home  language whenever   According to school data  gathered from the School  Leadership Team and PTA  meetings, there is an  equal preference for  written and oral  translations with Spanish  and Chinese being in  greatest demand.       .   A small percentage of  Koren, Urdu and Tagalog  translations are required.  The preference is  primarily oral and most  easily accessible due to  staff members being  readily able and available  to provide  communications in native  languages. Written  communications are also  provided, as needed.
