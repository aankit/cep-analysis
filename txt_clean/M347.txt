This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      The mission of PS 347 is to provide a joyful learning environment that celebrates the education, growth and  difference of each and every student.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8      An engaging and rigorous curriculum is offered in American Sign Language and Standard English, and supported in  small classes that provide children the opportunity to achieve their personal best.   Our staff is committed to inspiring and encouraging curiosity, empathy, and social awareness by developing higher- level thinking skills and exploring real world issues that extend into the community.   By fostering a partnership with families, we can support individual student goals to enable each child to become an  independent and responsible life-long learner, preparing for success in the journey to higher education.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   The “47” - American Sign Language & English Lower School is a Pre-K through 8th school with 202 students. We are a  very unique school in that the majority of our students are either Deaf, hard-of-hearing, or hearing children of Deaf  parents. Their home language is American Sign Language and English is their second language.   An engaging and rigorous standards-based curriculum is offered in American Sign Language (ASL) and Standard  English, and supported in small classes that provide children the opportunity to achieve their personal best.    Our staff is committed to inspiring and encouraging curiosity, empathy, and social awareness by developing higher- level thinking skills and exploring real world issues that extend into the community. By fostering a partnership with  families, we support individual student goals to enable each child to become an independent and responsible life-  long learner, and prepare them for success in the journey to higher education.    We have a long-standing role in the Deaf community of New York City and cherish our relationship with the "47"  Alumni Association and other organizations that do outreach to the Deaf community, such as New Victory Theatre,  Children's Museum of the Arts, and New York Foundling Hospital.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We have a small population of 20-25 Deaf and hard-of-hearing students. Because of the unique nature of our  population, we believe students learn best when they are: 1) In classrooms that are an equitable place for learning; 2)  given multiple opportunities to engage in sophisticated discussion; and 3) taught by highly-qualified teachers who  hold high expectations for every child and the belief that all students will achieve college and career readiness.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   PROGRESS MADE OVER THE LAST YEAR:      Preliminary school survey results from parents, students and teachers have shown an improvement in five out of  six areas (Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment, Effective School Leadership, Strong Family and Community  Ties, and Trust. We made the most gains in the area of Strong Family-Community Ties.      State Math and ELA scores have yet to be released at the time of this writing; however, in 2017, PS 347 was one of  the top ten most improved schools in the city in ELA due to 41% of our students receiving a level 3 or 4 in ELA. (an  increase of 10 percent from the year before.)    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9         Teachers in grades K through 8 received intensive professional development in the area of Math in the 2017-18  school year. Number Talks were implemented three times a week, as well as a weekly "5-P" lesson. Teachers also  received support in understanding Engage NY, our Math curriculum. Finally, teachers in grades K-3 were introduced  to, and trained, in how to administer the E-CAM (Early Childhood Assessment in Math) and created centers to  support student understanding.       KEY AREAS OF FOCUS:   Our CEP goals address our key areas of focus; they were chosen based on multiple sources of data: the Quality  Review, the Principal’s Performance Reviews, the annual School Survey, the draft Framework for Great Schools  Report and student performance data. The entire faculty and the School Leadership Team also had the opportunity  to weigh in.      We will build upon our ongoing work in literacy to ensure that all students achieve grade-level benchmarks.   Teachers will continue to work with Teachers College Reading and Writing Project to deepen their  understanding of each students' needs based on formative assessments and how to support each student  so they can reach grade-level expectations.      We will continue to build upon the work begun in Math during the 2017-18 school year and continue to   deepen our understanding of the standards, the curriculum (Engage NY) and various assessments, to ensure  that all students achieve grade-level benchmarks.     We will strengthen the home-school connection by improving our outreach to families and creating more   opportunities to be involved in various aspects of our school.     We will build staff capacity to handle challenging behaviors in a way that supports students' social-        emotional growth.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 02M347   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   197   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Multiple sources of data (the 2016-17 Quality Review, the 2017-18 Principal Performance Observation, and the 2017- 18 school survey) all point to “Supportive Environment” as one of our strongest areas.      The 2016-17 Quality Review states, “School leadership provides training and consistently communicates high  expectations to all staff via professional development and weekly newsletters. Teacher teams and staff establish a  culture for learning that consistently communicates high expectations via rubrics, grade level progressions and goal  setting.”       The Principal's Performance Review states, "As we walked through the school today, we observed students and adults  treat each other respectfully and student voice was celebrated. Your approach to culture building and social- emotional support results in a safe environment and inclusive culture that is conducive to student and adult learning."      The Annual School Survey (2017) reports that 100% of students say their teachers respect their culture or background,  and 100% report that teachers present positive images of people from a variety of races, ethnicities, cultures and  backgrounds.       An area of need, according to the 2017 Annual School Survey, is to support teachers with how to incorporate  students' cultural and linguistic backgrounds in their practice. 43% of teachers reported they received support in this  area; 53% disagreed.       Our goal for Supportive Environment will address this area of need.       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   According to the 2016-17 School Quality Guide, this was the area of greatest growth. Staff and parents responded  positively to questions about the school leadership. However, questions revolving around teacher influence in shared  decision making (i.e. hiring new professional personnel, planning how discretionary school funds should be used,  selecting instructional materials used in classrooms, developing instructional materials and setting standards for  student behavior) reflected a 47% favorable response (an increase of 9% from the year before, and 18% from 2 years  ago.)   Teachers have also reported to school leaders that they want an increased voice in decisions that affect them and the  school. Therefore, our goal for “Effective School Leadership” pertains to elevating the level of shared decision-making  between school leaders and teachers.       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June of 2018, we will receive a rating of “Good” or “Excellent” on the School Quality Guide in the area of Effective  School Leadership.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

School leaders also send job postings to  colleges with Deaf Education programs; i.e. Teachers College, Hunter College, Rochester Institute of Technology and  Gallaudet University.    Candidates come for an initial interview, and are then asked for up to two rounds of demonstration lessons, if  possible.   Retention and Support: Our professional development is structured to support individual teachers, as well as groups  of teachers, on content instruction and best practices in pedagogy; whole school professional development is geared  towards school-wide priorities, such as standards alignment, ICT models, social-emotional learning, team-building,  etc. The PD committee, consisting of teachers, are a resource for new teachers who are free to make requests for  particular PDs. New teachers are also provided with a on-site mentor; small group sessions are offered throughout  the year to support teachers new to the profession.   Assignments: Teachers complete a preference sheet at the end of each school year, followed by a meeting with the  principal to determine the best placement for each individual - one that showcases his or her strengths as well as  improving academic outcomes for all students.           2b.

K-8 teachers indicated they were  satisfied with, and wished to continue with, Teachers College Reading and Writing Project. Similarly, teachers also  expressed a desire to continue using Engage NY for Math.   Teachers meet using protocols to review student assessments, student work and teachers' conference notes to target  gaps and design modified small-group work and assessments. Exemplars for grade-level work is used to create and/or  understand common rubrics and to align the work vertically from K-8. Teachers College staff developer and  Generation Ready consultant will support this work.    School Administrators review NY State ELA and Math state exams with teachers to help staff understand the  expectations of the Common Core.       4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34     used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The 47 American Sign Language & English Lower School, in compliance with  the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and  implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving  them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to  actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained  volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The American Sign Language and English Lower School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;  ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and  decision making in support of the education of their children;  ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;  ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;  ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:  ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the  school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies  as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical  support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;   ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of  the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming  and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for  parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support  services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality  Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;  ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents  of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be  involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other  applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);  ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the  Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37         ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;  ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;  ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;  ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;  ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;  ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;  ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about  school activities and student progress;  ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

As per  our 20`18 NYSESLAT analysis, our  ELLs are the following proficiency level: Expanding (11),  Transitioning (8), Entering (7) and Emerging (4).  Upon examination of our NYSESLAT and ELA data, we observed that K-4 graders need  additional support in development of academic English especially  in the areas of reading and  writing. All language modalities will be addressed, however, our ELLs will receive targeted  instruction in various academic writing genres (journal writing, narrative writing and others) To  help improve these areas and to show gains in NYSESLAT results, all our ELL students in  grades K, 1, 2, 3 and 4  will receive small group supplemental enrichment instruction through  our Before School Literacy Program for ELLs.  The language of instruction will be English with  native language support provided as needed. This program will focus on Literacy and  will be co- taught by a certified ENL teacher and  2 common branch teachers fluent in American Sign  Language. Students will receive 1 hour of supplemental enrichment instruction Monday through  Thursday,  4 days a week from 7:25-8:25. The optimal time for our school for the Title III  program is before school since out students come from all 5 boroughs by bus. Students will be  taught in a small group setting based on their proficiency levels and grade as well as their  specific needs in reading and writing. This program will run from  January 7th to May 31st  for a  total of 17 weeks . The ENL teacher will co-teach with 2 classroom teacher and ensure that  minimum 50% of the direct instruction for each ELL in the program is received from the  certified ENL teacher. The  Before School Literacy Program for ELL will focus on developing  students’ literacy strategies and skills needed when engaging in fiction and non-fiction text while  developing reading and writing skills. A Levelled Literacy Enrichment  resource and  supplemental materials by Fountas and Pinnell will be used. In addition, activities will focus on  helping children express their critical thinking skills in the English language. Observations,  portfolio work, oral and written reports will be used in out Title III program. The materials and  general supplies will help literature come alive for students. Title III reading instruction will  include supplemental materials purchased for exclusive use in the program such as, Red Rocket  Readers and Flying Start Books. Materials will be at no cost to Title III. All Title III funding will  be spent on per session for direct instruction.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Teachers assess ELL's literacy skills using TCRWP running records, and the DRA if further information is needed.  This data is  compared to NYSESLAT and baseline assessment results for students in grades 3-8.  Students tend to be proficient in listening  and speaking and delayed in reading and writing.  The same was seen with the NYS ELA.  Students did well with the multiple  choice but presented with delays in the writing.   Teachers use these results to target instruction; the results tend to be  consistent.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teacher team meetings to collaboratively review results  F-status teachers to assist with the administration of running records and NYSESLAT     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our ESL program by looking at how they perform in their core courses as well as how well they  perform on state and local assessments when we have upper grade ELLs. We use a variety of assessments: TCRWP running  records, Writing Pathways rubrics, conference notes and NYC Performance Tasks.  We look at these data results to determine  if any modifications to the current programs need to be made and to make any necessary changes in instruction and in  professional development.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We have two F-status and one librarian providing LLI (Leveled Literacy Intervention) services to those students in need of  reading intervention.   We also support teachers in planning for small groups and conferences to ensure students receive all the support they can to  achieve grade level mastery.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   During planning meetings or professional development sessions, teachers review data and collaborate with one another to  determine which tier of intervention needs to be implemented for their students.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We use TCRWP running records to monitor student progress throughout the year. State test results for children in grades 3-8  are also reviewed to identify areas for support. We also use exit tickets and unit assessments from Engage NY to monitor  student growth. Students tend to be proficient in listening and speaking and delayed in reading and writing.  The same results  were seen with formal and informal ELA assessments.  Students did well with the multiple choice but their writing skills are  often below grade level.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Teacher team meetings  Instructional Cabinet  Administrative review of data         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   We follow the requirements of CR part 154.2 for integrated and standalone ENL support, based on students  proficiency levels.  The ESL teacher either pushes in or pulls out depending on the mandates for the specific  proficiency level of the student. ESL instruction is delivered through a push-in and pull out model, considering grade  and proficiency level, and based on the guidelines outlined in NYSED CR 154.2 chart for ENL units of study and staffing  requirements. Ms. Pope services the standalone ENL for entering and emerging students. Push in support is scheduled  according to the state mandated number of minutes for each proficiency level.    b.

DL program.  If applicable.      Instruction is delivered via the Integrated Co-teaching model.  One teacher is hearing, the other teacher is a native  ASL speaker.  They work side by side, parallel teaching while delivering instruction in both languages.        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              PS 347 follows state mandates for servicing ELLs with the designated number of minutes for ESL and ELA  instruction.  The certified ESL teacher provides ESL stand alone ENL support for entering and emerging students.  The ESL  certified teacher pushes in to collaborate and co-teach with classes where there are transitioning and expanding  students.  Support is scheduling according to the state mandated number of minutes for each proficiency level.  This year we  have one student, transitioning level.  In addition we are providing the state mandated transitional support for 3 students who  tested out on the NYSELSAT within the past 2 years., through support by the ESL teacher and also for some students by the  math teacher who is dual certified. Beginner and entering students receive 360 ENL minutes, 180 standalone and 180  integated;  Intermediate/emerging receive 360 minutes, 90 minutes standalone and 180 integrated plus flexible 90 minutes  either standalone or integrated; intermediate/transitioning receive 180 minutes, 90 minutes integrated and another 90  minutes either standalone or integrated; advanced/expanding receive 180 integrated.  Proficient/commanding students  receive 90 minutes integrated ENL.  Integrated ENL is in ELA or another content area, support during writing workshop,  reading workshop, science, math or social studeis.  For standalone the ESL teacher coordinates with the mainstream classroom  and specialty subject area teachers to ensure content alignment.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      The ESL teacher collaborates with the classroom and content area teachers about curriculum and student progress.  The ESL  teacher provides support for the academic vocabulary and language structures specific to the content area, and strategies for  the proficiency level/language acquisition stage of the students.  For beginner and newcomers, for example, the ESL teacher  uses extensive visuals, gestures, carefully structured questions, TPR, charts, graphs, chants, and songs. All students participate  in hands on experiences and projects, where oral and written language is used in small group and partner collaborations and  discussions. Methods are drawn from approaches such as QTEL and SIOPP, along with visuals, graphic organizers and  technology.  These approaches emphasize language development across content areas, and support the Common Core  emphasis on reading and writing for information and standards for oral language. Some of the materials we are using include  Benchmark Education's materials for ELLs.  We use selected non-fiction titles in Benchmark's Early English Explorers series for  K-2, and English Explorers for 3-6, and math Explorers .  All of these materials include strong visual support, appropriate  text/picture ratio, and some include audio CDs or talking e-books. We also use monolingual English picture dictionaries,  including picture dictionaries for content areas.  Other materials not designed specifically for ELLs but effective in supporting  ELLs include Triumph Learning Best Practices in Reading which pairs fiction and non fiction reading, Scholastic Magazine's  "Let's Find Out" for lower elementary, Reading A to Z leveled books, and Quick Reads by Pearson for comprehension and  fluency.  For teacher professional material includes "Common Core for the Not-So-Common Learner, English Language Arts  Strategies", and articles about ELLs and reading in the International Reading Assocation's journal.           4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?       All of our ELLs are American born Spanish speakers .  They do not read or write Spanish and are not tested in their first  language. .        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.

The ESL teacher would service the students as per Part CR 154.2.  A SIFE plan combines literacy  development in the students' native language, English language development, and content instruction.  PS 347 currently has  no SIFE students.   Personalized Learning Plans for students would include English and native language diagnostic tests,  academic data analysis, social-emotional learning, short and long term goals, research based instructional strategies and  supports, and school-family connection. Since PS 347 is a choice school and not a neighborhood school, if ELLs new to the U.S.  attended our school, they would be Deaf.  The child's proficiency would be improved in speaking, understanding, reading and  writing in his/her native language by using a translator.  If the child  is oral Deaf, the school would request a bilingual  paraprofessional to help with the student's comprehension of content area curricula.  This student would then receive one to  one or small group instruction to increase English vocabulary as well as American Sign Langauge, which would transfer to  increased comprehension of the CCSS.           b.  Newcomer K students are serviced with a focus on hands on activities based on content instruction.  Emphasis is on oral  language development, with extensive structured opportunities for speaking and listening.  Reading and writing is integrated  as students develop vocabulary and basic language structures.  The ESL teacher articulates with the classroom teachers and  content area teachers of the newcomer students on a regular basis.  Instructional materials are selected that provide extensive  use of visuals and graphic support for text, and with a focus on language development.  Instructional strategies for newcomers  include instruction based on authentic hands on activities, the use of maps, the use of visuals on content area word walls, TPR,  modeling, gestures, frequent checks for listening comprehension through carefully structured questions allowing students to  respond through pointing, one or two words, or responses to either/or questions, sentence frames, and connections to the  student’s background knowledge.  We also can use computer programs that allow students to interact with stories read aloud  on the internet and other computer programs effective for newcomer ELLs such as Starfall, among others.     c.   Developing students focus on increasing comprehension in English as the ESL teacher pushes in to the content area  classroom.  Supports include visual aids, hands on activities, and graphic organizers. Because the ESL teacher pushes in, it  allows for students to increase English proficiency in all four modalities of communication.  ESL teacher maintains  communication with the classroom teachers to discuss data analysis of student assessments.      d.     Plans for long term ELLs focus on new instructional approaches, literacy in English simultaneous with content learning, to  teach language through content.  Strategies include partner work based on a task or interest, think-pair-share, brainstorming,  checking work with a partner, peer editing, modeling, videos, guest speakers, presentations and demonstrations, interest  centers and cooperative learning assignments.       e.     Former ELLs are entitled to two years' transitional support in the classroom, 90 minutes integrated ENL per week.  They  are also entitled to testing accommodations for two years following scoring proficiency on the NYSESLAT.  Testing  accommodations include extended time and separate location.   Former ELLs are closely monitored by ESL certified teachers  providing transitional support and by their classroom teachers.  The ESL teacher provides additional strategies to classroom  teachers to support these students in the areas which have been identified as needing additional language development.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers College Reading & Writing Workshop, Fundations, and Engage NY  are the curricula currently being used for ELA and  Math respectively.  The workshop model consisting of a mini-lesson, try it, and share out is used for instructional delivery.  ELL- SWDs who receive Integrated Co-teaching have the support of two teachers during the school day to modify and break down  instruction.  Related service providers of ELL-SWDs who are not ICT use the push-in model to support these students during  instruction.                 2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL-SWDs who receive Integrated Co-teaching means during the school day, they are with one general teacher education and  one special education teacher.  The students are able to receive modified materials or differentiated instruction during the day  with the support of both teachers.  Students are scheduled according to the level of support required.  It is possible for a  student to have full-time ICT on their IEP or ICT for one or two subjects. The school has intervention teachers who works with  students using Leveled Literacy Intervention.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The Fountas and Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention program is used for students performing below grade level in ELA for  students in grades K-5. Students are pulled in small groups according to their reading levels and instructed by the intervention  teacher.  Students in grades 6-8 use Scholastic's Read 180 as an intervention program.  Students in math are grouped  according to level of ability.  Teachers work with these students in small groups to address areas of need.  The same goes for  science and social studies.  Instructional data analysis from the 2016 NYS ELA and Math tests are reviewed and used to inform  instruction. Data from the fall benchmarks and baseline assessments are also used to inform instruction.             9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      NYS ELA and math test scores have shown only slight improvement over the past three years. Last year the school hired an  intervention teacher who used Leveled Literacy Intervention to work with students according to their F&P levels.  She also  trained two other teachers on how to use LLI, and they are also providing services.     We also are contracting with Teachers College Inclusive Classrooms Project to work with our staff on improving their co- teaching models, understanding each students' learning needs, and improving the use of technology.    To support our Middle School students, we will train all MS teachers how to use Read 180, an intervention reading program for  students below grade level.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   There are no programs/services that will be discontinued.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Being a small school, students have access to al programs.  We do not have after school services.  Supplemental services are  Just Words and Wilson Intensive in which students have access.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  For content area classes, Teachers College Reading and Writing Workshop, Engage NY, Harcourt textbooks for social studies  and science are used.  Every classroom has a library of at least 150 leveled books along with access to computers and  laptops.  Read 180 is an intervention reading program based on the workshop model and allows for small group and whole  group instruction, plus 20 minutes of computer time with an individualized interactive comprehension and fluency practice  daily.  In collaboration with classroom teachers, the ESL teacher has ordered materials for different grade and proficiency  levels from Benchmark Education, specifically designed for ELLs, and instructional materials focused on short passages for  reading comprehension.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In our Dual Language classes, language support is delivered via a side by side collaborative team teaching model.  Students  continue to develop ASL skills while increasing content knowledge in English and ASL.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.     ESL students are serviced by grade and proficiency level.  The ESL teacher maintains regular contact with classroom teachers  to ensure maximum integration of language development within content area curriculum on the grade.  Content material,  including fiction and non-fiction content, is available in a range of levels.  Supplemental materials such as picture dictionaries  are available for a range of ages, including language for daily use, and content picture dictionaries for upper grade students.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    For content area classes, Teachers College Reading and Writing Workshop, Engage NY, Harcourt textbooks for social studies  and science are used.  Every classroom has a library of at least 150 leveled books along with access to computers and  laptops.  Read 180 and Expert 21 are an intervention reading program based on the workshop model and allows for small  group and whole group instruction, plus 20 minutes of computer time with an individualized interactive comprehension and  fluency practice daily.  In collaboration with classroom teachers, the ESL teacher has ordered materials for different grade and  proficiency levels from Benchmark Education, specifically designed for ELLs, and instructional materials focused on short  passages for reading comprehension.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Currently there is no orientation that is offered to newly enrolled ELL students.  When students register or visit the school for  consideration, they are given a tour of the school and programs that are offered.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Students in the 6th and 7th grade will have American Sign Language classes.         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   a.  We use a side-by-side dual language model.  In Class A, self-contained and side-by-side model in Class  B.  In Class A, EPs and ELLs are integrated 100% of the time.  In Class B, ELLs are taught ELA and Math  separately and they are integrated for other subjects.  b.  In class A, the target language (ASL) is used 80% of the time in an ICT setting.  In Class B, the target  language is used 50% of the time.    c.  American Sign Language and English are taught parallel.  Students have access to both languages  during the school day.  d.  Depending on the student's academic level, some students are taught using both language at the  same time.  Some students are taught ELA and math in the child's native language.              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The Professional Development calendar for 2017-18 is still in the progress of being created; this section will be udpated once it  is complete.    The first six weeks of school, all teachers in K-8 will focus on assessment practices, especially in the use of conference notes.  ELL teachers will be included in every monday PD offered to all other teachers.     We also will have staff developers from Teachers College work with teachers in K-8 on literacy and co-teaching; ELL teachers  will participate in these sessions.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  During the Chancellor's professional development in the Spring and when applicable during weekly professional  developments, the topics of professional development will be Process of 2nd Language Acquisition, Vocabulary Strategies and  Development, How Cultural Differences Affect Teaching and Learning, and Techniques for scaffolding ELLs in the Classroom.,  and writing language objectives in lesson plans across content areas.        Teachers are also sent to MFSC (Manhattan Field Service Center) for professional learning opportunities on ELLs. Sign-in sheets  are kept at the MFSC.    Sign-in sheets will be kept in the main office.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In addition to the regularly scheduled parent teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, etc, we will arrange individual  meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss program goals, their child's language development progress,  ESL assessment results  or language development needs.  At PS 347 we have a very small number of ELLs. Also PS 347 is a choice rather than  neighborhood school.  Therefore we coordinate the individual parent meetings to accommodate the parent or guardian's  schedule.   Interpretation is provided by the Office of Interpreting Services for parents who are Deaf, staff members who are  proficient Spanish-speakers translate for parents during meetings, and over the phone translations are provided by the  Translation Unit for speakers of other languages.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   We have an amazing parent coordinator who ensures that parents are apprised of every event that occurs in our  school.  Parents are an integral part of our school and we have a strong PTA.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    After being informed by the Department of Education that native ASL users are considered ELLs, we are currently in the process of  incorporating all of our native American Sign Language users into the ESL program and planning for the services to which they are  entitled. All native ASL users were given the NYSITELL in the Spring of 2017 and we are waiting for the results which we hope to  receive in August. Once these results are released and we receive hard data about the number of students needing ESL services,  this LAP will change.                          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, David Thacker Bowell, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN: 02M347  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      When parents complete the HLIS, it is entered into ATS and noted that documents sent home need to be  translated as well as interpretation services provided for parent-teacher conferences and meetings. When a  parent needs to be called, DOE interpretation services are used if there is not a staff member who speaks that  language. We also refer to the blue emergency contact cards filled out by each family at the time of enrollment.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    0   158   1   0   8   3   1   GREEK   ENGLISH   RUSSIAN   SLOVAK   SPANISH   (AMERICAN) SIGN  LANGUAGE   URDU              0   92.4   0.58   0   4.68   1.75   0.58   2   102   1   1   14   50   1   1.17   59.65   0.58   0.58   8.19   29.24   0.58   3.
