This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   We are committed to achieving academic success for all students, through collaboration, community relationships,  and empowering self-reliant learners.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    At I.S. 254, students enjoy our family-like atmosphere. This creates an environment of trust between teachers,  students and the administration. Teachers are readily accessible to students before, during and after-school. Our  school features a variety of academic and recreational programs, including after-school sports and arts programs.  Parents enjoy having access to teachers, guidance counselors, administrators, and school staff. Parents are invited to  school events to learn about their child's academic, social and emotional progress. Our school conducts special  outreach to parents of students with a variety of learning needs. Beyond the required academic courses, students  participate in a variety of extracurricular classes such as career development, tutoring, arts and sports.   Our Special Initiatives to enhance instruction include:     Writing Across Curriculum     Middle School Quality Initiative       Learning Partners Program  Lincoln Center Teaching Artists   As a result of the implementation of the aforementioned programs, we have seen growth in our English Language Arts  and Math test results. Special education students are also getting the same high-level ELA and mathematics Common  Core curriculum--Expeditionary Learning and Engage NY--with scaffolded instruction and adapted assessments.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   At I.S. 254, we are committed to improving the educational experience for all of our students and pay special  attention to students in special populations.      Our English Language Learner (ELL) population makes up 40% of our overall student population. Within the   ELL subgroup, we have a range of students from newcomer to long term ELL's. The needs of newcomers is to  simultaneously strengthen their skills in their home language while creating the environment to master  academic English language. Long term ELL's need to be pushed to acquire the English Language while taking  away the scaffolds that hold them back.     Our population of Students with Disabilities makes up 30% of our overall student population. The needs range   from students in 12:1:1 settings to SETTS. The students in this subgroup need exposure to rigorous academic  work and opportunities to demonstrate mastery in order to move from most restrictive to least restrictive  environments. The writing of and execution of quality Individual Education Plans (IEPs) is crucial.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The framework of Great Schools elements where our school has made the most progress are:   1.  Rigorous Instruction: Upon reviewing our end of year DRP scores as well as the preliminary cut scores, there   was an decrease in students not meeting grade level standards, particularly in the 7th and 8th grade.    2.  Effective School Leadership: The new administrative team at I.S. 254 was able to deliver and develop high   quality instructional support that drove student achievement. This was evidenced by the gains made by the  various academic departments.   3.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers participated in variety of professional learning opportunities to improve  success in their classrooms and in the school. Additionally, teachers participated in turn-keyed pd done in  house based on the learning from outside PD   In addition to continuing to build on those successes, the school aims to improve in the following areas:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10            1.  Supportive Environment: The school is in need of a comprehensive, coherent and consistent Social Emotional  Learning program to ensure a culture where the students feel safe, supported and challenged by their peers  and their teachers.   2.  Strong Family-Community Ties: The school needs to establish a parent empowerment program to increase   parent voice and participation in the school.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 10X254   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   469   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   All staff members participate in school wide professional development with a focus on the CCLS. ELA & Math teachers  have received Professional Learning on CCLS and the new curriculum EL and CMP3. Professional development is  provided after-school on Monday, during weekly department meetings by lead teachers and our literacy coach and  during push in sessions by instructional coaches and outside consultants.   New teachers are targeted for professional development by meeting with mentors on a weekly basis. Mentors work  with new teachers on reviewing the Danielson Framework and providing feedback based on the Framework, before  and after administrative observations. Mentors also visit other experienced teachers with their mentees and look for  one aspect of instruction that can be incorporated into practice.    High quality professional development is provided by our MSQI coach on an individual and department wide basis.  For example, our coach modeled running records for tiered intervention teachers and is working with teachers to  continue this practice. In addition, he is holding PD for social studies and ELA teachers on reciprocal teaching, to  ensure teachers are taking ownership of their learning.    Assistant principals have attended several professional development sessions as part of our MSQI initiative and have  turn keyed best practices to teachers. For example, one assistant principal has led several PDs on Tiered Intervention  strategies for reading. Our literacy coach has provided professional development for ELL teachers around best  practices in the writing workshop model for ELL students.         Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

Teachers who are part of the MOSL comitte will turnkey professional development regarding the use of  assessment results to improve instruction. In addition outside consultants from District Public will provide PD to  teachers on the use of assessments to improve instruction.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds.

IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy      Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. I.S. 254, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.         Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    I.S. 254 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

After analyzing the results of students on the 2016-2017  NYSESLAT, we  realize our ELL population has significant deficits in reading and writing. The rationale,  therefore, of initiating a supplemental program is to specifically address these deficits.  Our  primary focus is the design of an after-school program with rigorous instruction in verbal  communication, print concepts, phonological awareness, decoding, sight word identification,  fluency and writing fundamentals.    The focus subgroup within our ELL population are the fifty students that have been classified as  Entering due to their performance on the most recent NYSELAT exam.  These students will be  served regardless of grade, hence the composition of the program will include sixth, seventh, and  eighth graders.    The program will be held twice a week, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, for two hours per  day, 2:45-4:45.  The program is scheduled to begin in November and end in April for a total of  64 sessions.  Our intention is to conduct instruction in English, utilizing two currently employed, ESL  certified teachers.  The team will be led by a coordinating  teacher with vast bilingual and ESL  experience.  The coordinating teacher will lead the planning of instruction and monitor student  progress.    The materials we selected and the data we gather will guide our instruction. Strategies we will  use include guided reading, scaffolding, purposeful grouping and total physical response.  The materials include the following three reading programs: Great Leaps, Wilson and Just  Words.  To foster language acquisition and foundational skill building we will use Rosetta Stone  resources.  The Rosetta Stone resources will aid with pronunciation, and decoding.  The program  will also expose students to metacognitive strategies that will increase phonological awareness.

All teachers involved in the delivery of instruction, including the coordinator, will undergo  professional development.    ELL teachers will receive training once a week during team meetings, as well as during a six- week cycle of professional development after school. The topics to be covered are: balanced  literacy and reading strategies, UDL (to ensure consistency with instructional application), and  scaffolding strategies (to address remedial needs, and move beyond basic competency). PD will  begin in September and end at the beginning of June. PD will be provided by lead teacher/Ell  coordinator Kim Brown including support from our Field Support Center Office of ELL's. who  will deepen our work in relation Advanced Literacy's.   Our intention is to assess the resources and the professional development provided this year, and  use teacher feedback to improve aspects of future professional development. We will also take  advantage of professional development opportunities provided by the district.

We will create one-hour literacy workshops that will be take place once a month for the duration  of the program. Parents will also be invited into classrooms to observe instruction. The  workshops will be provided by ELL certified teachers, Kim Brown, Catherynne Ramirez and  Avril Aiken.   Workshops will include not only the components of the program, but guidance on how parents  can assist the program; for example by setting aside time for reading at home, and exposing  students to formal English outside of school.    Parents will be notified through bilingual written notification, contacted via telephone by  bilingual school personnel, and through student-parent communication.  We will also use a local  service organization, the Community Association of Progressive Dominicans to spread the word  about the program.    Primary provision of engagement activities will be led by our ELL Coordinator.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  I.S. 254 utilizes Degrees of Reading Power to measure reading comprehension. Departmental baseline assessments are used to  measure writing. ELLS are currently performing far below grade level with the average reading level at third grade.  NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores are used to guide instructional planning for ELLS.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Based on the outcomes of our formative assessments, we are able to develop a strategic instruction plan of action to improve  reading comprehension and move students towards reading on grade level. Aspects of the curriculum now include the use of  targeted reading instruction. For example, Tiered Intervention every day, which provides language support on individualized  text based on the Lexile level scaffolds (used to assist students in manuvering through complex Core Curriculum text.)     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The NYSESLAT, ELE, ELA and Math State exams, as well as the other interim assessments given throughout the year are used to  evaluate ELL student achievement. The success of the program is measured by using the following criteria: Checking the  number of students who are making progress, the degree of progress made, and the areas in which progress is being made  (speaking, reading, writing, and listening). Data generated from Spring 2017 NYSESLAT scores reveal the majority of our  students are either at the entering or expanding level.  Based on our current data students made the most progress and  perform the best on the speaking portion of the exam. Students made the least progress and achieve the lowest scores on the  writing portion of the exam.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The ELL department meets on a weekly basis to analyze data from summative assessments and discuss and implement next  steps.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   With the exception of newcomers--who were placed in their own classroom for RTI instruction-- students were placed in  classes based on their DRP levels. Teachers are following the Middle School Quality Initiative guidelines for Tiered Intervention,  including cycles of reading instruction that guide students through independent reading, whole class reading and group  reading at their individual level. Tier 1 interventions include the use of Lexia Core 5, a Rosetta Stone reading course for  beginners, as well as individual instruction with push-in teachers and paras. Tier 2 interventions include Lightsail, an ipad- based reading program that mirrors the DRP, yet utilizes high-interest novels and non-fiction books. Tier 3 interventions  include Newsela, an online reading program that utilizes high-interest news articles at readers Lexile levels.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Data patterns for students taking the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT show that the greatest number of students (70) are advanced  students, who have been unable to score at the Commanding level. We also have a large population of beginners (46). Futher  analysis of the NYSESLAT scores reveal that almost all of our students score higher in the areas of speaking and listening than  reading and writing. Writing is the area that the majority of students need the most assistance with.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Our ELL department meets on a weekly basis to disseminate these findings and make adjustments to curriculum.             Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   In our Freestanding ENL program, sixth, seventh and eighth grade students are programmed in one self-contained  class per grade level and receive ENL services from a push-in ELL teacher. Students are not newcomers, but have  mixed proficiency levels and travel together as a block. Students are also serviced by content area teachers with ELL  certification. ELL students who require a self-contained setting are grouped in self-contained classes with a licensed  special education teacher and a push-in ELL teacher.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Students in TBE travel together as a group by grade level and receive math and social studies in their native  language.  There is one bilingual class per grade level. The majority of students in the bilingual classes are at the  entering and emerging levels. In addition, these students receive ENL and ELA classes taught by certified ENL and  bilingual teachers. One HLA unit is personal narrative. The grade-level curriculum is adapted by bilingual and ELL  certified teachers.  On the sixth and seventh grade level the integrated classes are taught by a content-area teacher  with a certified ELL pushing in to ELA. On the eighth-grade level a certified ELL teacher teachers ELA to an integrated  class.    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      There is no dual language program at this time.    2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Entering and emerging students receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week. They have one unit of study in ENL taught by  a certified ESOL teacher and one unit of study in ELA taught by a certified ESOL teacher Our transitioning and expanding  students receive more than 180 minutes of instruction per week. They receive 1 unit of study in ELA with a certified ESOL  teacher and a 7-8 certified content area teacher. They also receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL during ELA.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   In the TBE program social studies and math are delivered in Spanish for newly arrived students. Other content areas are taught  by teachers certified in ENL or with ENL extensions. Science uses an inquiry model with hands-on practice, experiments and lab  work. Social Studies is regarded as study of non-fiction text and is generally taught by ELA teachers in a similar workshop  model (Read and respond to specific questions and write a short answer response) that incorporates more projects and  document-based questions (To be completed in Spanish and/or English for TBE students and English for ESL students). Science  and Social Studies are generally scheduled in 43 minute blocks. Across all subjects is an emphasis on academic vocabulary.  Instructional approaches include scaffolding, close reading, and use of visualization. A variety of materials support learning for  example, visual, physical, auditory and multimedia resources. Picture dictionaries and laptops are available as reference tools  and support. We also use graphic organizers, sentence stems and web-based programs for scaffolding.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   IS 254 schedules the ELE assessment. Also, ELLs are administered the Math and Science State exams in their native  languages.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Instruction is differentiated for SIFES in a variety of ways. Students work with paras and students teachers during class to meet  their needs and are assigned a reading instruction group at their level. We use a variety of print and online resources to  differentiate as well, including TCM materials, Writing Matters, Duolingo, Core5, Lightsail and Newsela.     Newcomers are placed in bilingual classes and receive instruction in their native language for two core subject areas: ELA and  Math.  In content area classes students are grouped and receive work based on ability and skill level. We use a variety of print  and online resources to differentiate as well, including TCM materials, Writing Matters, Duolingo, Core5, Lexia and Lightsail.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      Developing and long-term ELLs are assigned to reading groups based on their DRP scores. In those reading groups we use  an MSQI reading program, STARI. Instruction is also differentiated further by assigning students group work in content area  classes based on ability and skill level.     Former ELLs travel with the class that best meets their instructional needs. They are pulled out twice a week for additional  language support.       ELL students on NYS ELA and content-area assessments are allowed "time and a half."   • ELL students take the NYS ELA and content-area assessments in a separate location (all exams).  • Proctors read the listening passage three times to ELLs on grades 3-8 English Language Arts  assessments and on the Regents Comprehensive Examination in English.  • ELLs use bilingual glossaries when taking  State examinations in all subjects except languages other than English exams (LOTE).  • ELLs use both English and an alternative language edition of  content-area tests simultaneously.  • ELL students receive an oral translation of a state  examination when there is no translated edition provided by SED.      • ELL students make use of alternative language editions of state examinations and may write their responses to the open- ended question in their home languages.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers use National Geographic's ELL curriculum for ENL.  In ELA Teachers use the Common Core aligned program Expeditionary Learning with scaffolding using visuals, graphic  organizers, sentence frames, and word banks. Students listen to audio files of shared novels. Teachers are also using a web- based writing program, Writing Matters, which leads students through writing genres using visuals, audio and computer-based  instruction in the Writing Workshop Model.   Social Studies teachers use the TCM hybrid web and paper-based curriculum.   In math teachers use Engage NY supplemented by the computer-based IXL program and the Spanish language program, Math  in Focus.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Students are grouped within ICT and self-contained classes according to their language needs. In ICT classes two teachers  allows grouping by IEP needs. In both ICT and self-contained classes Instruction is modified for individual students with the use  of graphic organizers and online programs like Myon for reading, as well as Newsela. For students with IEPs there is an  increased focus on explicit teaching of vocabulary and word study.  Students were also tested by Degrees of Reading Power  and arranged into small groups by reading level for targeted instruction. This instruction includes Wilson reading and best  practices according to the Middle School Quality initiative framework for small group reading instruction.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in Math, ELA, and other content areas include: -Tiered Intervention which includes  Tiered Reading 5 periods a week - Saturday Academy for ELA and Math with strong emphasis on newcomers, ELLs with 4 or  more years of English and longterm ELLs - Socioemotional/academic counseling from the social worker with strong emphasis  on long term ELLs - All of these interventions are provided in Spanish and English with support in Spanish from bilingual  personnel, and after-school content-rich programming provided by ACDP.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      A strong push is being made for the following improvements to the instruction of ELLs at IS 254: - - Increased hiring of ENL  certified personnel and/or personnel with a strong performance record in teaching ELLs, especially ELL-SWDs. - A change in  programming/scheduling formats to allow for ELL students of high academic ability to take part in honors classes regardless of  self-contained ENL placement. - Increase of school based and outside professional development of teachers of ELLs. -  Improvement of our identification process and service of ELL parents.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Students are recruited for participation in after school programs through classroom presentations, postings, and strong  outreach to parents during school events, flyers, and parent calls. Equal access is afforded to all students and teachers are  instrumental in pushing for ELL participation. After school services available for ELLs include: Saturday Academy - students  participate in Math and ESL/ELA programs on Saturdays from 9-12pm. TASC /ACDP (Association Community of Progressive  Dominicans) - provide after school homework help and recreational programs such as health living( yoga, healthy eating habits  etc.), urban creation (addresses social issues through music and media), fashion, dance, and athletics (basketball, baseball,  soccer,etc.) 4 days a week. In addition, students participate in our arts in the middle grant which include trips to Lincoln Center  and school visits by performance artists.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  bilingual  IS 254 uses the following instructional materials to support the language development of our ESL and Bilingual students:  ENL: Newsela, an online reading and writing program, MYON, an online reading program, Duolingo, an online language  acquisition program for beginners  Social Studies: TCM, an online and paper-based curriculum  Math: IXL, Math in Focus and EngageNY  ELA: Expeditionary Learning, National Geographic's online ENL program and Writing Matters, an online program        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In the school library, native language support and development is delivered by allowing students the opportunity to explore  appropriate middle school level text in their native language (Spanish). Specific in the content area of math, students are  provided Spanish language textbooks and materials in alignment with the current curriculum. In Social Studies, students are  provided with literature and materials in the native language (Spanish) as a curricula support in reading and writing.  Students also use a Spanish-language math book, Math in Focus, to supplement EngageNY.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.      All required services/resources support and correspond to ELL's ages and grade levels as vetted by our ELL teachers, content  area teachers with bilingual extensions and our ELL coordinator. Materials span grades 4 to 8.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         Newly enrolled ELLs are welcomed with an orientation in their home language before school starts. Students are offered  activities through ACDP five days a week in their native language. During school hours Mr. Ramirez, an ELA teacher offers new  students clubs at lunch.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish is offered for eighth graders.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?           Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  ELL teachers engage in professional development on a weekly basis in grade and team planning meetings. These meetings are  for teachers to learn and apply new skills for helping ELLs, SWDs, and at-risk students. Topics of study for this school year  include the Writing Workshop model, reading assessments, Guided Reading, reading strategies for non-fiction text, and  academic vocabulary, small group reading instruction and incorporating reciprocal teaching and integration of technology.  In addition, our entire staff gathers for PD immediately after school every Monday and is engaged in cycles of learning.   Our first cycle (September-October) focused on coherent instruction. Our second cycle of PD (November-December)  focused on the Gradual Release of Responsibility model. Our third cycle of PD (January-February) focused on data driven  instruction and assessments. Our fourth cycle of PD (March-April) focused on ELL teaching strategies.   Professional development is provided within the school by teacher leaders, the literacy coach and assistant principals. All  subject teachers engage in outside professional development throughout the year. Topics for this year included Core  Curriculum Math and ELA standards, and differentiation and ELL strategies for the classroom. ELL teachers participated in  inter-visitation to non ELL classes that are proficient in the Common Core curriculum.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  In our grade and subject meetings, there is articulation across grade and content areas to discuss ELL instructional strategies  for the purpose of building ELL support across the curriculum. Workshops and conferences are provided to inform  differentiated professional development in critical areas. Teachers articulate, plan and share best practices. Regular subject  and grade meetings place emphasis on teachers' developing lesson plans that focus on the various performance indicators.  Agendas and attendance are kept for all professional development activities at the school. During our ENL department  meetings, bilingual and ENL teachers received ELL specific strategies for implementing and infusing within the curriculum best  practices in speaking, reading, and writing instruction for middle school English language learners.  Activities during  department meetings include: guided practice writing lessons using the gradual release model, guided practice adapting  curriculum, looking at students work and determining next steps, grouping students by data and designing appropriate  curriculum. New ENL teachers are coached by veteran teachers in the classroom and receive follow-up feedback after each  lesson.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         Starting this February, and for the remainder of the year, ENL teachers will receive ELL-specific professional development  during our regularly scheduled PD time, Monday after school. All Teachers will also go through a cycle of ELL-specific PD.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The school provides parental workshops and orientations in subject areas across the curriculum. The school also  communicates with parents about their child’s progress across the content areas. In addition, parents are provided with the  information and training needed to work with their children in order to improve their achievement levels in literacy. All  communication is provided in parents' native or preferred language. ELL parents are invited in to meet with parents on the  Monday of their choice from 2:30 to 3 to discuss goals of the program, language development progress, language proficiency  assessment results and language development needs. Teachers communicate directly with parents, as all ELL and bilingual  teachers speak Spanish. In the few cases necessary, non-certified ELL teachers speak French and can translate, as well.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Our PTA consists of ELL and non ELL parents/guardians. All parents/guardians including the parents/guardians of ELLs are  invited to attend parent workshops, PTA meetings and other meetings with staff and administration. Our Lincoln Center  partnership included two trips to Lincoln Center for ELL students and two performances at our school, which parents were  invited to attend. Parents are encouraged to participate in information meetings at the school and join in High School tours  and the district Middle School Fair so they are more fully aware of educational options for their children. The PTA reaches out  to get parents involved in planning, as well as, participating in these events. Parents are kept informed by letters and updated  calendars sent home by backpack and via phone calls. Translation services are used when necessary in communicating with  parents. In addition, a large number of our staff speaks Spanish.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.                                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Alexis Marrero, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   I.S. 254                                                                              School DBN: 254  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      In the office personnel speaks English and Spanish. If parents don't speak either of those languages than the  Language Access Card is used to determine the home language. If no one in the building can speak the language  indicated on the Language Access Card, the Language Access Coordinator calls the Language Access Center. In  addition we use the Home Language Survey, ATS reports (RAPL and the UPPG) to identify what language parents  speak and read.
