This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our mission statement declares: “We believe that every child can fulfill their potential one successful step at a time.  We believe that through personalized academic plans , students’ academic needs are addressed as we seek to  cultivate the strengths of each student within an interactive and safe learning community. Each student is provided  with a strong core curriculum supported by enriched educational possibilities that are barrier free and differentiated  to include a variety of learning experiences . We believe that 21st century skills developed within the context of  academic achievement will lead students to become successful and productive citizens.”       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.

We created Murray Hill Academy to create the learning conditions and opportunities for all students to have a  successful high school experience. Our school is founded on the following six Strategic Goals that we have based our  work on since the school opened in 2010:  #1: To improve student progress and achievement via monitoring mastery  based outcomes; #2: Literacy across curriculum and viable curricula; #3: Consistent high-quality Tier I instruction; #4:  Use of appropriate assessments in the classroom:    Strategic Goal #5: Ongoing collective analysis of student learning:    Strategic Goal #6: Individualized teacher support and supervision:      Our partnerships have been created understanding the “whole child” approach in mind:   ● Social and Emotional Support:    - Every student meets biweekly (or more often based on needs) with a support staff member (Guidance Counselor,  Social Worker, Attendance Teacher, Grade Team Member)   - Active collaboration with the Gotham Health on our Campus   - Peer Mediation   - Grade Team Advisory Sessions once a month   - Grade Team support with Academic mindset thinking and day to day teacher interaction   - Academic Behaviors assessed in all classes (Note Taking, Organization, Persistence, Self Starting)   ● College And Career Readiness:    - Dedicated College and Career Adviser   - Collaboration with CollegeBoard   - Grade Team Advisers meet with their students weekly for academic support and goal setting   - College Now -Program   - AP for All Program   - College Access for All   - NYC Service Speed Mentoring   - PENCIL (Principal for a Day Program)     - Alumni from College visits to 9th Grade classes   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      - Co-Op Tech -Program   - iLearn/Blended Learning programs   - National Honor Society   - Partnership with W!se- Freshmen Formula 8 week workshops on professionalism    - Various Professional workshops with W!se- including networking and resume building at Goldman Sachs   ● Mentoring/Student Leadership building:   - Big Brothers and Big Sisters (Weil, Gotshal & Manges and Price Waterhouse Coopers))    - Chris Canty Foundation   - Student Government    - Partnership with W!se- Freshmen Formula 8 week workshops on professionalism    - Human Rights Commission - Mentoring Program   ● Hands On Learning Experiences/Individualized Tutoring:    - STARS (includes tutoring, Regents’ and SAT preparation)   - American Museum of Natural Arts   - Green Team   - Student School Service Interns   - Paw Print Newspaper   - Yearbook   - All advisory groups take one experiential learning trip at the start of the year   - Content specific trips   ● Creative Outlets:   - Visual Arts Club    - After school piano classes by Piano School of New York   - Student Activities Club (COSA)   -CityArts Mural Painting   - LEAP visiting Artist Program   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      - Piano Club    ● Physical Activity:   -Boys’ Basketball Varsity/JV; Girls’ Basketball Varsity/JV; Boys’ Baseball - Varsity/JV; Girls’ Softball – Varsity; Girls’  Volleyball – Varsity;    - After School Sports Club and Soccer   ● Teacher/Leadership Instructional Support:   - High Schools That Work   - New Teacher Center trained mentors in school   - AP for All Program mentoring    - Subject Area Lead Glow and Grows   - Learning Partners Instructional Walk-throughs and Inter-school visitations       School strengths:   ● We have a strong College Going Culture. Here are some examples of how we build college interest and culture into  students every day thinking:    - College Fairs (at MHA, SUNY, MFSC, etc)   - Junior/Senior Assemblies- alumni return to discuss "What I wish I knew as a Junior" and student led panel discussion   - College Application Week to promote college readiness and meet individually with each senior to complete a college  application   - Financial Aid Day   - “Ask Me About My College” Day   - College Gear/Color Day   - “I Applied!” Sticker Day   - Anxiety/Stress Workshop   - Senior Cram Sessions   - SAT days at MHA   - College Commitment Day Luncheon   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      - MHA Alumni Home coming   - Senior Activities (trips, prom, photos, yearbook, etc.)   - College trips per grade, starting when students enter MHA   - Grade Ambassadors   - Goal setting workshops    - College Visits starting at the 9th grade through 12th grade   - Freshmen Formula Professionalism Workshops    ● Our students have enrolled in College Now taking the following courses: English Composition 101; Physics; Speech;  Psychology; Sociology; Chemistry; Citizenship and Public Service.    ● We have broadened our course offerings to include 4 Advanced Placement courses (AP US History, AP  Environmental Science, AP Language and Composition and AP Statistics), advanced mathematics (Algebra  2/Trigonometry), as well as new electives such as Speech and Communication, Meteorology, Planet Earth, Creative  Writing, Mural Making, etc. 2 courses have been applied to be certified as "College Level" courses: English 8 and  Algebra 2/Trigonometry.    ● Our seniors have been accepted to over 150 universities and colleges, (including Skidmore College, UCLA, Howard  University, Stony Brook, NYU Polytechnic Institute, Penn State, SUNY Potsdam, Fordham University, Rutgers  University, School of Visual Arts, Parsons School of Design, Baruch College, Hunter College, Brooklyn College, SUNY  Stonybrook, George Mason University, American University, etc)!   ● Our students have received so far over $300,000 in scholarships from post-secondary institutions (not including  financial aid grants and/or loans)! This means a lot to our students who are in average 80% Economically  Disadvantaged.    ● We take pride in engaging our students in hands on learning. For example, in 2017-18 our students in all grades  were offered the different workshop learning opportunities: USS Intrepid Trip, Liberty Science Center Trip, Plum  Beach Clean Up Trip, 9/11 Museum,/NASDAQ Field Trip, American Museum of Natural History (Transcendentalism),  New York Historical Society Field Trip, Brooklyn Museum David Bowie Field Trip, Pulitzer Prize Announcement Trip,  Bloomberg News Headquarters Trip, Math Museum Trip.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our challenge is to meet all the needs of our learners, who come to us with level 1 and 2 in ELA (72%), and level 1 and  2 in Math (89%). In addition, 26% of our students have Individualized Education Plans (IEP). We take our learners into  consideration when planning in teams for interventions inside and outside of the classroom, and when planning how  to best scaffold, support and create entry points in the lessons. Administration and the staff take our student  population into consideration when programming for classes and creating team teaching classes, not only for ICT  classes. We design our professional development around the student, school and teacher needs and interests.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Collaborative Teachers: “Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in PD within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.”   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      In 2017-18, our Instructional focus was Lesson Study. The objective of Lesson Study was to create structured  occasions for teachers to examine teaching and learning. The focus of Lesson Study was to improve the lesson  planning process, refine instructional strategies and delivery, evaluate results, evaluate student thinking, and increase  student mastery. During the course of this school wide instructional focus, each department was able to discover new  classroom strategies (collaboratively planned) and then visit each others' classrooms to see these protocols and  strategies in action. One such strategy was using a "Murder-Mystery" activity to teach student the need for  supporting evidence to write effective essays in Global History.    In 2018-19, we will improve this practice to include more student voice and focus on student engagement in the  classroom. This means that students will take part in the process of guiding how they are assessed, as well as what  they are learning. Teachers will use the Lesson Study Process to refine their classroom practices to make this goal  achievable.    Additionally, as part of AP for All program we believe in creating access to rigorous courses for all students. Expanding  access to Advanced Placement will help our students get familiar with advanced course work and earn the skills they  will need in college. This year we have added AP Statistics to our existing AP Courses (AP US History, AP  Environmental Science and AP Language and Composition).    Teacher Collaboration is directly connected to high-quality instruction and student achievement. We will continue to  work with our teachers to support them in acquiring skills and expertise by providing opportunities for them to  develop, grow, and learn from peers and experts. Therefore, we will continue our work of aligning CCLS and Next Gen  Standards to our Mastery Based System of Assessment. This mean that 1) Teachers will have curriculum and  assessments aligned to a set of standards (Common Core / Next Gen); will give feedback and grades to students which  are linked directly to progress on standards. 2) Students will understand the expectation for their learning in each unit  in each class; will be clear on where their grades come from and what their grades mean in terms of their progress  towards expectations and learning targets. We will continue to go deeper into our mastery based learning by  including daily learning targets for each lesson. These learning targets were learned collaboratively in subject areas.  Teachers then designed learning targets collaboratively, taught the lesson, and collaboratively discussed their  reflections and questions for further investigation. This was shared out as a full staff in September 2018.    At MHA we form teacher teams to assist with our alignment of assessments to the curricula. At the beginning of each  unit teachers utilize pre-assessments to help guide their instructional practice and to both narrow (or broaden) the  scope of instruction and then to differentiate instruction. This allows a teacher to gain critical insights into how their  work might be received, understood, and completed. Since planning is an ongoing process, this may take the form of  revising the unit, the assessments, and even which standards are most appropriate to align with instructions.   The units themselves are aligned to the CCLS / Next Gen standards with Mastery Based assessments in mind to ensure  that instruction is rigorous in accordance with the vision of instruction at MHA (rigorous, individualized, and  continually assessed). Students will be given the opportunity to demonstrate mastery towards expectations with  multiple "practice" activities and assessments before give a chance to demonstrate mastery in an assessment that will  be sued to gauge progress and to move on to subsequent standards.    Teachers plan for possible student misconceptions and should have multiple entry points and questioning developed  before instruction begins. This allows teachers to make adjustments to the lesson as it progresses. By checking for  understanding during the lesson (student response to teacher questions, student questions, class activities, exit  activities and summaries) teachers are better able to assess in the moment student learning to further fine tune the  lesson. Part of this process is for teachers to assess instruction as it happens, before after and during instruction. This  can include such practices as shared out relevant entrance activities (do now), class share out of practice problems,  real time assessment of problems/work provided during class, desk side conferences, pair work, group share outs, etc.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14      The teaching and learning process will lead to reflection on the part of each teacher to reassess the lessons executed  during the unit and either re-teach the skills as a class, small groups or individually, with extension assignments, work  during STARS (afternoon tutoring) or independent work options and tutoring.   Students are part of this process as well, as they are given the opportunity to self-assess through the use of end of  lesson/unit reflections, goal setting, and task sheets that recognize academic behavior, as well as acquisition of key  skills that are being demonstrated throughout the lesson and unit.    Our key area of focus for this year is "Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and  aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious  intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills." Our instructional focus is "Through planning,  communication, instruction, and continuous assessment of student friendly learning targets in daily lessons, teachers  will effectively increase student engagement and mastery of course standards." By creating clear, daily, learning  targets for students we are helping to communicate clear expectations for students, a research based strategy that  helps to improve student achievement. This ties to rigorous instruction by supporting students in understanding the  clear, high, expectations of daily lessons and how they connect to the unit goals and assessments. We will be  partnering with 2 other schools as part of the Learning Partners Program to go through several cycles of inquiry in  order to ensure rigorous instruction is set for all students as we begin discussions around racial equity in order to  ensure all students are receiving rigorous instruction and meeting the standards set by the teacher. In order to do  this, we will participate in inter-school visits, complete cycles of inquiry as the PD team/LPP team, and grade teams  will complete a Root Cause Analysis Protocol with a lens of racial equity tied to rigorous instruction and credit  accumulation. In addition, teachers will continue to complete cycles of inquiry using MHA's lesson inquiry protocol as  they collaboratively design highly effective lessons to assess efficacy of strategies to ensure all students reach  mastery.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 02M432   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   317   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     This goal was developed in alignment with the NYCDOE’s Framework for Great Schools. All students will experience  Common Core-aligned rigorous and responsive learning experiences and instruction across subject areas. As reflected  in Quality Review Area 1.1 (Ensuring engaging, rigorous and coherent curricula in all subject areas...) Murray Hill  Academy has identified the need to continue to work on common classroom practices, and instructional strategies  that will ensure students uniformly experience high level, rigorous instruction.    The need for this can be further evidence by the following data:   ● 89% of our incoming freshmen are level 1 and 2 based on the NYS 8 th Grade Mathematics Assessment    ● 72% of our incoming freshmen are level 1 and 2 based on the NYS 8 th Grade ELA Assessment   According to the student perception survey, over 80% of teachers believe they give challenging work, but less than  60% of students believe they are challenged in classes.    A strength of Murray Hill Academy in addressing this need is reflected within Quality Review Area - 4.2 "Engage in  structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared leadership and  focuses on improved student learning".   In this sense, MHA is positioned to create meaningful change through teacher teams and collaborative efforts, as we  were rated as Well Developed in this category.

Reviewing student perception surveys with teachers during end of the year (June 2018) conferences, students often  reflected on a low level of classroom engagement. Only 57% of students felt engaged in classroom work and this  varied from teacher to teacher with some seeing engagement as low as 37% (as reported by their students.    Additionally, during our most recent Quality Review (February 2018), the students reported in meetings with the  quality reviewer that they would like more of an active role in decisions made at the school, such as Student  Government and feedback that impacted instruction.    Additionally, as evidenced by our most recent Quality Review (QR Indicator 1.2 Pedagogy). The Reviewer writes,  "Across the vast majority of the classes, students were engaged in meaningful discourse with each other. Students  were encouraged to justify their thinking by providing an explanation and making connections to the content using  personal and real world applications. A Geometry class began with students making predictions and brainstorming  with their classmates to determine how to design a model. Students recorded their calculations and tried to ascertain  calculations. Students worked collaboratively to verify the measure of the vertical angle based on their predictions.  However, at times there were some missed opportunities for students to engage in extended high level discourse." As  reflected by this, our school has the tools in place to create an engaging classroom environment and  increase/leverage student voice, but our practices need to be strengthened and broadened.    As part of the Framework for Great Schools, the need for Classroom Engagement and Student voice can be seen  within the elements of both Supportive Environments and Rigorous Instruction. One of our strengths to be capitalized  on in regards to the Framework is Collaborative Teachers and Pedagogy and these will be part of addressing the  expressed need.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, 90% of the staff will have implemented instructional strategies and protocols in their classrooms and  advisory sessions that support students’ Academic Behaviors (SMART goals/self-reflection, persistence, study skills,  and conferencing). The goal is to deepen students’ learning and further their self-reflection and engagement in the  learning process.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22      This will be evidenced in the lesson plans and team meeting minutes which will indicate that teachers are planning  more engaging lessons and implementing them in the classroom.

We have chosen this to be a priority area for providing all our students high quality Common Core aligned instruction  across subject areas in order to meet the needs of diverse learners in alignment with the NYCDOE’s Framework for  Great Schools. The second reason for this goal is to regularly and collaboratively look for areas for teacher strength  and growth in teacher practice in order to create sustainable systems for support.   As detailed in our most recent Quality Review (March 2018), our Area of Focus is Indicator 1.2, Pedagogy (although  we were rated "Well Developed"), - "Across the vast majority of classes, the continuum of questioning and student  work products are aligned to the curricula and reflect student discussion of complex topics." As noted by the Quality  Reviewer: "Student work and opportunities for classroom text-based discussions reflect high levels of student thinking  about complex tasks and participation. However, there were some missed opportunities for extended high-level  discourse."   In terms of the Framework for Great Schools, this is part of our strength in that we have built a community of trust  and collaboration and build a solid foundation for this work to continue. We will continue to focus additionally on the  framework item of rigorous instruction, outlined in the Framework for Great Schools, as we move forward to achieve  this goal.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Currently we are using the following strategies for increased parental involvement:    ● Parent workshops on varying topics, for example, financial aid for students    ● Parent meetings with teachers and staff to discuss college and career readiness, academic progress and behavior    ● Parents are invited to join students to visit colleges   ● Parents access students’ data through JumpRope which is an online grading, attendance and student progress  system for student information   ● We host a “back to school” and curriculum night in addition to two yearly parent teacher conferences. During these  events the parents are informed about the CCLS shifts in the curriculum and instructional strategies that we use at  MHA.   ● Parents are informed on how to use JumpRope, and internet by the school staff   ● Frequent phone or email communication with parents regarding their children’s academic and behavioral progress   ● Invitation of parents to school functions and to visit the school during the day to see our everyday functions.   ● School website with access to school information 24/7   Our need is to increase parent participation in students’ college and career awareness and preparedness process.    After working diligently on this goal, as reflected in our most recent Quality Review (February 2018) we have  progressed from a Proficient to a "Well Developed". As parents report: "During the meeting with families, they all  shared that they are regularly invited to workshops and conferences, where they learn about expectations for their  children. They noted that staff members communicate expectations to them through text messages, telephone calls,  emails, curriculum nights, open house events, and the school website. Several added that they receive a monthly  newsletter, which offers an overview of curricula and reminds them of expectations for class work and homework.".   This reports a strength of our school in communicating, especially, with families on a one to one basic, but we  continue to need to improve our participation in school wide events.    This is a clear value and an important component of The Framework for Great Schools, as articulated in the element  of Strong Family-Community Ties.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties.

Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population.   Title I set-aside funds are used primarily for educational services to ensure homeless youth progress academically.  Due to the different and changing needs of the homeless population, we also assist with emergency supplies (school  supplies, books, glasses, etc.). These students and their families can participate in the after school programs,  counseling services, and parental involvement activities. We provide students a safe place to study beyond school  hours if their current location does not offer them computer access or facilities that are study friendly. We take into  consideration each student’s individual needs and assist them accordingly.      Part B: FOR NON-TITLE I SCHOOLS   1.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  We use the following strategies to attract highly qualified teachers:    ● We participate in Teacher Hiring Fairs, group interviews with teaching fellows, and ensuring administration, teacher  leaders, and students are part of the interview process.    ● Our teachers get the latest technology (laptops, Smartboard, etc.) and online curriculum in their classrooms for  individual instructional use.   ● The supervision uses proactive and differentiated supervision for the staff (formal and informal observations, peer  observation and inter-visitations).   ● Teachers have New Teacher Mentoring and individualized coaching from our support organizations.   ● Our teachers participate in professional development at school and off-site. The professional development is  targeted to individual teacher’s needs as well as our students’ and organizational needs. Teachers have opportunities  to share experiences with and learn from colleagues in our Network, with iZone360/iLearn schools, as well as,  nationally with High Schools That Work, and other organizations.   ● We believe in capacity building within our staff. We encourage everyone to take on leadership roles ranging from  running a student club to becoming a Grade Team or Subject Area Leader, or to continue their education and advance  in their careers.   In order to ensure that our staff will be 100% high quality teachers we are doing the following:   ● We advise our staff about available teacher certification programs   ● We hire high quality teachers through Open Hire, Student Teachers, Teaching Fellows and NYCDOE Teacher Fairs   ● Our teachers participate in professional development on academic rigor and other Danielson Framework  components.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      ● Our new teachers are mentored by Coaches and New Teacher Mentors   ● Teachers engage in self-reflection via Individual Growth Plans and Yearly Reviews.   Murray Hill Academy’s professional development program includes trainings and workshops based on individual  teacher needs and interests as well as student and school needs. For example:   ● Teachers are surveyed regarding their planning, instructional and assessment, and classroom management needs  before the school year starts.   ● Technology and software training including; Achieve3000, EdGenuity, TI-83, SmartBoard, JumpRope   ● Common Core State Standards, unit planning, development and alignment by NYCDOE, High Schools That Work  (HSTW), and AP for All   ● The Danielson’s Framework for Teaching, Bloom’s Taxonomy and Webb’s DOK    ● Career Choices curriculum for college and career awareness    ● Differentiated Instruction for ELL Students (HSTW )   ● Guidance Counselor PDs (NYCDOE)        2b.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The common understanding is that teachers need to know about their students’ progress and difficulties with learning  so that they can adapt their own work to meet the needs of all students in their classes. We believe that a  collaborative inquiry process is a key lever in improving student achievement (Instructional Inquiry Cycle with multiple  teams: Look at student work/data - Look at teacher work - Engage external resources - Set goals and take action -  Monitor and track progress ). We create a yearly Assessment Plan in order to chart the work of department and grade  teams, as well as the whole school community. The plan includes:    ● Subject baseline exams   ● Student assessment supports   ● Mastery Based Assessment Systems   ● Key Assessments   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      ● Data Days (Student goal setting, MOSL targets, Grade Team goals) and guiding questions   ● Summative Assessment Framework   ● Formative Assessment Framework   ● MOSL selections   ● Grade Team Smart Goals   - Instructional walkthroughs with PD team and grade team leaders   - Data Analysis in grade teams related to credit accumulation    We use Mastery Based assessments in each subject to periodically (every term) measure student proficiency and  progress across subject areas on a set of skills that align to Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) for each grade- level. These assessments provide a lens for identifying some of the skills and concepts from the grade and subject that  may need to be reinforced in upcoming units if students are to meet the CCLS expectations for each grade/subject.      MHA teacher teams collaborate to align the assessments to the curricula. At the beginning of each unit teachers  utilize pre-assessments to help guide their instructional practice and to both narrow (or broaden) the scope of  instruction and to differentiate instruction. This allows a teacher to gain critical insights into how their work might be  received, understood, and completed. Since planning is an ongoing process, this may take the form of revising the  unit, the assessments, and which standards are most appropriate to align with instruction.   The units themselves are aligned to the CCLS with Mastery Based assessments in mind to ensure that instruction is  rigorous in accordance with the vision of instruction at MHA (rigorous, individualized, and continually assessed).   Mastery Based assessments are designed to focus the instruction towards a common meeting point for students, but  to also elevate instruction to a level that is challenging students to continually reach above their comfort zones.    The teacher teams will create tasks towards the completion of the Mastery Based assessments, but along the way  create practice assessments in the form of in-class work, conferences, quizzes, projects, labs, etc. This work is  collected and analyzed individually and as teams to ensure that instruction has accomplished the goal of supporting  student progress with individual and shared skills. Towards the end of the cycle this data is collected to document  how many students have accomplished meeting the standards assessed by the Mastery Based assessments. However,  even students that have not met the standards may have shown growth and will be appropriately encouraged  (growth mindset).   Teachers plan for possible student misconceptions and have alternative pathways and questioning developed before  instruction begins. This allows them to make adjustments to the lesson as it progresses. By checking for  understanding during the lesson (student response to teacher questions, student questions, class activities, exit  activities and summaries) teachers are better able to assess in the moment student learning to further fine tune the  lesson. This can include such practices as shared out relevant entrance activities (do now), class share out of  homework problems, real time assessment of problems/work provided during class, desk side conferences, pair work,  group share outs, etc. This will lead to reflection on the part of each teacher to reassess the lessons executed during  the unit and either re-teach the skills as a class, small groups or individually, with extension assignments, work during  STARS (afternoon tutoring) or independent work options and tutoring. Students are part of this process as well, as  they are encouraged and given the opportunity to self-assess through the use of end of lesson/unit reflections, goal   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      setting, and task sheets that recognize academic behavior, as well as acquisition of key skills that are being  demonstrated throughout the lesson and unit.    Our teacher teams and the support staff meet weekly together during the common planning time to improve the  achievement of individual students in a form of case conferencing. In addition, we do the following:   ● Use 8 th grade ELA and Mathematics NYS assessment results to identify the needs of incoming ninth graders.   ● Work with teachers on gathering data in the classroom.   ● Review summative and formative assessments to determine student performance on an individual, class, cohort  and school level.   ● Teacher teams meet to adjust instruction for improved student performance.   ● Set up data inquiry teams focusing on improving student performance and teacher teaching strategies.   ● In the classroom, students have face to face instruction combined with online curriculum and activities. Teachers  use one on one, small group or whole group instruction in lessons. This model supports multiple opportunities for  timely support and interventions.   ● Students are offered tutoring and small group support during and after school      Teachers are part of the decision making process in the following ways:   ● Daily meeting at the beginning of each day that is teacher led and an opportunity to share thoughts and concerns.    ● Monthly Cabinet meetings that include teacher leaders (subject team leaders and grade team leaders) in which  school wide goals are discussed.    ● Common Planning time set aside during each school day for teacher teams to meet and collaborate. These meetings  are documented with meeting minutes and communicated to administration. These questions and concerns are then  addressed in Cabinet Meetings.   ● Professional Activity Time is often teacher led, where best practices are shared, concerns are raised and the staff  has an opportunity to lend it's voice to the process.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53        Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Murray Hill Academy, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      MURRAY HILL ACADEMY will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   MURRAY HILL ACADEMY , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act  (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by  Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our ENL mission is to provide every ELL student equal access to the English Curriculum and to ensure all students succeed in all  content areas. As a high school we use Achieve 3000 and Scantron EdPerformance to gain insight into our students' reading,  writing and comprehension levels. Based on this data, teachers plan instruction taking into consideration students' specific  needs and strengths in order to personalize the instruction. It also helps teachers to set a baseline for each student in order to  measure growth. We use Scantron EdPerformance to assess early literacy levels, and supplement this exam for students who  do not score higher than 3rd grade level with individual conferencing. The ENL class focuses on areas of struggle identified  through these assessments.       2.

What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our ENL program has succeeded if our students:   1. Improve in English language proficiency as measured by progress on the NYSESLAT   2. Succeed academically in their content classes as evidenced by content area pass rates and   3. Develop confidence, and a positive identity with their cultural heritage and the community.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We have structures in different areas (for example, learning environment, professional development, academic language  development, collaborative learning, effective feedback) to address interventions in the classroom:     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The largest number of ENLs are in the 9th (9 Expanding, 0 Transitioning) and 10th (5 Expanding, 2Transitioning). Data also  reveals that 10 of the 21 ENLs have an IEP. Our ELLs are making steady gains on the assessment by moving to the next level of  proficiency in order to become more language proficient. After the ELA Regents Exam, 1 student became a former ELL.  After  the 2016 NYSESLAT exam, 70% of the students improved their scores: 20% tested Proficient, 50% of the students went up a  level, and 30% of the students stayed on the same level. Our ENLs are making steady gains on the assessment by moving to the  next level of proficiency in order to become more language proficient. NYSITELL was given to one student based on his Home  Language Survey responses. Student scored Proficient.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   In order to make adjustments to our programs we disseminate findings from outcome assessments data in regular grade team,  subject area, cabinet, morning roll call, special education, ENL meetings, Mid-Year Review, and End of Year Reflection  meetings.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   We have 21 ENL students grades 9-12 of which 15 are Expanding level and 2 student is Transitioning level and 3 did  not take the NYSESLAT exam. 17 of 21 are long term ENLs. Data also reveals that 10 of the 22 ENLs have an IEP.  Students are provided integrated ENL support in content area classes in alignment wit CR. Part 154.2 by an ENL  /subject area teacher and a Special Education teacher with a bilingual extension. Students are grouped based on their  instructional needs and strengths homogeneously or heterogeneously using purposeful and flexible grouping.  Because of our small numbers, teachers know the specific needs of our students and can group them within the class  and differentiate assignments and instruction accordingly.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         During integrated ENL sessions in content area classes, ENL students are supported in several ways, such as  vocabulary development and language structures and functions specific to the needs of the content-area classroom in  order to improve writing; graphic organizers and reading strategy support to improve reading, accountable talk with  the ENL teacher and classmates in order to improve speaking, and various listening supports.    We created an Art  History course designed to immerse students in English language skills with an ENL/subject area teacher and a  content area teacher.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?            We have 21 ENL students grades 9-12 of which 15 are Expanding level and 2 student is Transitioning level and 3 did not  take the NYSESLAT exam. Expanding and Transitioning students required total of 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week.  These minutes are delivered in the following manner: ENLs receive required number of minutes a week in language instruction  in an integrated ENL class one period per day (52 min/day). During the integrated ENL classes, ENL students are supported in  several ways, such as vocabulary development and language structures and functions specific to the needs of the content-area  classroom in order to improve writing; graphic organizers and reading strategy support to improve reading, accountable talk  with the ENL teacher and classmates in order to improve speaking, and various listening supports.   ENL students also receive  intensive reading support using Achieve3000, which allows students to self-monitor their progress.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Our program model comprises integrated ENL classes based on student proficiency levels as of NYSESLAT 2016. ENL  instruction is delivered in English.   In the content areas, teachers work and plan with co-teachers and adapt lessons so that they are more accessible to the ENL  students. They scaffold the instruction, make modifications where needed to accommodate the student's reading and  language acquisition level. They explain the vocabulary (front loading), modify the pacing and suggest strategies to successfully  complete assignments. The focus is on literacy as well as language acquisition skills. Differentiation is a critical component for  content area instruction, not only in the English class but in mathematics, social studies, and science. In accordance with the  Common Core Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing Standards, ENLS will be provided with targeted scaffolding, pacing,  instructional modifications and vocabulary play a key role in rolling out new concepts and most particularly in word problems.  Additional strategies are:           ---note taking from a supplementary text, using the Cornell model for note taking,           ---summarizing and strengthening academic language in the content areas,           ---paraphrasing when writing paragraphs and close exercises.   These targeted scaffolding strategies will ensure that ENL students are able to demonstrate content knowledge, while  improving their Language Acquisition.           Technology is blended into classroom instruction, as an additional instructional tool and resource throughout all of the  classes. By having access to the internet and on-line resources our ENL students are able to develop their skills to the fullest  and not denied an opportunity to be prepared for the career and college demands of the 21st Century. ENL students are  supported with Achieve 3000, a research-based technology program to improve reading comprehension and vocabulary  building.   In mathematics, the focus is on decoding word problems, defining the mathematical vocabulary used. Students create word  walls to support this process. Instruction is differentiated as are assignments, homework and tests. There is peer tutoring in  class and after school tutoring.   In science we also have word walls to build content vocabulary. There is differentiated instruction to accommodate the various   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      reading levels. There is peer tutoring during class and labs as well as after school tutoring. There are numerous charts and  posters that students use as a reference for completing labs and class work assignments.   In social studies, there are word wall, time lines, charts and posters that support the content area and language acquisition.  Teachers and the ENL Coordinator meet during common planning to case conference,suggest strategies and monitor student  growth.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      If the student is a first entrant to NYC they are eligible to take the NYSITELL. Students are tested annually with the NYSESLAT  to measure growth. For students who are literate in their native language, they can take the NYS Regents Examinations in their  native language or use the native language version side by side with the English version and those exams can be graded by  teachers proficient in those languages.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    6a. SIFE students come with missed years of official school instruction. As a result, they are often illiterate in their home  language as well as in English. These students must learn English, pass their classes and pass the NYS regents’ exams. In order  to address their academic needs we will offer them tutoring, online programs for credit recovery, reading programs for  literacy, and counseling. In addition, we select for them age and interest appropriate materials. They are older and need more  social and emotional interventions to keep them in school in order to graduate high school. In addition, our SIFE students will  be provided with the appropriate testing modifications for ENL students. These students are all assigned a counselor to  support academic behaviors. Within content classes, teachers plan supports with the ENL teacher and the ICT special  education teacher. Individual support is provided in after-school and Saturday tutoring.      6b. ENL students that have been in the US for less than three years must pass the NYS ELA regents’ exams as well as the  NYSESLAT assessment. They are provided accelerated instruction, more tutorials, and before school, after school, and Saturday  tutoring. They will also use online programs with teacher support, such as Achieve3000 and Reading Horizons. Within content  classes, teachers plan supports with the ENL teacher and the ICT special education teacher. Individual support is provided in  after-school and Saturday tutoring.     6c. ENL students that have been receiving services for 4-6 years are at risk of becoming long term ENLs. They are given more  electives focusing on the literacy as well as content, interest and appropriate reading levels. That can be accomplished by  offering electives such as Computer Literacy and Career Exploration which are language intensive with hands-on approach.  Within content classes, teachers plan supports with the ENL teacher and the ICT special education teacher. Individual support  is provided in after-school and Saturday tutoring.    6d. Long Term ENL students with more than six year of service are more likely to drop out of high school according to  national statistics. Therefore, in addition to increased support for language acquisition and credit accumulation, they are also  engaged in goal setting and post secondary planning. We provide all the students with IEPs appropriate special education  services so that they can get the support that they need and transitional planning for post secondary living.      6e. Transitional support will be provided on a student by student basis taking into consideration their individual needs. They  will receive the support of the ENL teacher and the College and Career Advisor, as well as the support of the whole faculty and  their peers. Teachers will scaffold their work and use timely assessment in order to offer interventions and enrichments as  needed.For ENLs who test out, they still get extended time on class and state exams, for two years and the use of dictionaries,  glossaries and tutoring. Former ENLs are provided the appropriate testing modifications. They are also supported via  counseling, after school groups, tutoring and mentoring.  All Former ENLs will be provided with additional support in  Integrated ENL classes, for 90 minutes in alignment with CR, Part 154.2.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our instructional strategies and grade level materials for ELL-SWDs follows the recommendations of the individual student’s  IEP. These can include speech and hearing therapy as well as counseling services for the required times and group size as  mandated. In addition all testing modifications are followed including additional time, separate location, a reader and/or  writer as well as extended time and the use of a dictionary and/or glossary. Specific IEP recommendations related to English  language supports and targeted skills are followed. All of our ELL students who have been identified as special needs students  are all in integrated collaborative team teaching classes (ICT) with a special education teacher and the licensed content area  teacher. ELLs are provided with Native Language materials whenever possible, specifically when teaching content to ensure  greater understanding. This includes sample Regents Tasks.   The teachers plan lessons that are scaffolded, allow for differentiated instruction and build time into the lesson to allow for  small group and individual student supports. There will be tutoring to support students who need more time on task, in  preparation for passing the NYSESLAT exam. The focus of both instruction and tutoring is to prepare students to pass NYS  Regents Exams. We also will use technology as a tool to support differentiated instruction and individualized learning goals.  Our teachers use differentiated content area texts such as Prentice Hall Mathematics. In addition, teachers have developed  classroom libraries with age-appropriate high-interest texts at varying reading levels. Achieve3000 also provides individual  students with grade-level appropriate material based on previous assessment.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school uses curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least  restrictive environment. Our school psychologist works with our special education staff to follow all appropriate procedures to  develop an appropriate IEP. Our flexibly scheduling model allows us to tailor the students' ICT classes to content areas in which  the IEP team has recommended. All of the students with IEPs are in ICT classes which have two teachers, the content area  specialist and the special education teacher who accommodates the students needs and his/her learning style. Technology,  laps tops and on-line programs such as Achieve 3000 and Apex are used to differentiate and support instruction according to  each students' language acquisition needs. Our Special Education Coordinator works closely with the ESL teacher to determine  how ESL instruction can support content area needs as well as individual student needs. In addition, we have programmed in  Independent Study classes during the day, that can be used for any additional pull out or push in services such speech, hearing,  counseling, and Achieve3000, Reading Horizons and extended time to complete tests, essays, reports and lab reports.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  We support our ELL students by offering them Achieve3000 additional instructional help, counseling, speech, and hearing  services. The teacher dedicated for our ENL classes does push in and pull out depending on the needs of the individual  students in the content area classes. The school has an ICT program for special education students, long-term ELLs and the 4-6  year ELLs. We have are seven teachers certified in special education, covering mathematics, ELA, science and social studies.  Students have extended time on exams, the opportunity to correct and make-up missing assignments and improve class test  scores. There is also the opportunity for differentiated work products that still meet rigorous academic standards. ELLs with  IEPs are in one or more ICT classes, where there is a special education teacher to provide extra help and to scaffold lessons.  The targeted intervention programs are offered in English. Selected examples of interventions across the subject areas are as  follows:      Math: For example, ELL students practice organization of ideas and concepts through a visual, teacher-modeled “interactive  notebook”.  Criteria for determining targeted support services are entering Math and ELA state assessment levels (level 1 and  low 2); Baseline Exams (not meeting standard); Student progress in the subject (not meeting standard); Regents’ data (not  passing); Benchmark assessment data (not meeting standard); Term grades (not passing); IEP goals (not meeting the goals);  NYSESLAT levels; and Attendance data (below 70%). The strategies used are: Scaffolded supports; Strategic Learner/Reader  strategies; Graphic organizers; Questioning strategies; ICT classes; Fuel Education self-paced study programs; and Independent   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      study class in a lab setting with one-on-one teacher instructional support in English and selective Spanish supports.      Science: Criteria for determining targeted support services are entering state assessment levels (level 1 and low 2); Baseline  Exams (not meeting standard); Student progress in the subject (not meeting standard); Regents’ data (not passing);  Benchmark   assessment data (not meeting standard); Term grades (not passing); IEP goals (not meeting the goals); NYSESLAT  levels (tested not Proficient); and Attendance data (below 70%). The strategies we use are Leveled texts with scaffolded  supports; Strategic Learner/Reader strategies; Graphic organizers; Questioning strategies; ICT classes; Fuel Education self- paced study programs; Independent study class in a lab setting with one-on-one teacher instructional support in English and  selective Spanish support.      ELA: For example, ELL students participate in meaningful peer academic talk and student to student collaboration through  work on collaborative posters to interpret ideas, make claims, and present supporting evidence. Criteria for determining  targeted support services are entering Math and ELA state assessment levels (level 1 and low 2); Baseline Exams (not meeting  standard);   Student progress in the subject (not meeting standard); Regents’ data (not passing); Benchmark assessment data (not meeting  standard); Term grades (not passing); IEP goals (not meeting the goals); NYSESLAT levels; and Attendance data (below 70%).  The strategies we use are leveled texts with scaffolded supports; Reading and skill development strategies; Graphic organizers;  Questioning strategies; Achieve3000 used during the day; Speech Teacher Push-In in ELA classes; ICT classes; Fuel Education  self-paced study programs; Independent study class in a lab setting with one-on-one teacher instructional support; and  Literacy class.      Social Studies: For example, ELL students practice scaffolded self and peer-editing processes on DBQ essays to revise their  work and improve their grammar. Criteria for determining targeted support services are entering state assessment levels (level  1 and low 2); Baseline Exams (not meeting standard); Student progress in the subject (not meeting standard); Regents’ data  (not passing); Benchmark assessment data (not meeting standard); Term grades (not passing); IEP goals (not meeting the  goals); NYSESLAT levels (tested not Proficient); and Attendance data (below 70%). The strategies we use are leveled texts with  scaffolded supports; Strategic Learner/Reader strategies; Graphic organizers; Questioning strategies; ICT classes; Fuel  Education self-paced study programs; Independent study class in a lab setting with one-on-one teacher instructional support in  English and selective Spanish support.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Analysis of last year's data reflected significant progress on the NYSESLAT, and that students struggle to pass content area  Regents. To support students' ability to master course content we will maintain our model support in content classes.  The majority of our ENL students have Spanish as a native language, and are not fully literate in Spanish. We are planning  to  increase the Native Language support with the help of our Spanish Teacher, Ms. Russo, in order to enable these students to  build on their assets and graduate bilingual and biliterate.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   At this time we are not discontinuing any specific programs or services for ELLs.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  We recruit ELLs for our extracurricular activities through a multipronged approach including their counselor, their grade team  liaison, and school-wide announcements and posters. These extracurricular activities are crucial to supporting social language  growth, and we strongly encourage ELLs to participate. As a result of this outreach, our ELLs participate in extracurriculars at a  higher rate than population overall. Our ELLs are involved in the Arts classes and Physical Education classes where the subject  is less language dependent but support language use and development. These classes help ELL students of all levels develop  their talents by offering alternative learning experiences. All ELL and ELL-SWDs are programmed for and have access to same  core and elective classes as everyone else. We believe in creating a rich high school learning experience. In addition, we offer a  wide variety of clubs that are open to all students. Clubs are advertised in hall posters and discussed in ENL and content area  classes. Approximately 70% of our ELL students are in after school, weekend and morning clubs. These programs are funded  out of our general budget. We currently have partnerships with many organizations in order to support our students' academic   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      as well as social and emotional well being. Our programs and partnerships have been created understanding the “whole child”  approach in mind and taking into consideration the needs of all the student populations:  •   Social and Emotional Support:    o    Every student meets biweekly (or more often based on need) with a support staff member (Guidance Counselor, Social  Worker, Good Shepherd Advocate Counselor, Attendance Teacher)  o     Active  collaboration with the Bellevue Clinic on our Campus  o     Peer Mediation  o     Students Against Destructive Decisions- club    o     GSA Club  •   College And Career Readiness:   o     Dedicated College and Career Advisor  o     Collaboration with CollegeBoard   o     College Now -Program  o    AP for All  o     Co-Op Tech -Program  o     iLearn/iZone   o     Mouse Squad  o     National Honor Society  o     Cent’s Ability   o     NASA  •   Mentoring/Student Leadership building:  o     Big Brothers and Big Sisters  (Weil, Gotshal & Manges)   o    Chris Canty Foundation  o     NYC Mentoring   o     Student Government in collaboration with PENCIL  •   Hands On Learning Experiences/Individualized Tutoring:   o     STARS (includes tutoring, Regents’ and SAT preparation)  o     American Museum of Natural Arts   o     Green Team  o     Street Soldiers volunteering group  o     Student School Service (students mentor younger classmen and volunteer in the classrooms as one on one support for  peers)  o     Paw Print Newspaper  o     Yearbook  •   Creative Outlets:  o    Visual Arts Club  o     BEATS poetry and music club  o     After school piano classes by Piano School of New York  o     Student Activities Club (COSA)  •   Physical Activity:  o     Boys’ and Girls’ Bowling; Boys’ Basketball/JV; Girls’ Basketball; Boys’ Baseball - Varsity/JV; Girls’ Softball – Varsity; Boys’  Volleyball – Varsity; Girls’  Volleyball – Varsity;   o     After School Sports Club and Soccer        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  To support our ELLs, the school provides alternate texts in English and Social Studies. Alternate textbooks are available for  Social Studies, with grade appropriate language, providing better accessibility for our ELL students. The ELA classes have  classroom libraries with a variety of genres, and we will get more books in the native languages, spoken by our ELL  populations. Bilingual dictionaries are available. We incorporate technology into the curriculum (Achieve 3000, Apex) as a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68      blended learning learning environment that combines face to face instruction with online curriculum. The majority of our  curriculum is teacher-created and aligned to Common Core Learning Standards. We have regular common-planning time in  which all curriculum is co-planned by content teachers, special education teachers and ENL specialists. Students have access to  bilingual dictionaries.          13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is provided by staff members who speak the language, a buddy system, translations, translated  materials, dictionaries, glossaries and on-line translation programs. Bilingual dictionaries are available, as in on-line translation  software.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The required support and resources correspond to the ages and grade levels of our ELLs who are 9 - 12 graders. All materials  used are age and grade appropriate. Our ELLs are all in Regents level content area classes that are not remedial classes. The  ENL classes support English language acquisition at the level required to prepare for and pass the NYSESLAT exam and NYS  Regents Exams. Teachers have acquired classroom libraries of high-interest, age-appropriate texts at a variety of reading  levels. We plan interdisciplinary and content-specific lessons and projects that incorporate choice and are relevant to our  students' interest. This year, our ENL certified provider will be programmed to provide specific Integrated ENL support in  content area classes based upon grade level when applicable.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    To support our ELLs, the school provides alternate texts in English and Social Studies. Alternate textbooks are available for  Social Studies, with grade appropriate language, providing better accessibility for our ELL students. The ELA classes have  classroom libraries with a variety of genres, and we will get more books in the native languages, spoken by our ELL  populations. Bilingual dictionaries are available. We incorporate technology into the curriculum (Achieve 3000, Apex) as a  blended learning learning environment that combines face to face instruction with online curriculum. The majority of our  curriculum is teacher-created and aligned to Common Core Learning Standards. We have regular common-planning time in  which all curriculum is co-planned by content teachers, special education teachers and ENL specialists. Students have access to  bilingual dictionaries.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Over the summer, we offer an orientation to new students with teachers, administration and older students. When new  students arrive during the year, they are connected with a counselor who supports their transition to the school. They are also  matched with a student mentor from the National Honors Society. In addition, our Grade Teams have Ambassadors whose job  is to provide a forum for students to act as leaders for their peers. Ambassadors model positive academic and behavioral  performance and have students from all groups, including ELLs.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    The main language elective is Spanish. We will take into consideration if a student has a strong interest in another language  elective and is interested in completing a blended learning course via Apex. The languages choices are: Spanish, French,  German, Latin and Chinese.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)?

Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  We are committed to serving all the needs of the ELLs and will do so by making all faculty aware of their needs, by   drawing on the expertise of our ENL Coordinator, High Schools That Work, and the NYC DOE. We have all staff development  time every Monday from 2:20 to 3:40, and every Tuesday from 2:20 to 3:35. HSTW continues its work with teachers in all  content areas to differentiate instruction for all learners while maintaining content rigor. Staff members are encouraged to  participate in NYCDOE PD that they feel will support them in the work they do. We consider all the staff members teachers of  ELL students and therefore expect everyone to be cognisant of ELL and differentiation strategies. Our ENL teacher will attend  professional development for ELL learners and will turnkey this training to the staff. This can be done during our Monday or  Tuesday PD time or during daily common planning period.  Our guidance counselors and administration participate in these  staff-wide PDs, as well as in common planning time with grade teams to collaborate around ELL student learning. In addition,  we have weekly guidance meetings, which include training on working with ELLs from a guidance perspective. All staff,  including secretary (Latesha Scott), parent coordinator (Maria Maldonado), will be provided with at least 15% of ELL Specific  Professional Development time. Our ENL Certified teacher will attend 50% of his Professional Development time for ELL  Specific Training.        In order to engage ELL students in the CCLS, we support teachers in active participation and learning techniques. Our PD  focuses on teaching our teachers how to facilitate the learning process rather than disseminate the information and how to  make their content literacy expertise visible to all. The goal is to create carefully structured situations during the lesson that  allow students to solve problems independently and encourage students to draw on their abilities to discover answers by  themselves rather than rely on adults to supply the facts. With the support of the MBFC, we will explore different ENL  Professional Development.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As ELLs transition from level to level they still need to be supported to meet requirements for graduation. In order to  accomplish this, our teachers need to learn focused ENL strategies, not just from staff members but also in collaboration with,  our administrator and outside consultants such as PENCIL and HSTW. Our goal is to have our ELL students graduate with their  cohort, within four years, and have a strong post secondary plan in place after they graduate. We support these ELLs in college  and career readiness through our Integrated ENL classes, Career Choices Advisory Program, which uses a college and career  curriculum provided by the guidance counselor, Varinia Rodriguez and the support staff. Every student meets with their  advisor weekly to discuss social emotional and academic topics.        We believe that all teachers should be trained in ENL strategies and on differentiating instruction, especially since most  classrooms are composed of students with varying levels of English proficiency and subject area expertise.   A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 80  will be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating  language and content instruction for English language learners. For all ENL teachers, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the  required professional development hours will be dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area  instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for  English language learners. the professional development will be provided by High Schools That Work organization. In addition,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70         we will use NYCDOE and online resources to supplement our PD.  The records of the professional development will be kept at  the PD binder.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our ENL Coordinator meets with parents and the student to discuss goals of the program, language development progress,  language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas every cycle. The content area  teachers meet with the parents four times a school year to discuss content area needs and progress. The counselor meets with  the student weekly and is in contact with the family at least once every cycle. If we do not have a translator on staff, we will  use the NYC DOE translation services. All the meeting notes are recorded in Jumprope. In addition, the school counselors have  their own confidential notes.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   We have a Parent Teacher Association and a School Leadership Team. We believe in active parent involvement which will be  encouraged continuously through newsletters, phone calls, emails, and family evenings. We organize activities based on the  parental feedback and needs surveys. The school offers an information session on June, and an orientation in August. We plan  to survey ELL parents to see what their needs are, and encourage our ELL parents to join our PTA. We partner with community  organizations and our Attendance Teacher/Family Relations coordinator, Maria Maldonado, is actively involved in these  outreach efforts. We invite parents to school assemblies, open houses, orientation and open school nights. We have staff  members who can translate Spanish for parents and we make arrangements with DOE Translation and Interpretation unit  when needed.    In accordance with Part 154.2, Daniel Geick will be holding yearly meetings with each parent and student to discuss their ENL  goals, and progress.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Anita Manninen-Felix, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Murray Hill Academy                                                                              School DBN: 02M432  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      In June, we will conduct a survey during Student and Parent Orientation for the incoming 9 th graders, and  examine the home language data in ATS. On ATS, the RAPL report will give us a list of students and their parents  and the spoken and written native languages. The RHLA report lists the home languages broken down by grade  level and home language.This report will be updated one time per cycle.       In addition, we will use cumulative student records to determine what languages we need to translate documents  into. To officially transfer and register into our school, students are required to bring a transcript and their   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74      parent/guardian. They fill out the Home Identification Language Survey, emergency contact cards, speak with the  assistant principal or Principal, as well as guidance counselors, and attendance teacher. This process gives us an  indication of what their home language is, and the best way to communicate with them. When parents fill out the  blue emergency cards, we ask families to give us the name and phone number of a contact person who speaks  and understands English, in a case of an emergency and/or if the parent cannot understand spoken English.    For new transfer students, we ask students to bring a transcript and their parent/guardian during a conversation  with a staff member before being registered and starting classes. They fill out the Home Identification Language  Survey, emergency contact cards, and speak with a school administrator, guidance counselor, social worker,  and/or grade team leader. This process gives us an indication of what their home language is, and the best way to  communicate with them. We have bilingual Spanish speaking teachers (Ms. Russo, Ms. Maldonado, Ms. Parra  Innocent) as well as a school administrator (Mr. Islam) who speaks Bengaly for our top 2 non-English speaking  languages spoken at MHA.       Our Parent Contact, Guidance Counselor, Student Advocates and Social Workers will be actively in touch with  families, via formal and informal conversations. We will ascertain which parents require translators for future  meetings and interviews. This will also help us to have school documents and notices translated into the  appropriate languages.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      At MHA, we continuously work to foster and maintain a positive school culture in which all students and families feel  welcomed into our school community, regardless of home language. We believe this is critical to engaging families  into our school community and fostering a safe learning environment for all in order to ensure the success of all of our  students. Our school’s safety plan reflects this by containing procedures to ensure that parents in need of language  access services feel welcome into our school community and have equitable access to our school’s administrative  offices, regardless of any language barriers.

The  school and student information will be disseminated via automated phone messenger service, emails, and written  notifications. These mailings include all the NYC DOE mandated letters and forms for parent notifications. We will  translate different parent notifications including Welcome Back to School, Attendance, Title 1, academic programs,  NCLB information, activities and college and career readiness, including tutoring, graduation requirements, etc. We  will translate written information to parents about students’ progress and achievement. The parents will receive a  translated Bill of Parents Rights and Responsibilities and Student Code of Conduct. We will reach-out to the NYC DOE  Translation and Interpretation unit for translation support with languages that our staff cannot translate.  Our staff will be informed during case conferencing, IEP training, common planning time meetings, in the MHA Staff  Manual and during morning roll calls that there are translation services available if the staff member needs to  communicate with non-English speaking parents in order to reach all families. We will also inform staff that minor  students are not to act as translators, per Chancellor's regulation A-663. We will inform parents who attend PTA  meetings that translation services are available for those meetings. Documents will be submitted to the Translation  Office two weeks in advance in order to get optimal parental involvement. Staff is also made aware that Google  Translate is a resource readily available to communicate with parents in writing or in person.     Our staff will use Professional Development Time to go over the Chancellor's Regulation and discuss resources readily  available for staff.     Anyone requiring language assistance services will receive a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      All materials will be translated into the appropriate languages for parents. At Parent Teacher Conferences, both at  school and through phone calls, we will provide, where possible, the necessary translation for parents. These services,  both written and oral translation, will be provided by school staff members, where applicable, and DOE Translation  Services. We will have appropriate school signage and forms in languages other than English. These are posted in the  main office, Attendance Teacher office, and around the school with DOE provided posters. All brochures, flyers, and  letters that go out to parents that are not translated into languages deemed necessary at the beginning of the year  include a flyer that describes how to get information translated.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79         Every PTA meeting has the LAC in attendance and all Parent Teacher Conferences have a welcome table with a social  worker, bilingual guidance counselor, and staff member who is instructed to ensure every family member who arrives  receives translation services by staff.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We will have a parent survey to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services. It will be  available for parents after they have visited our school for any reason. We also ask parents/guardians in person during  parent teacher conferences and during outreach when possible. We will utilize this feedback to improve how we  refine our language services. We document our outreach on JumpRope.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80
