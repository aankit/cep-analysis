This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of PS 52 is to foster independent learning for all of our students by recognizing and celebrating their  differences. As independent life-long learners we will excel academically through differentiated instruction while  maintaining academic rigor to support individual needs and maximize student potential.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.S. 52 has a citywide gifted and talented program on every grade. We also have an integrated co-teaching (ICT) class  on every grade to meet the needs of our students with Individualized Educational Plans (IEP). We offer music, art,  technology/STEM, dance, science lab, library and physical education. Our Visual Arts program provides the students  with an opportunity to learn about artists and their styles and create projects in a similar style. We highlight the  students learning in the Arts throughout the school year with several celebrations and festivities. We have a full time  Music teacher who directs our 3rd, 4th and 5th grade chorus. We have also have a 3rd and 4th grade string orchestra  with both a violin and cello program. We have a resident cellist from Carnegie Hall and recently received the VHI Save  the Music grant to purchase more instruments.   Through funding from our councilman we offer a dance program and a stop motion animation arts program after  school for grades 3, 4 and 5. These participating students present a culminating performance at the end of the  program. Our English Language Learners participate in an after-school program to provide enrichment opportunities  for these students to acquire proficiency in the English language. They participate in activities that promote and  develop the students’ reading, writing, listening and speaking skills. We also received STEM grant through Brooklyn  Borough Presidents office to create STEM learning labs and infuse technology into all classrooms. Our goal is to  provide every student with access to their own I-pad and Laptop to use throughout the curriculum and integrate  technology effectively in all areas of the curriculum. To look to develop partnerships with STEM programs and create  enrichment programs that embed coding, engineering and robotics into instruction.    We have an annual talent show which affords the students an opportunity to highlight their talents and have the  experience of performing on stage for an audience. This year we have received a Midori grant to begin violin and cello  instruction before and after school. Additionally, our Arts Department has worked on collaborative projects such as  Disney's Musical Kids, Arts festivals and holiday shows.   P.S. 52 participate in many community outreach programs. We raise awareness and funding for American Heart  Association, American Diabetes foundation and St. Jude’s children’s hospital. This year we raised almost 3,000 dollars  for the American Diabetes foundation. We also received a Teaching Garden from the American Heart association and  our 4th grade students have been working with the physical education department to plant and care for the garden.    We offer an adult English class for parents that are not fluent in English. This class is held three times a week. We also  offer an adult nutrition class funded by the Food Bank of New York. This class is held once a month for parents to  learn about nutrition and to be aware of what their children are learning.   Through our Title I funding we offer many family nights to bring the parents and their children together for activities  full of learning and fun. Some of these nights include the international food festival, family game night, family sports  night, pajama read aloud, kindergarten fair, Valentine's Day Craft night, Male Mentor Night and parent informational  meetings, parent learning workshops, and many more.   We have created collaborative relationships with the community. We have established a strong partnership with our  feeder school MS 14, provided support to our local shelter families and community center and continue to host The  Kings Bay Y after school program at the school site. One of these programs is the Basketball Skills program. The  basketball coach and mentor students come over from MS14 once a week to run drills and pick-up games with our  4th and 5th grade students. We have worked along-side our local politicians to ensure strong family and community  ties. This year, parents will be participating in co-leading professional development for other parents.       This year, we have 4 full time pre-kindergarten classes to strengthen our early childhood literacy. As part of the  program for the 2018-2019 school year, the school has continued to use an RTI team which includes, one literacy  coach and STAR Universal Screening Tool for grades 1-5 as a baseline. The baseline will be used to determine  intervention services for students in 1st grade through fifth grade. We are implementing the MaxScholar reading   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      program to provide additional intervention with an Orton Gillingham based reading program. We will continue to  develop and enhance our literacy curriculum by receiving support and materials from Teachers College Reading and  Writing project and initiating their phonics units this year.       We have also implemented a Character Education Program that promotes model citizens and currently working on  using Sanford Harmony school-wide as a Character Education Program. We encourage our students to monitor and  take on leadership roles throughout the community. We have created a committee that meets as needed to partner  with families to improve student behavior. We are beginning our day this year with a morning meeting in each  classroom to check in with students and ensure they are ready to learn. Throughout the year we will be bringing in  social justice circles, expanding our morning meetings and incorporating more culturally responsive curriculum to  ensure we meet the needs of all of our students.    P.S. 52 continue to make great strides. We have improved our parent-teacher relationship as evidenced by the  learning environment survey, and exit slips from parent meeting and workshops. Teachers are working collaboratively  to develop units of study aligned to CCLS horizontally and vertically. Despite many changes in curriculum, leadership  and procedures the students are consistently making improvements academically and teachers are developing their  practice as evidenced in their observations.   At P.S. 52 we have consistently seen teachers develop higher order thinking questions, continuing to engage their  students in a constructivist approach while maintaining academic rigor and providing each other in a supportive  environment where they are willing to learn from each other and teachers in other schools within the district and  neighboring districts. We will further this work by continuing our partnership with Metamorphosis math professional  development and by beginning our enrollment in the Algebra for All initiative. We have partnered with Teachers  College Reading and Writing Project to enhance our literacy instruction through professional development. We hired  a full time literacy coach that was a previous TC staff developer. She will collaborate with two full time staff  developers to support the work in literacy throughout the school day. All teachers will attend institutes, speciality  groups and conference days that will support their curriculum and pedagogy.                   3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We are focusing on our growing number of English Language Learners (237 students) and students with special needs  including students with IEP’s. We are working towards creating an environment that fosters learning for all  populations while building capacity in the classroom to help teachers develop strategies to support our school  community as a whole and differentiate the instruction to meet the needs of all learners and maximize student  growth for all subgroups.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   As we continue to monitor our strengths and areas of improvement, we have decided to focus on assessment and  using data accurately to provide entry and access to all students in literacy.

The team also looks at ELA and math programs and the assessments embedded in the  programs. PS 52 also has vertical teams in Math, ELA, Science, Social Studies and the ARTS that look assessments.  Staff and administration meet together to plan professional development in the area of assessment. PS 52 has also  been chosen to be of an RTI program to develop a universal screening tool for the school. The RTI team includes  school principal, AP and two teachers        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       PS 52 Parent Involvement Policy    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S 52 Sheepshead Bay, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input.

By closely  analyzing and examining, NYSESLAT data from the 2017-2018 school year, that our 2nd-5th  grade ENL students need support in the modality of writing and speaking. Most of our students  fall within the transitioning and expanding range. Of the 177 students who took the  NYSESLAT in the spring, 15 students scored within the commanding range. We would like to  increase this number and are therefore planning an after school program to target students in all  language proficiency levels, specifically in the modalities of writing and speaking. Students will  be placed into classes based on their ENL proficiency level and  provided targeted, culturally  responsive instruction will be provided according to the modalities in which they require more  support. The program is designed to help our children as learners of a new language using  interactive games, read alouds and whole group conversation with sentence frames and language  prompts, hands on art projects, cooking, Readers Theater and Teachers College Supports for  English Language Learners in the Units of Study .   Four ENL certified teachers will provide  instruction alongside 3 general/special education teachers.  Materials needed: games, high  interest read alouds, Teachers College curriculum and ELL supports, cooking, art materials, and  Readers Theater supplies.    We have chosen to provide an after-school program because research shows that students  participating in after-school programs show an increase in positive attitudes and behaviors linked  to success in school and improves academic achievement especially for  struggling ELLs (McLaughlin, 2002; Miller, 2003, Hall, et. al, 2004).        Based on students' current writing samples, periodic assessments and achievement on the  2018 NYSESLAT we have determined that our ELLs would benefit from participating in an  after-school program that would target their speaking and writing needs and help to improve  their achievement on the NYSESLAT.  This program will be offered to all ELL students  (entering, emerging, transitioning, and expanding) in grades 2-5 including long-term ELLs and  newcomers.    The after-school program will run from  to January 9, 2019-April 18, 2019 on Wednesdays and  Thursdays from 2:30pm - 4:00pm using a co-teaching model to support students through  experiential learning, conversation, vocabulary building and hands on activities. From March 01  ,2019 to April 18, 2019 our students will be supported in preparing for  the  NYSESLAT assesment. Students will be provided with a snack at no cost to Title III.   We  chose to have a small class size for our Title III program to offer students the opportunity for a  more individualized experience in a non-threatening atmosphere and to improve student  achievement.    The program will have 7 teachers.  Four of the teachers are certified in ESL.   This program will  include mathematical vocabulary and another program for NYSESLAT preparation.  The classes  will be taught in English.  An administrator (Ms. Harding/Ms. Geller) will be available to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   supervise and assist in administrating the program. This is the only program that is running on  Wednesdays/Thursdays at the specified time so Ms. Harding/Ms. Geller will need to be  compensated through Title III funds.    Parents will be notified in the parents preferred language about the program and the  expectations.  In order to determine effectiveness of the program, we will monitor attendance  daily and provide pre and post assessments to determine student progress.     The materials that will be purchased and used for the Title III program are:  "Getting Ready for  the NYSESLAT" from Attanasio & Associates, Inc., Readers Theater, cooking supplies and  general supplies such as chart paper, pencils, folders and cd players to practice the listening  portion of the NYSESLAT.    During the Tuesday parent time, parents of ELL students will be invited for a homework help  time for parents to support student understanding.  A variety of paraprofessionals, general  education and ESL teachers will participate to help parents with the continued language barriers  from October 2018 - May 2019 from 2:30pm - 3:35PM.     The goal of the direct instruction supplemental programs are to increase academic achievement,  develop academic language, and improve English literacy skills for our English Language  Learners in grades 2-5.     Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:                The rationale for the professional development plan is to provide ongoing high-quality and  rigorous opportunities for our ENL teachers as well as other staff responsible for delivery of  instruction and services to ELLs which will enhance our school-wide professional development  plan.     The seven Title III teachers will receive professional development training throughout the year.  Our school-wide professional development plan includes vertical planning, inquiry teams, grade  planning and professional book clubs.       During this time, teachers will discuss how to enrich vocabulary instruction, create teacher made  materials appropriate for their ELL population (grade and proficiency level), look at student  work, analyze data and share their experiences in implementing the robust vocabulary strategies  in their classroom.  Teachers will share their reflections on the strengths of these lessons and  review student work to show evidence of student growth.  Providing the general education  population of teachers with strategies for ENL students will reduce the amount of downtime that  ELL students will have since the teachers will be using strategies that work.  In addition, teachers  will be provided with specific needs for students based on NYSESLAT scores and the modalities  in which students need to improve on.  Therefore, students will have targeted instruction in a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         Part C: Professional Development   subject area with specifics to individual student needs.  For example, If a student struggles with  speaking and listening; and a teacher is teaching Westward Expansion, the student might be  assigned work around westward expansion using speaking and listening strategies to support  student growth in the particular modality.      In addition  ENL teachers receive weekly emails from the Office of English Language Learners  with professional development opportunities and workshop information that teachers are  encouraged to attend based on what they feel will best meet the needs of their students.  In  addition, Professional Development is being offered from by the BFSC on a various topics  related to ELL - dates to be announced. Our certified ESL teachers meet weekly to collaborate  and share ideas on best practices, student achievement, and make plans to address the needs of  our ELLs-based on data, teacher feedback, conferences, and kid-watching.    ENL teachers will be providing monthly professional development on ENL strategies with  agendas and attendance during the Monday Professional Development time.  The cost for the  ENL after school program  will be approximately $10,000 for the cost of teacher per session and  supervisory per session.  In addition, the materials will cost approximately $3,000 for the  NYSESLAT preparation books.  For the NYSESLAT support, the cost will be approximately  $10,000 for the cost of the teacher per session and supervisory per session.  The cost of the  Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT books will cost approximately $5,000.     Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as  parent orientation during ELL identification process.     rationale       schedule and duration      name of provider    how parents will be notified of these activities   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             Our rationale for parental involvement is that we want the parents of our ELLs to feel welcomed,  valued, and most importantly involved in their child’s education.  We offer many opportunities  for parental engagement with activities that include parents of ELLs with the assistance of  bilingual staff to help translate in the parent's native language.  All documentation is kept in a  binder with agendas and attendance sheets with the parent coordinator.  All staff members and  parents have access.       The parental involvement component that will specifically coincide with our Tile III program  will be two ELL Family Nights where families are invited into the school to participate in  activities that will encourage the development of the English language in a fun, welcoming way.  ELL parents and their children will be invited to participate in several enrichment activities while  rotating through various stations. This year we hope to offer prizes to the top three ELL parents  who attend the most parent involvement activities/events.  The lucky winners will be recognized  at our Title III ELL Family Night.  The top prize will be a brand new Apple I Pad mini!   The  two ELL Family Nights events will facilitated by the seven teachers working the Title III  program, and the Assistant Principals, Ms. Harding and Ms. Geller. The ELL Family Night  events will be held on January 24, 2019 from 5:00-7:00 pm and on April 17, 2019 from 5:00- 7:00 pm.  In addition, the school’s Parent Coordinator, Ms. Warner, will be on hand to assist as   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    well as bilingual translators who can help in translating information into the parent’s native  language.      All information that is distributed to the parents of ELLs is translated into as many languages as  possible, and translation services are provided whenever needed at all of our school events to  meet the parents preferred language survey.      In addition to our Title III program, parent workshops to help students achieve in all academic  areas are offered throughout the year. Learning Strategies Part I was presented by our principal,  Ms. Hurley. Informative curricula meetings in ELA, Math, and Science, Special  Education, Promotional Criteria, JHS informational night, and Kindergarten Orientation are a  few ways that we help parents stay informed of the standards and high expectations that we  expect from all our students.    Enrichment programs and extracurricular activities such as: music  concerts, Science Fair, Art Fair, Kindergarten Fair, Transition from Pre-K to Kindergarten parent  workshop,  Family Sports Night, Pajama Read Aloud, International Family Night and Career  Day spotlight the hard work of our students and are shared with parents both during school and  at night to accommodate all families.  As a school we hold two evening fundraisers that have  brought the school community together. Many families attend and look forward to joining the  school community and supporting their child’s school. Through our Halloween and Valentine's  Day parties we have increased parent involvement and have raised funds to purchase extra  materials and programs.  By providing translation services during these activities, it allows  parents to feel welcomed and a part of our school community.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The assessment tool that our school uses to measure outcomes for student learning in Grades K-2  is Fountas and Pinnell.In  kindergarten, the assessment is given in September, November, January, March, and June.  •     Grades 3-5 students measures  of student learning in math and reading are assessed using Performance Series-Scantron. All students were assessed using the  Gates MacGinitie assessment  ELA, Math and NYSESLAT scores are analyzed including the item analysis for each of the state  assessment This information helps inform our school’s instructional plan in several ways.  •     The data is carefully analyzed by  the data team and the teacher teams as well as the leadership team, and instructional cabinet.   •     This information is shared  with school wide during professional development.   •     Then the leadership team looks at the areas where the students are  performing below standard and provide additional supports.  •     This data informs the teachers (both classroom and ENL)  what skills the student has when s/he comes into their class.  •     Teachers use this information to group students  and drive  instruction.    and ENL teachers to move instruction•     Our Title III program is offered to all our ELLs and former ELLs.  The data  collected enables us to provide intensive instruction and remediation by grouping our struggling ELL's that are not reading and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      writing on grade level and continuing to support our former ELLs in the transitional process.   This school year we were able to provided after school support for our Ell's for 8 weeks. Students were placed in small groups  to support ELA skills and behaviors.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?     There are a few ways that we evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs.    •   We look at the data from many sources: NYSESLAT, results of the NYS ELA, Math, and Science assessments, conference  notes, checklists, student work with rubrics, Fountas and Pinnell assessments, baseline and benchmark Unit assessments,  and Scantron and performance tasks.    •   Although the state report card is not out yet, we can look at the RLAT, and we can see how many students have made  progress.  We flagged students that have not made one level of progress or regressed a level and provided them with extra  support.   •   When the state report card is released, we analyze the data to determine if we are meeting Annual Yearly Progress for ELL  students. In the meantime, we use the data from the RLAT to determine student progress.  •   We analyze the data to reveal which students are not meeting or not making progress.   Factors that we consider include  but are not limited to: student’s home language, length of time in country, gaps in educational services (movement from DOE  school to home country and back) SIFE status, attendance and socio-economic status. Based on our data, we provide support  to students in school as well as their families.  •   We also look at Mid-year progress reports that our school designed and sends home to parents in January.    •   Data spreadsheets are collected various times through out the academic year. the spreadsheets contain current reading  levels and conference notes that show us how much progress our ELLs are making.   •   This broad range of assessment tools offer a wealth of information to help us determine how our ELLs are progressing.    •   We compare this data with data from general education students to see if there are any achievement gaps.   •   We then make a plan and discuss students’ strengths and weaknesses during common preps, grade meetings, and inquiry  time.             3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Performance series gives an accurate portrait of each student's instructional level over a wide breadth of knowledge in  ELA and mathematics. This enables teachers to track individual students and class progress. Administration is able to monitor  grade level and school progress over time. Teachers can compare performance scores through the Scaled Score, Standards  Item Pool Score, National Percentile Ranking. In addition, teachers can also develop custom learning plans for each student  with just a few clicks, based on State, Common Core, and College & Career Readiness standards.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The instructional cabinet works as a team to gather all the grade level data. We sort all data and analyze the progress of sub- groups, including Ell's, so the team is able to monitor the progress of all students. Students falling bellow grade level standards  receive appropriate support according to the Tiers of RTI.Teachers all use the data to form Tier 1 in classroom support.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   PS 52 is part of the citywide AIS project in partnership with AIR, as a result of the two year project for the 2016-2017 school  year, the our school is implementing a universal screening tool to determine AIS needs bases on the pillars of literacy. The  school has also developed an AIS team of teachers and paraprofessionals to deliver targeted AIS services based on the needs  of the students. The ELL students are included in the intervention plan. The AIS team will work closely with the ENL providers  to meet the needs of the students. The data provided from assessments in the classroom informs us of the current  performance of ELLs as well as their progress in reading and literacy skills.  When the data indicates that our current ELLs are  scoring at a significantly lower level on the assessments than our non-ELLs, a committee consisting of the principal, assistant  principal/special education supervisor, the school psychologist, the school social worker, occupational therapist, physical  therapist, speech providers, ENL teachers, SAPIS counselor, guidance counselor, AIS/SETSS/IEP teacher, and classroom   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      teachers meets to discuss ways to intervene.  The results from assessments are also used to assess the need for Tier Two and  Tier Three interventions.   •     Tier 1 Intervention in the classroom- small group, peer tutoring, guided reading groups targeted  computer programs.  Teachers use classroom assessment to determine academic areas in need for intervention. •     Tier 2-  Intervention in addition to the classroom intervention- extended day program for students in grades 3-5, additional instruction  twice a week for fifty minutes each day in groups of four to six students. Students are services in small groups of four to six  students with assigned extended day teachers. In grades K-2, additional instruction is provided by AIS teachers and ESL  teachers during the day.  State test scores, local assessments and classroom assessments are used to determine student needs  of tier 2 interventions. Programs include Wilson, Fundations, Targeted Guided Reading and Great Leaps Math program are  used.•     Tier 3- Intervention after limited success of Tier 1 and Tier 2 interventions. Students receive targeted instruction in a  small group of (1 to 3) students.•     In order for students to move from Tier 1 to Tier2 and above, teachers must present the  students to the School Implementation Team. •     PS 52 has Arabic, Russian and Spanish speaking staff including teachers and  paraprofessionals that assist in determining the need of services for students. •     All students including ELLs must complete  Tier 1 through Tier 3 services before moving to the special education services.  •     ELL Students that are referred for special  education services are evaluated in their native language.                 6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    The school uses the tools to measure growth for our ELL students. We are currently in good standing in all groups and sub  groups including our ENL students. We carefully measure the progress of our ELL students and the sub groups based on their  language group, ethnic group and economic status. We are currently at 100% on all areas in our Ell Data report. We use that  report to make sure we are in compliance with all ELL mandates.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Administrators, ENL teachers, and classroom teachers all continuously monitor student progress using data.  This includes  periodic cumulative assessments of content and language skills, but also assessments using sample questions from Engage NY  based on student needs by modality as indicated by NYSESLAT score quarterly. The results are analyzed bv the ENL teachers  and shared with classroom teachers to drive instruction.   Additional assessments of student progress are F&P, NYS scores,  performance assessments, conference notes, and teacher observations.    •     ENL staff form close relationships with our students and their families because we believe that "it takes a village to raise a  child."  Working closely with families helps us to form partnerships with all stake holders in a way that maximizes participation  and accountability for all involved.  Our students greatly benefit from this collaboration because they know their education  does not stop at the end of the school day.  •     Schedules are arranged in such a way that ENL teachers share preps with classroom teachers.  This is done so all  pedagogues serving ENL teachers can meet to plan together.  Administrators are kept aware of the planning through email and  when they attend grade conferences, inquiry time and common preps. Teachers support and learn from each other by sharing  best practices, turn keying new information learned at conferences, workshops, and professional development opportunities,  and providing suggestions and feedback to teachers on instructional strategies to best meet the needs of ELLs.  We do this to  support language proficiency without sacrificing content instruction.  •     All our staff is supportive and responsible to enrich  the language development of our students.  From administration, teachers, paraprofessionals, school aides, to supporting staff  and out of classroom personnel, the entire school models correct communication skills throughout the school day.  •     ENL  staff attend professional development and turn key new information to classroom teachers.  This year, ENL teachers have been  part of the District Charter Collective, an effort by the chancellor to build collaboration between district and charter schools in  New York City for developing and sharing best practices to service ENL students.  ENL teachers in our school are currently  developing strategies for classroom teachers to work with Entering and Emerging ENL students. •     Every lesson is aligned to  the CCLS.  This is true in all classes: general education, special education, and ESL classes.  The ESL team aligns instruction with  grade level standards and materials while incorporating the NYS ESL standards and performance indicators.  We are also in the  process of evaluating the New Language Arts Progressions (ENL/New Language) and incorporating them into our  curriculum.   •     After all these components were taken into consideration, the administration in conjunction with the ENL  department decided on the providing the following instructional models for our ELLs:           •     Our Freestanding ENL Program is a rigorous, systematic program of English language instruction using second language   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         acquisition methodologies such as: The Natural Approach, providing access to content area instruction through the use of  various instructional supports, e.g., scaffolding (modeling, bridging, contextualization, schema building, graphic organizers,  questioning, text re-presentation, metacognition and working in cooperative groups) the Balanced Literacy model, and  thematic units of study, and sheltered instruction (SIOP) model, which advocates for the use of scaffolding and differentiation  with cultural relevance to help the students gain confidence and momentum in their work.        ENL teachers also support their instruction in English with native language support such as bilingual resources and selective  translation in native language when available.•     Our lessons include both content and ENL language objectives based on New  York State ENL Standards in alignment with the Common Core Learning Standards. •     All ELLs participate in a comprehensive  approach to Balanced Literacy and Math.  The Balanced Literacy components include: Think-Aloud, Read Aloud, Accountable  Talk, Shared Reading/Writing, Guided Reading/Writing, and Independent Reading/Writing.  •     In Math teachers utilize  the Engage NY math  using manipulatives and a workshop model.  ENL teachers collaborate with classroom teachers to isolate  and teach key tier 2 and tier 3 vocabulary to assist ENL students in decoding and comprehending word problems.•     All  classrooms are rich with print and have leveled libraries, which students use during the day and at home.              Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.      All entering and emerging students are provided with 180 minutes of  alone ENL instruction and 180 Minutes of  integrated ENL instruction. Transitioning students are serviced 180 minutes a week, also through a combination of  integrated and standalone services.  The work that the ENL teachers do with these students reinforces the grade level  curriculum.  ENL best practices and strategies are used throughout the instruction to help students have equal access  to the curriculum.  For Expanding students,  ENL teachers provide integrated instruction  180 minutes a  week. In  addition, when servicing Expanding and Commanding students the ENL teacher co-teaches with classroom teachers  for the mandated minutes according to the CR Part 154.  Writing has been determined a target area for this sub-group  based on NYSESLAT and ELA state data. In addition to an overall focus, students are also grouped by their specific  needs modalities based on data from the NYSESLAT.  Thus, each group of students during a lesson practice overall  objectives with those in which they underachieved on last year's NYSESLAT.    Instruction is delivered through a combination of intergrated and stand alone  instruction based on New York State  mandate for each level of ENL proficiency.    Students are heterogeneously grouped in their classes-with a mix  of ELLs, FELLs, and Non-ELLs.  New York State regulations determine how many units of ENL instruction each student  receives according to his or her English proficiency level on the New York State English as a Second Language  Achievement Test.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.                  c.  DL program.  If applicable.              2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54            All entering and emerging students are provided with 180 minutes of  alone ENL instruction and 180 Minutes of  integrated ENL instruction. Transitioning students are serviced 180 minutes a week, also through a combination of  integrated and standalone services.  The work that the ENL teachers do with these students reinforces the grade level  curriculum.  ENL best practices and strategies are used throughout the instruction to help students have equal access to the  curriculum.  For Expanding students,  ENL teachers provide integrated instruction  180 minutes a  week. In addition, when  servicing Expanding and Commanding students the ENL teacher co-teaches with classroom teachers for the mandated  minutes according to the CR Part 154.  Writing has been determined a target area for this sub-group based on NYSESLAT and  ELA state data. In addition, to an overall focus, students are also grouped by their specific needs modalities based on data from  the NYSESLAT.  Thus, each group of students during a lesson practice overall objectives with those in which they  underachieved on last year's NYSESLAT.   We look at the RLAT in August when scores become available and create schedules using the mandated minutes for each  student so that services are provided as of the first day of school.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   ENL students receive English language instruction with native language support in the content areas. This is done in order to  make content more comprehensible and to nurture language development in alignment with Common Core Learning  Standards, units of study and curriculum of their current grade level.•     All teachers are trained to use data assessment to  drive and plan differentiated instruction in ELA and the content areas to meet the needs of their students.  •     Teachers  provide native language support with the following resources: translated versions of assessments, visuals, realia, bilingual  dictionaries, and word for word glossaries.  •     Teachers identify entry points to scaffold instruction with vocabulary support  in order to help students take more ownership of their learning.  ENL teacher plans with classroom teachers in order to embed  ENL mythologies when the ENL teachers are not present classroom. When providing integrated instruction teachers use  various co teaching models. Stand alone instruction is curriculum based to help support ENL success in the classroom with ENL  mythologies.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELLs are evaluated in their native language throughout the year in several ways.   •     Classroom teachers allow students to respond to questions in their native language-both in class discussions and on formal  tests.    •     Classroom libraries contain literature in students’ native languages.   •     Students can give answers orally and the information is translated back into English and they can also write their answers  in their native language and it will be translated.    •     Also, native language exams are given for New York State Math and Science tests when it is helpful to the student.    •     Whenever possible, exams are given in a student's native language, and if no paper exam is available, the student has the  exam translated into his/her native language ensuring that all students are assessed on the content, regardless of their English  proficiency.    •     Word-for-word glossaries are utilized in grades 3-5 to help students make the input comprehensible.  •     A review of the data from two content areas, English Language Arts and Mathematics show that a majority of our ELLs that  have taken standardized tests have not scored as well as native speakers.    •    Uncommon vocabulary, non-literal usage (idioms), complex sentence structures, uncommon genres, and multi-clausal  processing are all barriers that can create a gap between performance of ELLs and non-ELL students.    •     It is that reason why we offer multiple opportunities for students to be assessed on their knowledge of the content being  taught throughout the year.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.   Long Term   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      e.   Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    There are numerous ways we differentiate for our ELLs on a daily basis.  Many factors are taken into consideration when  teachers plan for their ELLs.  Their proficiency level, the amount of time they have been in the country, whether they have had  any interrupted education, and their literary level in their native language all come into play.        A.     Students with Interrupted Formal Education: (according to CR Part 154, SIFE is defined as students who: come from a  home in which a language other than English is spoken and enter a school in the US after grade 2; or are immigrant students  and enter a school in the US after grade 2 and have had at least two years less schooling than their peers; function at least two  years below expected grade level in reading and mathematics; and, may be preliterate in their first language) or in the  scenario where a student returns to his native country and attends school with no English language instruction and then  comes back to our school, attention must be given to address the learning gaps in his/her instruction.  Our instructional plan  for the situation where we have SIFE students is made in conjunction with the parents, ENL staff, the administration, the  classroom teacher(s), AIS teacher, and guidance counselor.    •     SIFE students need intensive special support and assistance.   •     Whenever available, SIFE students are placed in the ICT class to have the benefit of having two teachers and often a  paraprofessional as well to provide extra support.    •     After taking everything into account, one option is to place the student in a lower grade.  This is done on a case by case  basis and with informed parental consent.    •     When placing the student in a lower grade is not an option, instruction will be accommodated by providing an extra period  of ENL daily, as needed, in addition to the mandated unit as per CR Part 154 regulations, providing academic intervention  services from our AIS teacher, providing counseling services by the guidance counselor, attending the extended day program  for small group instruction based on assessed needs, attending after-school reading/math programs to improve literacy and  math skills, attending our ENL Title III after-school program and providing access to computer assisted language learning  programs.    B.     At PS 52 we are constantly differentiating instruction for all our ELL subgroups.    •     Newcomers are students who have recently immigrated and have very limited English language skills.    •     They may be at the Pre-Production stage of Second Language Acquisition and therefore are assessed to measure their  specific entry point.  •     Instruction is modified for newcomers by focusing on building vocabulary, developing listening comprehension, modeling  reading and writing, using visuals, realia, and providing active contextualized engagement activities.   •     A combination of different second language acquisition strategies (The Natural Approach, TPR, scaffolding) are used to  introduce the students to school routines and basic English language skills.   •     At this stage, teachers may utilize the student’s native language to ensure the students’ understanding of content area  subjects while the student is acquiring English.    •     We are fortunate to have available bilingual picture dictionaries on CDs in many of the languages spoken at our school.    •     In addition, newcomers have access to computer assisted language for our ELLs and former ELLs.   •     We also provide a collection of bilingual/native language reading books in the self-contained ENL classrooms and in the  school library that newcomers can check out to read during the reading block or to take home.    •     The amount of time a student stays in this or any stage varies from student to student.  Therefore, a summary of how we  address the needs of newcomers (in our schools for less than three years) at the various stages of second language acquisition  is included here.  •     As students progress in their acquisition of English, they move to the Early Production Stage.         At this stage, beginner students are beginning to put simple sentences together but still have limited comprehension of  English.      The focus of instruction for beginners is vocabulary building.        This is done through:  •      modeling reading and writing through read aloud and think aloud  •     pairing beginners with a  more dominate English speaker who can provide good modeling  •     providing cooperative group activities that beginners can participate in by  performing tasks such as listing, labeling,  categorizing, responding and answering questions  •     supporting shared reading and writing with visuals   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      •     demonstrations  •     participating in shared experiences  •     planning instruction around themes to maximize opportunities for ELLs to acquire language and concepts  •   Iintroducing and developing vocabulary visually by using picture dictionaries and other visual aids  •     encouraging ELLs to use bilingual dictionaries for native language support during reading and writing activities in order to  clarify meaning  •     During Speech Emergence, Intermediate students are able to respond in simple sentences and have greater receptive skills  in comparison to their expressive abilities.       Instruction for Intermediate students will focus on activities that are designed to:  •      develop higher level of language use in the content areas  •     expanding vocabulary  •     clarifying teaching reading comprehension strategies (summarizing, sequencing, inferring, comparing and contrasting,  drawing conclusions, self-questioning, problem solving, relating background knowledge, distinguishing between fact and  opinion, finding the main idea)   •     scaffolding academic language  •     modeling a think aloud   •     verbalizing a confusing point  •     partnering ELLs with more English dominate speakers that can provide good modeling  •     The writing process is broken down into stages:      This process always starts with brainstorming activities that are visually displayed via graphic organizers.        Grammar, spelling and punctuation rules are taught, as well as, the format for writing essays, reports, poetry and letters.       Teachers confer with students to identify strengths and weaknesses.  These conferences provide new teaching points for  new mini-lessons based on students’ needs.        Small group strategy lessons are conducted for students who exhibit similar strengths and weaknesses.       Teachers encourage students to develop their writing skills in their native language so they can transfer these skills when  they are writing in English.        After students have revised and edited their writing pieces they celebrate their work through a publishing celebration.     •     During Intermediate Fluency, the fourth stage in second language acquisition, advanced students demonstrate greater  control of the English language and produce complex sentences expected of a native speaker.        Although these students are much more fluent they still need support in reading and writing.        The focus of instruction for Advanced students includes:   •     using scaffolding activities during pre-reading and post reading activities  •     teaching reading and writing through purposeful activities rich in context and built on shared experiences through  thematic units of study  •     providing learning activities that can be accomplished by forming small groups in a structure that encourages mutual  cooperation     The ENL teacher works closely with classroom teachers to achieve the following goals:  •provide academic content-area instruction in English  •using ENL methodology and instructional strategies  •using native language support to make content comprehensible  •assisting students to achieve the state-designated level of English proficiency for their grade  C.     Students who require services for 4-6 years are formally identified every September when we analyze our data.    •     The assistant principal and ENL teacher along with input from previous and current classroom teachers meet to discuss  each student that falls into this sub-group and how they can be supported best.   •     Various data such as NYSESLAT scores, ELA state assessments, Acuity ITAs and periodic assessments, conference notes, kid  watching and rubrics are all considered and examined to determine why a student has not scored proficient on the NYSESLAT  and therefore are still entitled to ESL services.   •     Students are then grouped into several different categories and a plan is developed to meet the needs of each student.    •     Most of the students in our school who require 4-6 years of ESL instruction fall into four categories:   o     LEP students with disabilities whose IEP recommends ESL or bilingual instruction   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      o     LEP students held over in grade  o     LEP students who have not met the performance standard in reading  o     LEP students who have not met the performance standard in writing.    •     When an ENL student has been enrolled in an English Language School System for more than two years, they no longer  have promotional criteria based on their ELL status and therefore can be held over if they do not meet grade level standards.    •     For students who are identified as needing extension of services (4-6 years) because they did not meet the performance  standard because they are held over s/he begins receiving Academic Intervention Services (AIS) by one of the specially trained  AIS teachers in addition to the instruction they receive from a certified ENL teacher.    •     These teachers work collaboratively to meet the needs of the held over LEP student based on data from NYSESLAT exams,  item analysis from state assessments, Periodic Assessments, Fountas and Pinnell assessments, and AIS assessments.    •     These students are discussed at monthly School Implementation Team meetings to ensure progress is being made in  Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking.     •     Classroom teachers and ENL teachers work with students individually and in small groups using a variety of researched  based programs while incorporating ENL methodologies.    •     Programs that are used could include but are not limited to: Wilson Reading System, Fundations, Just Words, Options,  Great Leaps Reading, Fountas and Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention, Houghton Mifflin Leveled Readers, Think Alongs,  ReadyGen, Great Leaps Math, Reading Streets, Time for Kids, REACH by National Geographic, Benchmark, and Primary  Phonics.    •     Computer programs are also used to help students work towards grade level expectations.  These programs include  AWARD reading, Aerobics, and Lexia.    •     These students receive this additional instruction and support during the school day and during extended day from their  certified classroom teacher, ENL teacher, and AIS teacher.    •     For the students who fall into the sub-group of not meeting the standard in reading both the classroom teachers and ENL  teachers work collaboratively to improve reading comprehension, fluency, accuracy, and decoding skills by using the workshop  model as a foundation of all reading instruction.    •     Students are grouped according to their reading level (as measured by Fountas and Pinnell) and according to the skill they  are working on.    •     These groups are flexible and constantly changing based upon conferencing, kid watching, and assessing (both formally  with running records and comprehension questions and informally) to make sure the student is working toward the goal set by  the teacher together with the student.   •     During push-in and pull-out classes, ENL and classroom teachers provide differentiated instruction with scaffolding during  whole class, small group, and individual conferences to meet the students’ needs.    •     All teachers incorporate a variety of texts in all genres on all reading levels to help the students grasp the skills and  strategies needed to become a proficient reader.    •     All lessons are aligned to the CCLS to ensure that students have access to grade level texts.    •     Short-term and long-term goals are set for each student with the ENL teacher and classroom teacher.     •     All students participate in reading instruction a minimum of eight hours a week.    •     For those students who do not meet the performance standard in writing, ENL teachers and classroom teachers provide  various rigorous and multiple writing opportunities throughout the day using the workshop model for a foundation of all  writing instruction through shared writing, interactive writing, guided writing, and independent writing.    •     Curriculum maps have been designed by grade level teams with input from the ENL staff that incorporate the CCLS.  •     Teachers confer with students one-on-one and then group students according to specific strategies that need to be  practiced and mastered.    •     Mentor texts are used to introduce the new genre of the unit.    •     Each new writing unit begins with an on-demand writing task and culminates with a writing piece that shows the entire  process.    •     A schedule is developed starting with the publishing date and teachers work backward when planning to ensure each step  of the writing process is taught.    •     Struggling writers are taught to stretch out words, chunk sounds and write what they hear using the Fundations program  during word study and throughout the day from the ENL teacher and classroom teacher.    •     Personalized word walls with visual supports are used to help individualize instruction and assist students with their daily   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      writing.    •     Content and unit specific vocabulary is displayed in alphaboxes to aid in developing academic vocabulary.  •     Students participate in writing instruction a minimum of four periods a week.

E.   Former ELLs are are serviced for a minimum og 90 minutes a week with integrated instruction with a general education m  teacher  certified ENL teacher.    Former ELLs are pulled out for AIS instruction-as needed.  They are placed in general  education classes that are heterogeneously mixed.  We track these students progress to make sure they are not regressing as  studies show can happen and help transition them to independent learners and thinkers.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our school uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least  restrictive environment.    •     We have placed our ELLs with special needs in special education self-contained classes and in Integrated Co-Teaching  classrooms as per their IEP.   •     Our special needs ELLs receive ENL instruction from our licensed ESL pull-out teacher in addition to support services as per  their IEP.    •     This enables us to meet the needs of this specific population by allowing for a majority of instruction to occur in small  groups.    •     Lessons for students with special needs are modified to address different learning styles, incorporating assistance  technology via our Award Reading computer software programs and using a variety of scaffolding techniques.     ENL and special education also work closely to provided instruction.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Students are serviced based on IEP needs not program needs.  Students are mainstreamed and placed in the the least  restrictive environment. All service providers work together to make sure the students receive all services they are entitled  to.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      The targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other content areas are available to students during extended  day.  These AIS groups offer a very low student-teacher ratio.  Students are grouped based on their ELA level, their NYSESLAT  proficiency level, their F &P reading level and several other risk factors.  All ELLs who fall into one of the risk factor categories  are required to attend.  This includes beginners, ELLs with special needs, SIFE, and long-term ELLs. Programs include Wilson,  Foundations, Targeted Guided Reading and Great Leaps Math program.  All intervention programs are taught in English with  native language support.  ELL students will be assessed by the universal screening tool and serviced by the AIS team(AIS  teachers and paraprofessionals targeted instruction in conjunction with the ESL teachers.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We are looking into several new programs to implement with targeted students during our title III program in conjunction with  the AIS team. We are also waiting for state test scores to analyze and plan around.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  We ensure that all ELLs are afforded equal access to all after school programs by having them at times that do not conflict with  other programs.  For example, our Title III program is ran on Wednesdays and Thursday after school for an hour and a  half.  ELLs are invited to participate in after school dance programs by CASA and Community Works.  ELLs are entitled to  extended day programs, AIS, and differentiated instruction throughout the day in both ESL and regular classrooms.  As  enrichment, all ELLs are invited to participate in the annual student-staff kick ball game and the annual school talent show as  well as all school programs that are run at night: Pajama Read Aloud, Halloween Dance and Halloween Night, Family Game  Night, Family Craft Night, Field Days for all  grades Family Movie night and of course, the Title III Program and ELL Family Night  and International Food Night.  This is an opportunity where we celebrate our different cultures and tastes.  ELL families are  encouraged to make traditional food to showcase and share with our school community.  In order to get students college and  career ready we are going to offer after school AP classes in math and test sophistication in the Spring.  In addition, all  ELLs have equal access to the following school clubs: Cello, Violin, Chorus.  Participation in creative endeavors contributes to  language development in all modalities.  We ensure that these programs are not scheduled on any holidays or on the  weekends, when many of our students have other commitments.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  There are many instructional materials that are used to support our ELLs.    •     All classrooms are equipped with computer centers.   •     ELMO projectors are in every classroom.   •      There are class sets of laptops on each floor.   •     All  classrooms have SMART boards or in the process of having smart boards installed.  •     The computer lab is in the process of being updated for the entire school to have access to.      •     Dictionaries and glossaries in student’s native language are used in content area instruction as well as during  assessments.    •     Realia, pictures, manipulates, magazines, newspapers, and books, are utilized in every classroom in the building to help  scaffold instruction when needed for ELLs.    •     The Award reading program is utilized in all ESL classes, and many general education and special education classrooms.   •     Our school has a site license for various online programs which provides animated videos to bring content to life.    •     Teachers also use pre-approved videos from the Internet to show real world examples of topics they are studying (i.e.- hurricanes, volcanoes, biology topics, etc.)  •     ReadingA-Z.com, MyOn, Maxscholar are also used in kindergarten and first grade classes to improve phonemic awareness,  print concepts, reading comprehension and fluency.          13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      Native language support is incorporated into ENL instruction throughout the day.  We accomplish this several ways.  One  strategy we utilize is partnering ELLs with a native language speaker.  We provide word-to-word glossaries and bilingual  dictionaries in students’ native languages.  We provide translators-either to peer or staff members when needed.  During class  discussions, group instruction, small group instruction, or one-on-one, students can use a variety of ways of communicating- pictures, representations, drawings, technology programs that offer translations and an interpreter to help them in both  languages.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All required services and resources correspond to ELL’s ages and grade levels as per CR-Part 154 and are scaffolded using ENL  methodologies and best practices.  The ENL teachers use the same Common Core Learning Standards that classroom teachers  use to plan lessons and guide instruction.  At times, we scaffold the content to make it more accessible to our newcomers by  providing high interest, low readability articles and books.  The ENL teacher collaborates with the classroom teacher and  shares resources.  These resources look like the resources that you would find in the general education class.  (For example,  you will not see cartoon ABC worksheets in a 5th grade class in our school.)        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    There are many instructional materials that are used to support our ELLs.    •     All classrooms are equipped with computer centers.   •     ELMO projectors  are in every classroom.   •      There are class sets of laptops on each floor.   •     All  classrooms have SMART boards or in the process of having smart boards installed.  •     The computer lab is in the process of being updated for the entire school to have access to.      •     Dictionaries and glossaries in student’s native language are used in content area instruction as well as during  assessments.    •     Realia, pictures, manipulates, magazines, newspapers, and books, are utilized in every classroom in the building to help  scaffold instruction when needed for ELLs.    •     The Award reading program is utilized in all ENL classes, and many general education and special education classrooms.   •     Our school has a site license for Brain pop which provides animated videos to bring content to life.    •     Teachers also use pre approved videos from the Internet to show real world examples of topics they are studying (i.e.- hurricanes, volcanoes, biology topics, etc.)  •     Reading A-Z.com, MyON and Maxscholar are also used in kindergarten and first grade classes to improve phonemic  awareness, print concepts, reading comprehension and fluency.          16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    52 is dedicated to promoting a safe, comfortable and welcoming atmosphere for newly enrolled ELL students.  Our plan to  assist newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school year includes the following:   •     Early Registration for  newly-enrolled students prior to the opening of school in September.•     Students who register in the last week of August get  to meet with one of our ENL teachers , parent coordinator and/or assistant principal and get a brief tour of the  school.  Students can see the main parts of the building, cluster classrooms, arrival and dismissal entrances and exits, and any  other place so they can see how the school is run.  •     After the HLS is administered, the child is given the NYSITELL before  school starts.  •     Parents have the opportunity to see one of the ESL classrooms and ask questions about our program.  At  that time, they are invited to the more formal, parent orientation meeting.  •     For students who registered earlier in the  summer or the previous spring, within the first ten days of school starting, the NYSITELL Test is administered to students  whose home language is other than English.•     During the registration and NYSITELL process, ENL teachers, the pupil  accounting secretary, the parent coordinator, administrators and translators work as a team to assist parents, address their  concerns, understand and complete forms, test, and assign placements for ELL students. •     Classroom teachers have been  trained to provide additional help to newly enrolled ELL students with their transition into a new environment.  Newly enrolled  ELLs are paired with a buddy student who speaks their language to help develop a support system for them.   Our school has a  large immigrant population so there are often many English speaking students in most classes who also speak the same native   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         language as new ELL students. These students have proven very valuable in helping to assist the new ELLs.  •     Students are  partnered up with two other students to form triads so that during a discussion, the new student can participate in their native  language and also benefit from listening to a genuine conversation in English.•     Starter packets are given to our older new  admits that teaches them important information about their new school, their home, and the neighborhood.                 17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We do not offer language electives to our ELLs.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The professional development plan for all ELL personnel (ESL teachers, general education, and special education teachers,  cluster teachers, paraprofessionals, related service providers, guidance counselor, SAPIS worker, secretaries, and anyone else  that have ELLs in their classes) is coordinated by our administration in conjunction with the staff.  Teachers are encouraged to  seek out Professional Development opportunities which they feel will help them become more effective teachers.  The  administrative staff collaborates to combine ideas and find opportunities for teachers to participate in effective professional  development and planning for teachers.  Teachers are rated on the Danielson rubric and when they are found to be highly  effective in an area, these teachers are being utilized to present PD to other staff members in order to promote student  progress and strengthen the staff’s knowledge base in literacy, mathematics, social studies and science and in effective  classroom practices to help all students meet the Common Core Learning Standards.   Professional development is presented  by the principal, assistant principals, Network staff, Professional Development consultants and ENL teachers throughout the  year at grade conferences, faculty conferences, and full day workshops.  The tentative schedule for professional development  for all personnel who work with ELLs is described below.  The professional development is presented to the entire staff,  including but not limited to:  paraprofessionals, common branch teachers, cluster teachers, special education teachers, ENL  teachers, Guidance counselor, psychologists, occupational and physical therapists, speech therapists and the parent  coordinator.  Professional Development is provided on Monday afternoons and Chancellor Conference Days.    Support is given by the school team comprised of administration, ENL teachers, guidance counselor,  and the parent  coordinator. This school year Ms. Jimenez created a professional development session for classroom teachers about how to  acquire and better understand the NYSESLAT data and use it when planning instruction.   Ms. Martinovic did a professional development for our staff about what strategies to use with our ELLs in order to improve  their reading comprehension. Professional Development is done on a weekly basis and monitored by teacher teams and  administration    School has been accepted in the Continuous learning program and will be using inquiry science to identify possible  intervention strategies and monitor their progress. Team members will attend bi-monthly professional development sessions,  targeting ENL instruction. We have also been accepted into the Learning Partners Program. This program is designed to create  culturally responsive instruction in early literacy for ENL students. Teachers will attend professional development sessions and  inter-visitations in partner schools.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Support is given by the school team comprised of administration, ENL teachers, guidance counselor, parent coordinator.    Professional Development is done on a weekly basis and monitored by teacher teams and administration.      ENL teachers are also sent out of the building for ELL specific professional development to Fordham University, and in  district PD sessions which they turn key to staff.     The professional development plan for all ELL personnel (ESL teachers, general education, and special education teachers,  cluster teachers, paraprofessionals, related service providers, guidance counselor, SAPIS worker, secretaries, and anyone else  that have ELLs in their classes) is coordinated by our administration in conjunction with the staff.

Professional Development is provided on Monday afternoons and Chancellor Conference Days.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   At P.S. 52 we recognize the importance of parental involvement in the education of all of our students including the  participation of our ELL parents.  We offer many opportunities for all parents to learn about the curricula and education that  their child receives. •     Parents are invited and welcomed into the school. •     The Parent Coordinator sends out a monthly  newsletter and daily emails keeping parents informed about what is going on in the school and/or in the community.  •     Each  grade also sends out a newsletter with the units of study, strategies to help their children, and upcoming events.  •     We keep  parents informed of the children’s academic progress (reading level and math level) through the academic updates sent home  in October and April. We send home a mid-year Progress Report in January which was created by the school to provide parents  more feedback in between the two report card distributions. •     In our report cards, parents receive the RISA report indicating  the students’ attendance data.  •     We have a strong Parent Association and we have 7 parents that sit on the School  Leadership Team.  •     Many workshops specifically target ELL parents, such as ELL Parent Orientation meetings where parents  are introduced to the different ELL programs, Title III meetings (orientation for ELL parents on Title III after-school programs  and special ELL Family Events), and Title I parent meetings. •     All information that is distributed to the parents of ELLs is  translated into as many languages as possible, and translations services are provided whenever needed.  •     In addition,  parents are invited and encouraged to participate in Family Sports Night where parents participate and learn about different  sports and activities they can play with their child teaching them the importance of physical activity, living a healthy lifestyle  and good sportsmanship.  •     Informational meetings to help students achieve in all academic areas are offered throughout  the year.  Informative testing meetings in both ELA, Math, and Science, SESIS meetings, Schoolnet meetings, STARS  information, the School Implementation Team process and information, Promotional Criteria meetings, Middle School  informational night, and Kindergarten Orientation meetings are a few ways that we help parents stay informed of the  standards and high expectations that we expect form all our  students.     •     Enrichment programs and extracurricular   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63            activities such as: music concerts, Science Fair, Arts Fair, Kindergarten Fair, Transition from Pre-K to Kindergarten parent  workshop,  Pajama read aloud where Pre-K through grade 2 students read with their parents and friends on blankets spotlight  the hard work of our students and shared with parents both during school and at night to accommodate all families.  •     As a  school we hold 2 evening fundraisers that have brought the school community together. •     Many families attend and look  forward to joining the school community and supporting their child’s school. •     Through our Halloween parties and Talent  Show we have increased parent involvement and have raised funding to purchase extra materials and programs.•     We offer  our non-English speaking parents an adult education class so that they can learn conversational English and speak to their  family and school community members. This program is offered through the Department of Education’s Adult and Continuing  Education Program.  Every year, the class is filled to capacity.   Also, our school offers to Kindergarten and pre-Kindergarten a  chance to sign up to participate in the Cool Culture Program. The students and families are offered free admission to certain  selected cultural Institutions in the City.  We use data from parent surveys to evaluate the needs of parents of English  Language Learners.  •     We use data collected from the Home Language Survey, which we can also access through ATS’s RAPL,  so we can assess the oral and written language needs of our parents.  •     The parent coordinator also makes every effort to  reach out to parents of ELLs to discuss their concerns and questions with the help of translators.•     Parent Association  meetings and School Leadership Team meetings offer a venue for parents to have their voices heard.  Administration, Parent  Coordinator, and school representatives at these meeting bring issues and concerns back to the ENL teachers and a plan is  made to address the subject.•     Staff who serve as translators are paid to attend these meetings to translate in Arabic and  Russian.  •     Reflection forms are distributed to parents after workshops and used as exit slips to ensure that we are meeting  their needs and addressing their concerns.  •     From this data, many opportunities are provided to our ELL parents to become  more involved in our school and their child's education.    These parental involvement activities meet the needs of the ELL  parents in several ways.  •     They give parents an opportunity to interact with other parents from the community and the  school.  •     Parents can feel comfortable and not threatened because information is presented in English and is translated into  their native language when needed.  •     Parents learn valuable information at the meetings as well as have the opportunity to  see their children interact with other classmates and school staff.  •     These family nights, meetings, and information nights  help our ELL parents become a part of their child's education which, in turn, will help the ELL family realize that they are an  essential, integral part of our school community    Every Tuesday we provide homework help for our Arabic speaking families. Families are invited to come in with their children  to work on homework together and see how they can better support their children at home. Babysitting is provided during this  time for families that would not be able to attend otherwise.   This year we also had art family art sessions where students and their parents came in together after school or on the  weekend to work on an art project together.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.      Our school works with a variety of Community Based Organizations that provide programs or services for parents of English  Language Learners.  •     We teach the children the importance of being part of a community and helping others through our  fundraisers for American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, and St. Jude’s children’s hospital. •     Students  collect pennies for Penny Harvest and collect canned goods for City Harvest.•     We have an affiliation with the Food Bank of  New York.•     Our Parent Coordinator works closely with our local Brooklyn Public Library Branch to assist ELL parents in  completing library card application forms and obtaining library cards.  •     The Sheepshead Bay Brooklyn Public Library also  offers free ESOL materials, classes and conversation groups which our parents are happy to take advantage of.  •     The Salt  Marsh Nature Center in Marine Park serves a vital role in our neighborhood.  The parent coordinator assists classroom  teachers in arranging field trips to the Salt Marsh Nature Center and many ELL parents accompany their child on these  visits.  •     The Urban Park Rangers use the plants and animals of the salt marsh as object lessons in a variety of subjects,  including ecology, botany, and ornithology. •      Also, our school offers several other workshops and meetings throughout the  year that are presented by outside agencies.  •     Weekly conversational English classes for ELL parents are offered through the  Department of Education's Adult Education Services so ELL parents can improve their verbal and writing skills.   •     Finally,  Learning Leaders present a parent workshop on Storytelling and Bookmaking where parents learn how to incorporate these  literacy activities at home with their children.  •     We have a partnership with our local homeless shelter where we donate  books, clothes, educational materials, and supplies to the families that are in transitional housing.  •     We offer an after  school program that is run by the Kingsbay Y five days a week.  This program is housed on site and provides educational  assistance, extracurricular activities, and cultural activities for our students.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

We were grouped with other schools, both district  and charter schools, outside of our district and had inter-visitations to see their strengths and weaknesses with their ells. We  shared ideas and created and inquiry specifically for our school that the team could help support us with.  This year we are focusing  on how we can support classroom teachers with entering ells on every grade level. We have attended PD on using the common  core progressions and have had Rosa Delgado come in for several sessions on training the staff on how to use the tool. We have  also created a reading club in which we discussed actives and strategies we would like to put in practice only after we tried them  ourselves.                           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kristin Hurley, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS Sheepshead Bay School                                                                              School DBN: 22K052  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We conduct our assessment of written translation and oral interpretation needs through our annual needs  assessment survey, informal interviews of parents and staff, Parents’ Preferred Language Survey, and data from  the Home Language Survey that is filled out by every parent when they register a student in the New York City  Department of Education. This document states any languages spoken in the student’s home and provides an  accurate census of the languages spoken by both the parents and students. The Home Language Survey also  shows whether or not a child and his/her family speaks English to a proficiency level high enough to understand  school communications without translations. These documents provide us with the necessary information needed  to communicate with the parents in the parent’s preferred language for both oral and written communication.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68      This information is collected and entered into ATS by the Pupil Accounting Secretary. A report is run in ATS (RAPL)  which shows the language of preference for oral and written communication. Teachers are given a list of the  preferred language of the parents of the students in their class. We have translators with in our school that are  able to translate our communities two most spoken languages Arabic and Russian. We also have staff that speaks  Spanish and use the DOE translating services if needed.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Below is a  breakdown of the data  collected from RAPL. The  data suggests that more  parents are comfortable to  have information that is  presented orally in their  native language. One  reason for this, is because  some of our parents are not  literate in their native  language. We inform the  teachers of this information  by giving them a class list.  Next to each student a  language is written which  indicates what language the  parents prefer to have  verbal and written  communication with the  school.    The majority of non ‐  English proficient students  and parents at PS 52 are  Arabic and Russian  speakers, but we also have   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69     a need for language  translation and  interpretation services for  speakers of Spanish, Uzbek,  Chinese, Georgian, Bengalil,  French, Ukranie, Urdu,  Polish, Turkish, Turkmen.    Parents have mentioned  that they often are unable  to bring their own  interpreters to school  meetings. These findings  were reported to the staff  and parent coordinator so  that accommodations can  be made to prepare for  written translations and  oral interpretations in a  timely manner. Also, the  findings are reported at the  school’s leadership team  meetings.    n/a   n   n           n/a   n/a   n/a   n/a   n/a   n/a   n/a   n/a   n/a   n/a   n/a   n/a   3.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Our school will provide each parent whose primary language is a covered language and who requires language  assistance services with written notification of their rights regarding translation and interpretation services and  instructions on how to obtain these services. A school sign is posted (in all available languages) near the primary  entrance to the school indicating the room where a copy of the notice for parents regarding language assistance  services can be obtained. We have posted from the Translation and Interpretation Unit a written translation of the  signage and forms required under Section VII of the Chancellor’s Regulations A-663 in the primary language of the  parent. The language identification guide is available in the office for parents to reference what language they require  translation services for.
