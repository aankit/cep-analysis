This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our mission is to promote a community of students, families, staff and administrators who will nurture the changing  intellectual, social and emotional needs of our students and direct their abilities towards the achievement of  exemplary performance, enabling them to become responsible, respectful and productive citizens. Toward this end,  we will maintain high expectations for our students and develop programs which foster critical thinking, high level  problem solving skills and the ability to adapt to our ever-changing global society. Our mantra is to never give up,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      encourage others and always do your best. P.S. 214 maintains high expectations for our staff and strongly encourages  parent involvement in school activities.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The Cadwallader Colden School, P.S. 214Q, is located in Flushing, Queens. We are a Title I PreK-5 school serving  approximately 460 students from culturally diverse backgrounds. We are a collaborative school dedicated to achieving  high standards of academic excellence for all of our students.    Our Theory of Action which includes our instructional focus and our Core Beliefs is centered on commitment from the  school community, fostering support and development in school staff and responding to student's needs.   Our school’s instructional focus for this year is:    To use assessment data connected to literacy and math and provide entry points for all students with an emphasis on   targeted subgroups. To this end we will ensure that:   Students will engage in tasks at their appropriate entry level in literacy and math.       Teachers will design tasks that are appropriate and accessible for all students including targeted subgroups in      literacy and math thus further ensuring the transfer of learning.  School leaders will regularly review student performance data and ensure that staff and students are provided  with the resources required for this focus.   Instructional initiatives in literacy include our continued implementation, revision and modification of the Balanced  Literacy Approach for reading and writing. This includes the ReadyGen Program and includes: a skill/strategy lesson;  read aloud; independent, paired, shared and guided Reading; Writing Workshop which includes: model, shared and  interactive writing. It also supports Word Study components, conferences and small group work. We will be infusing  Writing Revolution methodologies into reading, writing and other content areas. Our Literacy Staff Developer  provides professional development in a variety of ways which includes push-in, modeling and mentoring, as well as  supporting teachers during professional development sessions. For Math our school follows the Go Math! Program  which focuses on authentic and inquiry based instruction. In addition, we supplement Go Math! with Think Central,  IXL, Splash Math, Exemplars and other problem-solving strategy programs.    Technology is infused into all the curriculum areas through the use of classroom desktop computers, 3 mobile laptop  carts with one on each floor, iPad mini carts- two for the first floor, four for the second floor and six for the third floor,  individual classroom laptops, individual teacher iPads and Interactive White Boards. In addition, our state-of-the-art  computer lab is utilized by each PreK- grade 5 class at least once a week. Our science cluster teacher gives students  opportunities to model scientists’ methods of investigation through a “hands-on” workshop model and inquiry based  approach that incorporates scientific thinking processes in the science lab which is visited by all students once a week.  All students receive music instruction once a week in addition to opportunities to participate in assembly programs  that include music, dance and theater. In addition, our full time visual arts teacher provides in-depth instruction in a  studio environment. Students receive regular physical education instruction in the gymnasium and within the  classroom.    At P.S. 214 we recognize the importance of families and other community members in the academic and social  success of all our children. Our Parent Coordinator provides many well attended parent workshops that focus on  strengthening academic support in the home and increase parent awareness and participation in school events and  activities. In addition, we have partnered with the Office of School Health, specifically our liaison, Kallyope Kazalas and  have planned a series of Social Emotional Learning Workshops for Parents and Staff members. Our cluster and  classroom teachers provide learning annexes for parents to engage in with their child during our Tuesday parent   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      engagement time. Translators are provided for these annexes and workshops if necessary. Our school website is a  valuable resource for parents to access information information. The site includes upcoming events, schedules, grade  curricula, staff information, celebrations and important links for parents to access. School-home information is  translated and communicated regularly through a variety of media. Our art teacher regularly updates a monitor in our  lobby which displays information for our families and students. The running display contains important information  about upcoming events, celebrations, news and workshops in addition to student created artwork. The school also  uses Blackboard Connect, Class Dojo, and Remind for phone, e-mail and text message to update parents of weekly  events. Class Dojo is a voluntary parent app where teachers can share class information, post special events and share  student work. In addition, the administration and all out of classroom personnel can post to our School Story. This is  where we share information about spirit days, school wide celebrations, notices and reminders.    We provide students with opportunities to grow through: after school Reading & Math Support Programs; Title III  After School ENL Program; School Chorus; Our Cadwallader Colden After School Theater (CCAST) Program; Garden  Club; Newspaper Club, Recycling Committee; Science Fair; Basketball Team and Cheerleaders; Peer Mediators; Quill  Awards; and our Student-of-the-Month Program. We collaborate with Queens College and receive student teachers  for the fall and spring terms. Student teachers work alongside our classroom teachers and are provided guidance in  their practices. Our community based organizations such as Little Sweet Angels and Talent and Learning provide after  school opportunities for our students and are housed within P.S. 214.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Student Populations   Our school community includes a total of 19.8% English Language Learners, 12.5% Students with Disabilities, 10%  Gifted and Talented students and 30% Black/ Hispanic students. The needs of our English Language Learners are  addressed by helping them acclimate to the school community, form positive relationships with peers and adults, and  acquire the English language in both social and academic settings. The needs of our Students with Disabilities are  addressed by including differentiated instruction, providing them with authentic support driven by their IEP goals,  flexible scheduling and participating in the school community. The special needs of our Gifted and Talented students  are addressed by including differentiated instruction, offering activities for enrichment and providing students  opportunities to participate in the local and school community. Black/Hispanic students are a subgroup that the  administration, classroom teachers and support staff have targeted this year. Teachers have been directed to provide  this subgroup of students with individualized support during and after direct instruction and tasks that are accessible  in literacy and math. The administration will be tracking the progress of this subgroup regularly during the school  year.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Framework Progress   One area of progress is in Rigorous Instruction. Based on the School Quality Guide, our school provides students with  the resources and tools they need to include multiple opportunities for reading and writing experiences grounded in  evidence from text, both literary and informational and complex grade-level texts, Additionally, they had the  resources and tools they needed to include multiple opportunities for creating coherent progressions within the  standards from previous grades to current grade so student knowledge/skills build onto previous learning as  foundations for math concepts, for developing students’ conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, and their  ability to apply math in context. The 2017 – 2018 Quality Review demonstrated that our school is well developed in  Quality Indicator 3.4. Our report states "A culture of mutual accountability for all expectations is a result of the  training offered to all staff and families to support student progress toward reaching these goals."

A review of our Quality Review, School Quality Guide/Snapshot, Principal Performance Observations, NYS Test  Results, NYC Performance Tasks, NYC School Survey, Advance, NYS School Report Card and school-based assessments  (formal and informal), the following findings were noted:   As per the NYS School Report Card, P.S. 214Q has consistently met our AYP in ELA, Math and Science.   As per the NYS School Report Card, P.S. 214Q has consistently been rated a “School in Good Standing”.   Our school is fully integrated in the Danielson Framework to support the development of teacher practice through  observations, conversations, and feedback. Teacher teams have collaborated to build rigorous Common Core aligned  units of study and provide multiple entry points to engage all learners.   We provide opportunities for collaboration where teachers meet in grade level and cross graded/ content vertical  teams to strengthen student achievement and teacher practice using action research protocols to guide their work.  Teachers also work to reflect upon and refine curricula and instruction that will strengthen student outcomes and  increase student achievement. Our Quality Review Report indicates that we are well Developed in 1.1- Engaging  curricula and purposeful questioning techniques promote rigorous habits and higher order thinking skills across the  majority of classrooms. Purposeful decisions aligning curricula result in coherence that supports extensions for all  learners.    Multiple entry points are embedded in all unit plans addressing the needs of students with disabilities and the English  Language Learners (ELLs). All curriculum maps and supporting resources are held in a Atlas Rubicon portal for teachers  to reference and access regularly. Teachers use multi-grade maps to monitor coherence and to ensure scaffolding and  rigorous expectations for each grade level. Curricula design in Math includes unit goals, content area academic  language, multiple entry points and aligned formative and summative assessments.   Curriculum maps are written based on our Go Math! curriculum. Lead Math teachers customize curriculum maps to  indicate scaffolded vocabulary, prioritized skills and strategies, clarified learning objectives, potential misconceptions  and differentiated activities and supports.

A review of our Quality Review, NYC School Survey, Advance, Principal Performance Observations,Teacher surveys,  our Instructional Focus and our 2017-2018 Professional Development Plan indicate:   Our school provides opportunities for collaboration where teachers meet in grade level teams to strengthen student  achievement and teacher practice using action research protocols to guide their work. Teachers also work to reflect  upon and refine curricula and instruction that will strengthen student outcomes and increase student achievement. In  addition to grade level teams, our teachers work in cross graded/content vertical teams during half of our  professional learning time on Mondays.    Our Quality Review for 2017-2018 indicated, "There are both vertical and horizontal teacher teams that meet  regularly in order to analyze student data and pedagogical best practices. The work of teacher teams supports,  strengthens and improves teachers’ instructional capacity. Progress towards goals for specific groups of students  increased." Professional development opportunities aligned to this work supports teachers in their understanding as  to how to implement their curricular and assessment work.   Our Quality Review for 2017-2018, also indicated that our teachers are engaged in inquiry-based professional  collaborations. Distributive leadership structures provide a means for teachers to have input on key decisions about  curricula and teaching practices.

It also indicates a 9.5%  increase of our SWD students performing at a level 3 or 4 for the last three years. The percentage of our ELL students  performing at Levels 3 and 4, however, has decreased by 6.7% from 2017. Professional learning in all grades will focus  on expanding use of data as our staff works to align to learning objectives to tasks and assessments. Teachers have  been and will continue working on improving differentiation of instruction to meet individual needs to help increase  student progress. Staff will also concentrate on identifying students who were in last year’s lowest third, SWDs and  ELLs in ELA and set up action plans to identify and address their specific needs.    Data from our 2017 School Quality Guide indicated: 91% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that they had  opportunities to work productively with colleagues at their school on professional development.; 97% of teachers  agreed or strongly agreed that at their school teachers talk with one another about instruction; 81% of teachers say  that at their school teachers make a conscious effort to coordinate their teaching with instruction at other grade  levels.    Prioritized needs for Collaborative Teachers:     Additional time to support professional learning    Professional learning to be targeted to the individual needs of teachers as we work to improve   questioning/discussion techniques (3b in Danielson Framework for Teaching); engaging students in learning  (3c in Danielson Framework for Teaching) and using assessment in instruction (3d in Danielson Framework for  Teaching).      A need to improve embedded distributed leadership structures that influence key decisions in our school.     Professional learning focused on closing the achievement gap of target subgroups of students.

A review of our Quality Review, School Survey, School Quality Guide/Snapshot and Framework for Great Schools the  following strengths were noted for this area:      In the 2018 School Quality Guide:    o  100% of teachers say that the principal sets high standards for student learning.   o  97% of teachers say that the principal makes clear to the staff his or her expectations for meeting   instructional goals.    o  96% of parents/guardians agreed or strongly agreed that the principal/school leader at their school   promotes family and community involvement in the school.   o  97% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that at their school curriculum, instruction, and learning   materials are all well coordinated across the different grade levels.    o  97% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that, at their school, the principal/school leader   encourages feedback through regular meetings with parent and teacher leaders.   Based on an analysis of our student achievement data we have modified the work within our teacher teams to include  both literacy and math. Our Vertical teams meet to discuss and select their targeted subgroup of students. The team  will select and agree on the same subgroup and then identify students in that subgroup to work with in their class.  The team will then identify a common goal for the subgroup of students. The team will then make an action plan that  addresses the common goal for the subgroup. This action plan will include an instructional sequence of reading  strategies found in the Writing Strategies book by Jennifer Serravallo and methods of formative assessment to be  used during the cycle. Teams will implement the plan, discuss student progress based on assessments, and report any  adjustments necessary that teachers have made or need to make to their instruction. Teams will present to their  grade mates. Grade teams will identify how they will apply this learning to future units. Changes are recorded in  curriculum maps.    Our Horizontal teams focus on math. The lead teacher facilitates the work of the team which may consist of:  Deepening conceptual understanding of math topics, introduction to new units (i.e. identify priority objectives),  provide hands-on tasks, resources for supplementing with videos, worksheets and activities, project based learning,  explain problem solving / instructional performance tasks, provide professional learning from NCTM texts; Best  practices for supplementing Go Math!; 10 minute round robin reflection on completed units; At completion of unit  add exemplars to Atlas Rubicon; Performance task revision; Development of authentic problem solving tasks  embedded into each unit; Other math needs identified by the team as discussed with administration chart.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  P.S. 214Q provides orientation sessions for all incoming pre-school children and their parents regardless of which  program they attended before enrolling in our school (if any). We have two full time Pre-K classes. The Pre-K teachers  are an integral part of our staff and participate in all professional development. Ongoing articulation is conducted  between the Pre-K and Kindergarten teachers, Staff Developers and Administrators. Teachers and students utilize the  NYCDOE Pre-K curriculum daily. A social worker serves our Pre-K working with both pre-K students and their families.  Our Pre-K parents are invited to attend workshops to help them improve parenting skills, their knowledge of literacy,  mathematics and other content areas. Monthly Parent Workshops are facilitated by our Parent Coordinator with  activities and presentations by various staff members to acquaint the children and families with social and emotional  transitioning from school to school or home to school. Activities are planned to provide insight into varied curriculum  areas, health and administrative items. Our Parent Coordinator is our very active liaison between the parents and the  school providing and/or facilitating workshops and enlisting Pre-K parent support and involvement in school activities  and functions. In addition, Pre-K parents are regular participants in the Pre-K classrooms and articulate with the Pre-K  teachers on a regular basis.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Our teachers meet regularly during common preps and during professional development time to review unit plans  and make decisions for their grade about summative and formative assessments for ELA and Math. The teachers then  utilize this information to plan for future units, provide RTI for students and to identify those who may be at risk and  require further intervention. Our school also has a MOSL team who decides the local and state measure required for  their end of year ratings. All teacher utilize a school created data tracker system that allows us to monitor students in  a variety of ways: by grade band, by grade, by class and by subject and standard. We use this information to track  student growth or lack of it and then use it to provide more targeted AIS.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 214Q The Cadwallader Colden School, in compliance with the Elementary  and Secondary Student Act (ESSA) is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.S. 214Q The Cadwallader Colden School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community.      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.

The program addresses individual  student needs providing grade appropriate curriculum aligned to proficiency levels.  Approximately 45 students were eligible to participate in the program (in 2017-2018 SY) and are  in grades 2-5. The program is offered to all of our ELLs in these grades, including Newcomers,  Developing and Long-term ELLs, ELLs with special needs, as well as Former ELLs. For the  2018-2019 SY, 47 students are eligible to participate in the program.  Final groupings are made  according to the number of students who choose to attend.  The students are grouped based on  their English language proficiency levels (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding,  Commanding) and data from the EDAT (will be updated in 09/2018).  Groups are also formed  around needs of ELL sub-groups, with emphasis on the Newcomers and Developing ELLs.  Currently, we do not have any SIFE students enrolled.   The funding for the After-School program is devoted for a total of 20 class sessions which meet  every Tuesday from 2:20-4:00 p.m for a total of 1 hour and 40 minutes per week.  The program  began on November 21, 2018 and will end on April 17, 2019.  Students acquire and strengthen  academic language, as well as reading and writing skills, through technology, hands-on projects,  and supplemental listening, speaking, reading and writing activities. The content focus is  Literacy and Math.  These are two areas of ELL need as indicated by 2018 NYSESLAT data  from the EDAT, NYS test results and various school-based assessments.  The classes are co-taught in English by 3 teachers: 1 dually licensed Common Branch and ENL  teacher and 2 licensed Common Branch teachers, experienced in providing ENL instruction and  knowledge of program materials.  The TESOL certified ENL teacher collaborates in both  planning and delivering direct instruction along with the Common Branch licensed teachers. The  ENL teacher assists the other teachers in implementing ENL strategies during direct instruction,  as well as helps plan activities and choose appropriate materials and resources. The ENL teacher  also helps to monitor students' progress during the supplemental program. Teachers  are responsible for monitoring and recording student work and progress, as well as attendance  which is taken daily.  Teachers utilize instructional approaches that bring together ENL  strategies, techniques and methodology with a standards-based Literacy and Math specific  curriculum.  The program is delivered in a small group setting which centers around a high  interest literacy text in an engaging content topic, focusing on language structures and academic  vocabulary. For math, the activities involve real-world application of critical thinking and multi- step problem solving, with a focus of comprehension of word problems and providing  justification of math solutions in a well constructed response.   Materials used in the After-School program are distinct from those used for daily  instruction.  Team-teaching and flexible groupings are typical ways in which the students are  provided with direct instruction from both the ENL and content area teachers.  Chinese and  Spanish are the dominant languages of ELLs in our school.  However, the program is conducted  in English. Teachers utilize home language supports to deliver direct instruction, such as  bilingual texts and multimedia presentations and online translation programs and apps.  Students  in the supplemental program also engage in an instructional software program called  Duolingo.  This program allows students to practice and acquire English language skills at their   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   individual levels using native language supports.  An online literacy program, Reading A-Z, ELL  component, is used as a supplemental resource during our program as well. Teachers present  students with engaging texts chosen based on which language skills are needed, as well as  proficiency level of students in the particular group. The students are engaged in close reading  and developing academic vocabulary through various structured activities. Those activities  involve developing student discussion, group-based projects, vocabulary games and written  responses. Progress is tracked through teacher informal assessments as well as student self- assessments. Teachers also monitor progress by using reading assessments such as TC running  records. Other materials used in our Title III program are Oxford Content Area picture  dictionaries. These books are used mainly with the Newcomer student group because they focus  on developing basic and content-specific vocabulary by providing visual support and sentence  frames to help students participate in a discussion and use the words in context. We also plan on  purchasing a subscription to Brain Pop ELL to engage our Newcomer, Developing ELLs, as well  as ELLs with special needs student subgroups in acquiring English grammar skills through visual  and auditory means.    rationale  teachers to receive training   schedule and duration  topics to be covered  name of provider   Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.    ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  Begin description here:             All teachers in the Title III program are engaged in an ongoing professional development  throughout the duration of the program. The certified ENL teacher and the Common Branch  teachers in the Title III program meet for half an hour each Tuesday afternoon, during the  professional development time, to discuss ENL strategies and reciprocal training of strategies  that the ENL teachers have received from Queens North and other professional development  sessions.  In addition, professional development to all staff is provided through grade  conferences, faculty conferences and small group and/or 1:1 meetings depending on need.  ENL  teachers provide professional development for classroom and cluster staff.  In-house staff  developers provide Title III and classroom teachers with training in correlating the Balanced  Literacy and Everyday Math curriculum with ENL strategies and methodology.  ENL strategies  are also correlated with our science, social studies and art programs through grade and faculty  conferences.  Five days have been set aside for per diem coverage of classroom teachers and/or  other staff responsible for ELL instruction and services to attend conferences, training and/or  inter-visitations to better understand and implement effective instructional strategies.  This is at  no cost to the program. This information is then shared with our teaching staff at subsequent  meetings.  Staff is also provided with professional development books and Internet resource  websites.  Teachers receive training to utilize technology (i.e. interactive whiteboards, laptops,  audio-visual modalities) to enhance ENL instruction.  ENL Teachers attend monthly professional  development workshops provided by the district. Classroom teachers in grades K-5 also attend  ENL specific professional development throughout the year which focus on academic language,  writing, and other areas in need of improvement.

The name of this workshop is "Title III ELL Parent Workshop".  The  workshop is provided by the licensed ENL teachers.  This session is geared towards exposing our  parents of ELLs who attend the supplemental program to the various activities and strategies  used during the program.  Parents are invited to the first session at the start of the program along  with their children.  Each teacher in the program prepares an engaging and interactive activity  that allows parents to work with their children.  The activities may include, but are not limited to,  topics such as creating and expanding sentences, playing vocabulary games, "unlocking" a  complex text, or solving a real-world math problem. In addition, the teacher sets aside some time  during this session to review the topics and materials that ELLs will be learning and using during  the Title III program, as well as resources and tips for how parents can assist their kids at  home.  The certified ENL teacher is available for any questions regarding the ENL program or  ENL strategies being used.  For this session, we utilize our bilingual paraprofessional staff to  translate for parents who require translation.  These staff members speak Mandarin and  Spanish.  Should need arise, we would secure a translator in another language.  Our parent  coordinator collaborates with the Title III teachers in preparing the letter which notifies parents  of the engagement activity and uses the above-mentioned bilingual staff members to translate the  notice.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses a variety of assessment programs to assess the early literacy skills of our ELL population.  There are numerous  programs that are utilized in the beginning of the school year.  These programs are implemented continuously as methods of  formative assessments and are also given at the end of the school year.  These programs include TC Reading benchmark levels  and running records to assess students' reading levels, primary assessments to gauge various early literacy skills, ReadyGen  formative and summative assessments  (Performance Based Tasks), ReadyGen End of Unit Assessments for grades 2-5, Go  Math End of Unit Assessments, and Measures of Student Learning (MOSL), which includes the Beginning of the Year and End of  Year tasks. Additionally, our school uses the NYS ELA, Math, Science (gr.4), NYSITELL and NYSESLAT test scores to inform and  drive instructional programs. The NYSESLAT data reveals a pattern of Transitioning and Expanding level ELLs repeatedly scoring  higher in the Speaking and Listening domains, while scoring lower in the Reading and Writing domains. Writing in particular,  has been the most challenging modality for our Expanding level ELLs. Therefore, our instruction in the ENL program focuses on  reading and writing strategies, such as close reading and text-based discussions; complex sentence structure and use of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      domain-specific vocabulary. The NYSESLAT data reveals that our Entering and Emerging students need supports across all the  domains, which is why our Standalone ENL instruction focuses on basic English acquisition with a focus on plenty of  opportunities for students to speak in and listen to English. We utilize the EDAT tool to review data patterns and risk factors  affecting our ELLs. Using this data, we plan our instruction focusing on the areas of need.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teachers and administrators use the data gathered from the aforementioned formative and summative assessment tools to  inform planning of effective instruction and gather useful resources, as well as creating additional supports to help our ELL  students.  Teachers review the data continuously during teacher team meetings and Action Research Inquiry Teams, where  they identify patterns and implement any changes to the grade curriculum maps in order to improve instruction.  Teachers  meet in both vertical and horizontal teams to review student work and implement various reading strategies and assessment  tools and determine their effectiveness.  Based on this data, teachers form small groups, provide students with RTI services,  and administration provides additional services such as Title III or Test Prep after-school programs.  Teachers make necessary  adjustments to the curriculum using Atlas Rubicon.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs based on various tools.  The ENL teachers and administrators focus on the  NYSESLAT data, reviewing each modality and the proficiency scores.  The school leadership also reviews school-wide goals and  focuses on goals for ELLs.  Through informal assessment and observation, teachers assess students' progress in the Title III  program and review its correlation with the NYSESLAT, as well as other NYS tests.  All teachers use the various assessments  utilized in our school to monitor ELLs' progress.  Summative and baseline assessments used to identify progress and areas of  need are the NYSITELL, Spanish LAB, TC benchmarks and running records, and Beginning of the Year MOSL. Through the use of  these various tools, we identify the areas of need for our ELLs. Our Entering and Emerging level ELLs have consistently shown  to have most need in the Speaking and Listening modalities. We focus on providing many opportunities where these students  can practice speaking through partner discussions, guided and shared reading, group presentations, etc. The areas of need for  our Transitioning and Expanding level ELLs have repeatedly been in the Reading and Writing modalities. Many of our  Expanding level ELLs have scored the lowest in the Writing modality. We focus on working with those students on complex  sentence structure and using Tier 2 and 3 vocabulary words.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered, teachers meet in both vertical and horizontal teams to review student work and  other data to identify trends and patterns, make adjustments to the curriculum in Atlas Rubicon, and provide appropriate  differentiation and additional supports such as Tier 1 and 2 RTI.  Based on NYSITELL results, the ENL teachers form small  groups based on students' proficiency levels.  Based on the Spanish LAB results, the ENL teachers collaborate with other  bilingual Spanish speaking staff to provide additional help in the students' home language.  Based on the NYSESLAT, the ENL  teachers identify areas of need to inform their instructional goals and additional services such as Title III After School and/or  Title III Summer School programs.  Based on the NYS tests, all teachers and administrators identify areas of need and students  who may need additional supports such as At-Risk/Tier 3 Interventions and/or after school test preparation  programs.  Teachers and administration collaborate with RTI/SETTS staff to provide those additional services and supports,  such as pull-out and push-in small group instruction or Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI).     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Students who scored in the bottom third on the ELA, will receive additional small group instruction from our Literacy Coach  and the AIS staff.  This instruction will focus on needed skills based on the reviewed test data. Students who scored above a  level 2 will receive continued small group instruction with a focus on skills and strategies that show need of  improvement.  After-school programs, such us Title III and Test Prep are offered to provide students with additional support  and practice.  Teachers continuously utilize the RTI framework throughout their instruction to provide targeted support,  including Tier I and II intervention strategies.  Guided reading groups, IXL math program and various technology-based  resources are utilized continuously to help students improve across all proficiency levels.   Teachers and administration   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         collaborate with RTI/SETTS staff to provide those additional services and supports, such as pull-out and push-in small group  instruction or Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI).     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The outcome assessment data that is used to evaluate and inform our ELL programs come from the results of the NYSESLAT,  NYS tests, and End of Year MOSL.  We also use data from ongoing formative assessments gathered from both the ENL  and general education teachers, which may include ReadyGen and Go Math assessments.  Administrators and ENL teachers  continuously use the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) and various reports from ATS to compile data and track ELLs' progress. The  NYSESLAT Modality Analysis portion of the EDAT allows the ENL teachers to compare the students' scores across the  modalities. We zoom in on the modalities which received the lowest scores for majority of the students. Based on that, we  then implement skill-based instruction to help our students improve in that area. The risk factors for each student in the  Student at-risk summary report are also analyzed by the ENL and Special Education teachers to recommend RTI services, which  will deliver small group targeted instruction. The NYSESLAT and ELA / Math comparison report informs us of how the  ELLs performed on the state exams in comparison to the NYSESLAT. We use the ELA / Math item analysis report to pin point  areas of strength and need which will be addressed throughout the instruction in both ENL and classroom settings.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   In the beginning of the year, ENL teachers run the RLAT report and analyze the results of the most recently administered  NYSESLAT.  Teachers analyze the RLAT report to carefully look at each students' test results in each modality of  the NYSESLAT.  By looking at the modalities individually, ENL teachers plan instruction accordingly to strengthen the areas in  which students struggle the most.  Based on the NYSESLAT, the ENL teachers identify areas of need to inform their  instructional goals and additional services such as the Title III After School program.  After administering the NYSITELL and  Spanish LAB to eligible students, the ENL teachers form small groups based on students' proficiency levels.  Based on the  Spanish LAB results, the ENL teachers collaborate with other bilingual Spanish speaking staff to provide additional help in the  students' home language.  ENL teachers share these findings with the classroom teachers and collaborate on appropriate  differentiated small group activities that can be done during the instructional day.  Throughout the year, teachers review data  from formative assessments during inquiry meetings to make appropriate adjustments to instruction. To disseminate the data  findings for our ELLs, the ENL teachers dedicate portion of the professional learning time throughout the school year to meet  with teacher teams and inform them of trends revealed by the data, such as the lowest third performing group of ELLs and the  modality in which they have scored the lowest on the NYSESLAT. The ENL teachers share the at risk indicators from the  EDAT for individual students with those students' classroom teachers in order to form small groups and provide RTI as needed  during class instructional time. Another structure in place at our school where ELL data is disseminated is during our monthly  PPT meetings. Special education teachers, administrators, ENL teachers and the School-based Assessment team members are  all present suring these meetings. We share the data patterns and at-risk factors for our ELLs and discuss next steps to adjust  instruction or provide additional help.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our school employs a push-in/pull-out model of ENL instruction. There are two full-time and one part-time certified  TESOL teachers who service ELLs.  ELLs are grouped by proficiency level across each grade band.  Integrated and  stand-alone ENL is implemented by the ENL teachers who are all dually certified in TESOL and common branch   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         licenses.  Instruction is delivered in a small group setting. Based on the 2017-2018 school year ENL roster, Integrated  and Standalone ENL program is implement in the following manner: Kindergarten ELLs receive Integrated ENL services  through push-in co-teaching model. First and second grade Standalone ENL program is delivered in a pull out small  group setting, consisting of both grades in one group. First and second grade Integrated ENL is delivered separately in  a pull out small group, with Transitioning and Expanding students grouped together. Third grade ELLs receive both  Standalone and Integrated ENL in a mix proficiency level group. Fourth and Fifth grade Entering and Emerging  ELLs receive both Standalone and Integrated ENL services in a small group setting. Similarly, fourth and fifth grade  Transitioning and Expanding level ELLs receive Integrated ENL in a small group setting. ELLs are grouped by proficiency  level and receive services either in a group consisting of the same grade or in a group with two contiguous grade  levels. That way, we ensure that all ELLs receive their mandated minutes of both Standalone and Integrated ENL.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Our Entering and Emerging level students receive 360 total minutes of ENL of which 180 minutes are focused on integrated  instruction supporting ELA and 180 are for stand-alone ENL.  During both program models Home Language Arts are  incorporated by using various resources and tools in students' home languages.  Our Transitioning and Expanding level  students receive 180 total minutes of ENL of which all are focused on the integrated ENL/ELA instruction.  Former ELLs receive  90 minutes of integrated ENL.  In addition to the services provided by our ENL teachers, ENL teachers collaborate with  classroom teachers to aid in planning and differentiation of instruction for ELLs, incorporating HLA and using ENL methods to  integrate ENL with ELA instruction.          3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   The ENL teacher’s method of instruction assists the ELL students, regardless of their proficiency level, to quickly and  comfortably assimilate and transition into the academic and social community of P.S. 214.  ENL instruction is designed to align  curriculum and instruction with the NYS Common Core State Standards in math and literacy.  The ENL teacher utilizes teacher- created curriculum maps to align ENL instruction with regular classroom instruction.  In addition, the ENL teachers pre-teach  content area vocabulary to support ELLs.  Approximately 25% of instructional minutes are allotted for home language support  through the use of bilingual glossaries, dictionaries, books and translated vocabulary, question prompts and discussion  starters.  Students also receive Home Language Arts instructional support through the use of the Duolingo program, that  supports both HLA and English language acquisition.  The ENL teachers mirror classroom instruction by using curriculum maps  and communicating with the classroom teachers on an on-going basis.  Content is made comprehensible by the use of  numerous ENL strategies such as vocabulary instruction with picture and home language support, academic language  modeling through discussion starters, sentence frames and question prompts.  Close reading is implemented where students  can access complex texts with scaffolds and teacher support.  Text dependent questions and partner/group discussion help  foster reading comprehension. Differentiated leveled texts on the same topic help students across all proficiency levels access  the content. We also utilize various technology resources, such as IXL and Think Central in Math, Science A-Z, Reading and  Vocabulary A-Z, Discovery Education, RazKids, Brain Pop, Duolingo, and other language oriented iPad apps.  We implement the  Writing Revolution methodologies to help students with syntax in their writing.  Our lower-level proficiency students also  receive support to make content comprehensible by teaching them BICS language through various content areas, so that  learning the English language and content occurs simultaneously.           4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      ELLs who are Spanish speakers are evaluated using the Spanish LAB during the initial identification process.    Based on the Spanish LAB results, the ENL teachers collaborate with other bilingual Spanish speaking staff to provide additional  help in the students' home language.  ENL teachers share these findings with the classroom teachers and collaborate on  appropriate differentiated small group activities that can be done during the instructional day.  During the NYS exams,  students are given a choice of answering in their home language for the Math and Science exams and they are given bilingual  glossaries to use during all NYS exams.  Throughout the year, classroom teachers encourage ELLs to write in their home  language, which later is translated by an in-house translator.  The Duolingo program allows teachers to monitor student  progress in regards to English language acquisition through the parallel use of English and the student's home language.  Our  Chinese speaking ELs are informally evaluated throughout the year by bilingual Chinese speaking staff members, such as the  RTI teacher and other paraprofessionals.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Currently, our school does not have any SIFE ELLs.  However, we are prepared to differentiate instruction for those students  should they enroll at our school.  For SIFE students, we are prepared to have remedial instruction in a small group setting  delivered by a licensed TESOL teacher, as well as an RTI teacher.  We will use home language supports to make content  comprehensible.  We will utilize various ENL methods and scaffolds to help our SIFE student(s) acquire BICS English efficiently  so that they may continue acquiring academic language.  SIFE students will be offered additional help through the Title III  programs.  Instruction is differentiated for long term ELLs who usually require the most support in accessing complex texts and  comprehending reading and writing on grade level.  To support those areas, we have our licensed TESOL teachers and our  Literacy Coach deliver small group instruction focusing on specific reading and writing skills that the ELLs may need help  in.  Long Term ELLs are also be invited to our Title III program for additional support.  Our newcomer ELLs receive  differentiated instruction both in their regular classroom and in the ENL program.  We use leveled texts from the Scott  Foresman Reading Street book series to help newcomers access content area topics.  We use the Oxford Picture Dictionary for  the Content Areas program to support both BICS and CALPS vocabulary development.  We use home language supports such  as bilingual glossaries, dictionaries, content area picture dictionaries, vocabulary folders, discussion prompt cards, word banks,  vocabulary word walls and bilingual books, as well as various online websites and technology tools, such as Reading A-Z which  has numerous leveld texts available in different languages, and iPad apps that help students practice "survival" and academic  English.  Our Developing ELLs also receive differentiated instruction both in their classrooms and in the ENL program through  the use of leveled texts, vocabulary pre-teaching, word banks, discussion starters and online programs available at our  school.  Teachers continuously implement small group work that is strategy or skill specific to help developing ELLs improve  their reading and writing skills through the use of guided reading instruction.  Former ELLs receive transitional help by getting  90 minutes of integrated ENL.  The teachers employ close reading strategies to comprehend complex texts, discussion  strategies to aid in higher order critical thinking and writing in response to reading with a focus on using text evidence to  support their answers.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELLs who are also SWDs are given differentiated work and scaffolds across all subject areas.  In our Go Math program, Think  Central is utilized to deliver animated videos which model math concepts and strategies.  The Grab and Go Math Center, which  uses games and texts to provide further practice of math skills, as well as various manipulatives, allows students with limited  English proficiency greater access to the curriculum.  In our ReadyGen literacy program, students with special needs as well as  ELLs receive differentiated activities, graphic organizers, guided reading groups, small group instruction, phonics readers, etc.  to help them access and comprehend our literacy curriculum.  Across all subject areas, students are able to use tools that  utilize home language, technology to research and publish their work, peer partnerships that foster cooperative work,  sentence frames and starters to help them participate in class discussions, and checklists and self-assessments to help them  understand and complete tasks.  ELL-SWDs also receive various accommodations on tests, as per their IEPs.  Our Leveled   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      Literacy Intervention program is also used to help ELL-SWDs to practice decoding, fluency, and other basic reading  comprehension skills.  ELL-SWDs who are mandated to have a one-to-one paraprofessional are often paired with a bilingual  paraprofessional who is able to provide home language supports to access both English language acquisition and content area  learning.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL-SWDs receive all services mandated on their IEP and regulated by CRP-154.  Various service providers work alongside the  classroom teachers to help students achieve their IEP goals.  Our school strives to provide flexible scheduling and delivers  various services through push-in and pull-out models.  Integrated Co-Teaching classrooms are found across every grade level,  where the Special Education teachers work in collaboration with the general education teachers, as well as additional service  providers, such as ENL, OT, PT, counseling and speech therapy. All service providers and classroom teachers communicate with  each other so that everyone involved in the child's education is aware of specific goals and child's needs. These meetings take  place during our Tuesday teacher work time, common prep periods, as well as during any IEP meetings. The child's parents are  invited to play an active role and made aware of all that's being done to help their child.          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our school offers various intervention programs for ELLs such as LLI, RTI, SETTS and At-Risk Intervention, Title III After  School/Summer School programs and after school test preparation programs.  Intervention programs are delivered by the RTI  team, which includes our RTI teacher, literacy coach, special education teachers and other service providers.  The team  delivers small group Tier III intervention strategies, along with classroom teachers who continuously provide Tier I and II  interventions in their instruction. Targeted ELL subgroups who receive the Tier III interventions include, but are not limited to,  developing, long term, and ELL-SWDs.  Newcomer ELLs receive rigorous English language instruction with the supports of their  home language through our ENL teachers.  Chinese and Spanish speaking staff, including classroom teachers, RTI teachers and  paraprofessionals, are utilized to support our newcomer ELLs in informal assessment.  All of our intervention programs are  offered in English, with the support of home language as needed. The interventions in ELA and Math involve specific skill based  small group instruction; skills are identified after reviewing student data.  Close reading focusing on comprehension and higher  order thinking is targeted.  Basic math skills, as well as problem solving through the use of math vocabulary, word problems  and manipulatives are the target of the math interventions. All interventions are based on current data and focus on specific  needs of our targeted students.            9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Although our school has a wealth of available technology, we will continue improving teacher practice in using these tools to  improve instruction. Through our Professional Learning, teachers will share their best practices in using various technology  resources, as well as any other beneficial strategies that can meet our school's goals for our ELLs. We will be looking into online  based programs, such as the First 4000 words program, which can improve our ELLs' vocabulary and reading.  Although we  utilize Duolingo app in the ENL program, we will be looking to access additional professional development opportunities for  classroom teachers to learn how to incorporate this technology into small group instruction for newcomer ELLs.  We will be  looking into attaining Duolingo Certification for Educators that is offered through the Innovation Partner Professional  Development Program, which is a part of Chancellor Carmen Farina's commitment to ensure students graduate from  NYC public schools with the digital skills they need to succeed.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   There will be no programs/services for ELLs discontinued at our school.         11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs in our school are involved in numerous programs and services and are always invited to play an active role in our school  community.  In addition to our mandated ENL program, ELLs take part in their classroom's annual performance during which  they participate in dancing, acting and musical production.  Their parents are invited to watch the performance, as it is an   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      exciting part of our school.  We also offer the CCAST after-school theater program which puts on a Disney musical production  every year.  It is a program where all students in grades 3-5 are invited to audition for acting roles, as well as scenery and  costume design and back-stage production. We have a basketball team and a cheerleading team, where ELLs along with the  rest of the student body can audition and become a part of the team.  Currently, we have ELLs involved in both teams.  We  have a chorus and band that meets during school and puts on concerts throughout the year.  We have a Garden club where  students learn various science concepts and tend to our school garden.  We have Peer Mediators, where students serve as  mediators among their peers to help resolve some conflicts. We have an annual science fair where our ELLs can prominently  display their scientific experiments.  Every Spring, we have a Field Day during which all students participate in physical  activities facilitated by our Physical Education teacher.  We also have a student-led school newspaper where ELLs are invited to  play an active role in reporting and publishing school news.  Our PTA organizes numerous events, to which ELLs are invited to  along with all the students, such as holiday dances, the Book Fair, PTA meetings, candy sales etc.  Throughout the year we have  various assemblies, such as the NED anti-bullying assembly during Respect for All week.  Additionally, ELLs gain greater  exposure to hands-on learning experiences through participation through various field trips offered by their classroom  teachers as well as through the ENL program.  ELLs in grades 2-5 take part of our Title III after-school program which provides  them with supplemental English instruction and targets areas of academic need.  The program runs from October to February  and is co-taught by ENL and classroom teachers. We also offer an after-school test preparation program to ELLs in grade 3-5  who will be taking the state ELA and Math exams.  Both ELLs and their families are afforded equal access to all the programs  and services mentioned above through active parent-school communication.  Translation and interpretation services are  always utilized to ensure that all information about our programs and services is disseminated to all the parents.  Both in- house staff translators as well parent volunteers make sure documents and informative flyers are translated, as well as phone  calls made home.            12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Our ENL and classroom teachers use a wide variety of instructional materials to support ELLs' learning. Technology resources  include Smart/Intelli/Triumph boards in every classroom, iPads, laptops and desktop computers, and online based programs  and websites (Reading A-Z, Raz Kids, Discovery Education, IXL, Brain Pop, Think Central, Duolingo). These technology materials  allow students to access the curriculum through an alternate way and make content more interactive and engaging. They also  allow for differentiation as each ELL can use materials on his/her level and use their home language to work at their own  pace.  Other content area materials include the Go Math Grab and Go center which has math games and math books to  support the math concept/skill being taught.  Math manipulatives, such as cubes and base-10 blocks, are used in all grade  levels.  Spanish speaking ELLs have the option of using the student workbooks in Spanish.  All other language groups have  access to bilingual math glossaries and dictionaries.  Our Science program incorporates hands-on activities, experiments and  observations to allow ELLs to access the Science curriculum despite their English language proficiency level.Bilingual glossaries  and dictionaries are also used.  In our literacy and ENL programs, ELLs use materials such as vocabulary cards, word banks,  word walls, sentence prompts crafted for various activities, discussion starters, question prompts, anchor charts, picture  dictionaries, and bilingual texts.  These materials utilize picture support as well as student's home language.  ELLs have access  to differentiated paper choice and graphic organizers to help them with writing and leveled books for their independent  reading time.  We are very proud and excited to offer students individual iPads to use all technology based programs.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support in our ENL program is delivered by having various materials and resources available in the students'  home language.  Currently, majority of our ELLs speak either Chinese or Spanish.  Our ENL teachers utilize our in-house  bilingual speaking staff for translating vocabulary, question and discussion prompts, word banks, etc.  Google translate is also  used as an aid in translating texts and other materials.  A bilingual student or staff member ensures that translation is  accurate.  Our ENL program also has numerous books available in the dominant languages to supplement students'  independent reading. We use bilingual picture dictionaries and glossaries.  The ENL classrooms and students' regular  classrooms have multilingual labels and basic "survival English" phrases available for our newcomer ELLs to easily adjust to  their new setting. Go Math program has students books available in Spanish as well as bilingual math vocabulary on the Think  Central website. Our bilingual staff regularly reaches out to parents and guardians of ELLs and uses their home language to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         communicate vital information.  The Duolingo online program offers English language learning through the use of their home  language.  Students are paired with partners who share the same home language during discussion and group work.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All instructional materials are aligned with NYS Standards for each grade level that ELLs are enrolled in.  ENL teachers use  NYSESLAT Targets of Measurement to plan instructional goals that match ELLs' age and grade levels.  Teachers evaluate various  materials and resources to ensure that they are grade and age appropriate.  ENL teachers use scaffolding techniques in regard  to any and all instructional materials.  ENL teachers collaborate with classroom teachers to ensure learning objectives are  aligned with the grade level and the standards.  ENL teachers use curriculum maps to mirror classroom instruction and ensure  it is on grade level.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our school does not share a building.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELLs and their parents receive information about our programs at the time of registration from either the  school secretary, parent coordinator, administrator and/or ENL staff member.  All ELL families are invited to our "Meet the  Teacher" Night, ELL orientation at the beginning of the school year, and various ENL workshops throughout the school  year.  The Parent Coordinator, ENL teachers, administration and our in-house translators maintain constant communication  with ELL families throughout the year to inform them of any school activities, programs, or workshops.  ELLs are invited to  participate in all school programs and events regardless of when they enroll in our school.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All teachers at our school are continuously involved in professional development.  Professional learning takes place during the  designated time on Monday afternoons, as well as Chancellor's PD Days, special workshops, etc.   Our Literacy Staff Developer  models how to combine components of ReadyGen lessons to allow for Multiple Entry Points for ELLs and SWDs, Enrichment,  Small Group and identify opportunities to use technology to increase engaging all students and support ELLs and SWDs.  Teachers learn to modify questions embedded in ReadyGen to increase the complexity of questions and create opportunities  for student discussion using DOK  to encourage all students  to use data and text references to support and to build on each  other's ideas during class. Teachers are involved in learning how to differentiate the content, process and product to make  curriculum accessible for our ELLs.  During PD time, teachers meet in vertical groups that focus on specific reading strategies  and formative assessments.  They collaborate on various reading strategies and formative assessments which they then   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69         implement in their classrooms and analyze the effectiveness.  These sessions take place in cycles.  At the end of each cycle,  teacher teams present their findings and outcomes.  During PD time, teachers meet in horizontal teams to modify and  implement changes to curriculum maps through Atlas Rubicon.  These changes may include things such as remediation and  enrichment activities, for ELLs, SWDs and our lowest performing third.  Classroom teachers and supporting staff collaborate to  ensure growth for all students on summative tasks measured by school-wide rubrics. Additionally, our school uses  Dropbox and Atlas Rubicon to store, and thus, make available, materials and resources for all staff.  This ensures alignment of  instructions and assessments across vertical grades.  Based on data from formative and summative assessments and from  Inquiry research, teachers continue to revise curriculum maps in literacy and math to make each unit and chapter more  rigorous and meet the demands of the learning standards and to offer multiple entry points.  By examining student work,  teachers can develop skills and share ideas on how to improve student achievement.          In addition to the above-mentioned professional development plan for all ELL personnel at our school, ENL teachers frequently  attend professional development workshops and seminars that are offered by the district, DOE and the teacher's union. These  workshops focus on various ELL specific topics, such as academic language, vocabualry instruction, accessing the standards,  differentiating instruction, incorporating home language supports, and other key components of ELL instructional.  Teachers  learn about new research trends and methodologies that they can use to support ELLs, as well as turn-key to the rest of the  staff.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  In addition to the school-wide professional development, and individual outside workshops, our staff also collaborates with  our Guidance Counselor who provides assistance and information regarding middle school.  Staff members will also be trained  in Transitional Activities that provide College and Career Readiness to all students.       15% of our school-wide professional development plan for all teachers focuses on ELL specific professional learning. Our ENL  teachers turn-key vital and useful information gathered from ELL specific workshops they have attended outside of the school.  While the professional learning opportunities vary in the topics they cover from year to year, the most recently attended ones  included Advanced Literacy for ELLs, SIOP model of instruction and the use of formative assessments, as well as compliance  related workshops. These professional learning opportunities support the ELL students by allowing the teachers to increase  and deepen the best practices concerning teaching of ELLs. For example, the Advanced Literacy PD has helped our teachers  gain new strategies of delivering higher order thinking questions, unpacking complex texts and teaching Tier 2 and 3  vocabulary. In addition to attending PLO's ,teachers view educational training videos that model various ENL strategies which  they can then implement in their classrooms.  ENL teachers and our literacy coach model and share their best practices for  ELLs by showing video clips of their ENL instruction and samples of teacher-created materials.  ENL teachers work as part of  teacher teams during Action Research Inquiry and curriculum mapping with Atlas Rubicon to aid classroom teachers in  implementing ENL strategies and differentiation into the curriculum.  ENL teachers attend ELL specific workshops as part of  their 50% total hours of professional development, as previously stated.  Record of these activities is kept by keeping  attendance during each professional development session as well as retaining each workshop's/session's agendas.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL teachers, with assistance from our in-house translators, reach out to ELLs' parents/guardians via phone and/or written  communication to schedule individual meetings.  These meetings generally take place during our Tuesday afternoon parent  engagement time, although if needed parent requests can be accommodated to meet at a different time.  Once a meeting is  scheduled, the ENL teacher prepares any necessary information, such as student work or test results to share with the parents.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70            During this annual individual meeting we discuss the goals of the program by sharing some of the instructional goals,  objectives and expectations. We share the language proficiency assessment results through the NYSESLAT score report where  we also pinpoint language development needs by looking at the modality in which the student has scored the lowest. We  discuss the results of other tests in other content areas, such as the state exams in Math, ELA and Science, and  lunit assessments for lower grade students. These results show parents their child's needs across all the content areas.The ENL  teacher can request one of our bilingual staff to aid in translation and interpretation, as these staff members are available  during our parent engagement time.  ENL teachers are also aware of the over-the phone Translation & Interpretation Unit, in  case staff members are not available to translate.  Records are kept for the annual individual meetings with ELL parents by  using an online parent communication log created by our administration.  If the teacher so chooses, they can also keep written  logs of all parent meetings and communication.  To ensure parent needs are accommodated, parents can meet with the  teacher in person during a designated time or if a mutual time can not be met, teachers can hold a conference over the phone,  via email or through letters.         2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   ELL parents are invited to all of our parent workshops facilitated by our parent coordinator, literacy coach, ENL teachers and  other staff members.  Every year we hold informative parent workshops centering on homework help, preparing for the ELA,  Math and Science state exams. In addition to our "meet the teacher night" and ELL orientation, we hold a spring NYSESLAT  workshop that focuses on the elements of the exam, proficiency levels and test scores and placement for the following school  year.  Parents are given various resources that they can use to help their children prepare. Other activities that foster parent  involvement include the use of Remind and Class Dojo, which are phone texting and web based apps and programs that foster  ongoing communication between teachers and parents.  These tools have built-in translation options to assist non-English  speaking parents with receiving pertinent information.  Parents are informed of important reminders regarding school and  class events, such as field trips, assemblies and performances which they are invited to attend, as well as their children's  academic progress. The letters that are sent home are translated into the predominant languages spoken by our parents,  which include Chinese and Spanish. Many of our staff members who are bilingual make phone calls to also translate pertinent  reminders. Our PTA organizes various activities and reaches out to parents to get involved in and volunteer their time and  help, such as school store  and candy sales, Book Fair, PTA meetings, school dances, and end of the school year celebration in  the school yard. Various grades host different celebrations, such as Thanksgiving feasts, to which parents are invited to.  Our  cluster teachers hold learning annexes so parents and children are invited to participate in hands-on activities that reflect on  what the children have been working on in each class.     Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    Our ELL students and parents play a vital role, not only in our school, but in our local community as well.  At P.S. 214  we believe  that ALL teachers are teachers of ELLs.  We strive to ensure that ELLs, as well as all students, meet their academic goals and their  social-emotional needs are simultaneously met.  We foster this notion by creating a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere  and culturally responsive instructional plans.  We truly believe that P.S. 214 is a family and each child, parent, and staff member is  an integral part of the future success of our school.                         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Denise Fuccillo, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S. 214 Cadwallader Colden                                                                              School DBN: 25Q214  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The HLIS, ATS, and OTELE are forms used to assess the written and oral interpretation needs of parents. Surveys  of attendance at parent workshops and conferences are taken by the administration to further determine  interpretation needs. Discussions are conducted with staff, the PTA Executive Board and the parent coordinator to  ascertain and assess prominent language groups and their needs. The school’s Demographic Report, along with  the RLPA Adult Preferred Language Report, are also reviewed to gather information and identify trends.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74   Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral             Language    We found, by assessing  the Adult Preferred  Language Report (RLPA),  that 1 parent speaks  Araucanian,1 parent  speaks Tamil, 1 parent  speaks Macedonian,1  parents speaks  Cantonese, 2 parents  speak Bengali, 13 parents  speak Korean, 25 parents  speak Mandarin, 74 speak  Spanish, 249 parents  speak Chinese and 378  parents speak English as  their home language.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.            Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      Document Name    Month/Frequency Distributed to   How do you plan to translate?   Families    Include procedures to ensure timely  provision of translated documents      to parents.       Our school disseminates the parent  handbook, that is published in four  languages (English, Chinese, Spanish  and Korean) at the beginning of the  school year.
