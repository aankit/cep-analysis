This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   1. Mission: Our mission is to provide students with an education that empowers them academically, socially, and  economically, with an emphasis on building skills necessary to thrive in the 21st century.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Validus is consistently recognized by students, families, and visitors for having a family-like atmosphere and a  commitment to the whole child. This is supported by our partnerships with BronxWorks and buildOn. Through  BronxWorks, our students engage in a program called Teen Action to address issues of concern to teens, as well as  receiving additional support from an on-site staff person, daily. From buildOn, our students engage in international  and local service learning, leadership, and peer mentoring programs, as well as receiving additional support from an  on-site staff person each day. We also have an outstanding athletics program and extensive extracurricular activities.   Validus has partnered with several prominent organizations whose programs contribute to creating a college  preparatory academy. They include: CBI - College Bound Initiative. CBI's full time, school-based Director of College  Counseling (DCC) works closely with the principal and teachers to create a college-going culture that raises the  expectations of parents and students. DCC guides students to overcome barriers to college entry through early college  awareness activities, and application, financial aid and enrollment support. Validus also receives support from the  following Bronx Community College TRIO Pre-Collegiate Programs: Upward Bound, Talent Search and Upward Bound  Stem.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   2. Our school is located in a high-needs area, and our students come to us with an average ELA proficiency of 2.42  and math proficiency of 2.15, according to the school’s Quality Guide (2016 - 2017). In addition, over 83.1% of our  students qualify for free or reduced lunch. Nearly 28% (27.7%) of our students have IEPs and 16.1% of our students  are ENLs. NINE percent of our students are over-age and under-credited. I COULD NOT FIND THIS STATISTIC] Our  school community works tirelessly to provide students with additional academic and socio-emotional support to  help our students succeed.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   3. Since our 2016-17 Quality Review Report was not finalized until June 7, 2017, we have no Framework element  rating except Trust, for which we scored 4.08. This score represents a significant improvement from the previous  year's score of 3.39. What this means is that our students will continue to achieve academic success because all the  constituents (parent-to-teacher, parent-to-principal, student-to-teacher, teacher-to-principal and teacher-to-teacher)  are trusting of each other.       A key area of focus for 2017-18 was Rigorous Instruction: Specifically pedagogy and aligning assessments to curricula.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 09X263   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   372   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Strengths     During 2016-2017 we saw increases in Regents scores in for Algebra 1 CC (from 18% to 35%% passing),   Geometry (from 0% to 14%) Although our ELA scores went down by 4%, we continue to sore above schools in  our comparative group and those in our borough.      During 2016-2017, we saw an increases in our overall College Readiness Index (from 7% to 28%) Specifically,   students college readiness scores in Algebra 1 CC (from 7% to 21% and Geometry from 0% to 7%        Needs      ELA Regents scores decreased between 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 (from 73% to 59%).   US History scores decreased between 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 (from 27% to 21%).   Living Environment scores decreased between 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 (from 37% to 27%)              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, the average passing score on a standardized test (Regents, AP exams) will have increased by 10  percentage points over the previous year (as compared to June 2018) from 43.3% to 53.3%. Strategies for achieving  this goal include an emphasis on independent reading, direct vocabulary instruction, research based and  argumentative writing, text analysis and citing evidence.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12   Summer  2018;  September  2018 - June  2019   PD Team   Department Chairs  (CPAs)   AP for Department   Principal     Part 3a – Action Plan   In June, 2018 members of the administration, support, and  teaching staff--as well as the head of the Parents Association  and a student--gathered for our annual retreat to develop,  discuss, and create strategies around the school goals noted  above. The purpose was to closely examine our pedagogical,  community-facing, and operational practices; and establish a  series of action plans that are designed to improve student  outcomes and more effectively engage the community Validus  serves. We started by using a SWOT protocol, reviewing the  strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the  previous year's goals. After hours of discussion, we formulated a  slate of new goals for the 2018 - 2019 school year, and devised  a number of next-steps to fulfill the mission and the vision of  those goals, the first of which follows:      Goal 1 (Rigorous Instruction) - By June 2019, the average  passing score on a standardized test (Regents, AP exams) will  have increased by 10 percentage points over the previous year  (as compared to June 2018).   Next Steps:      Each of the four core content areas--ELA, Math, Science,   and Social Studies--developed department goals that  are in alignment with the school wide goal. (Humanities  represents the ELA and Social Studies departments). As  such, Humanities generated the following:    o  By June 2019, 80% of all students will be able to   achieve mastery in analyzing evidence to  support a conclusion. To support that, the  Humanities team developed a set of  Instructional Priorities, a framework for  teaching in the coming year:    Independent Reading   Direct Vocabulary Instruction   Writing - Students will write research-based argument and  informational essays. Skills include establishing a claim,  analyzing and citing evidence, acknowledging opposing claims,  and crafting a rebuttal   Feedback for Students - CFUs (Checks for Understanding) which  can come in a variety of forms: written, oral, through the use  technology, and student conferences                                                                                 2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      Be advised that the Instructional Priorities above also support  STEM students and teachers. For example, our data show that  students struggle with Living Environment vocabulary, as  indicated by their scores in the multiple choice section of the  Regents exam. Proving direct instruction in this area could help  reduce some of the challenges students are facing in this  regard, and improve performance.       Other next-steps include:    Developing electives around the needs of the students--SAT and  remediation electives, for example   Create Honors classes to challenge high-performing students  and to keep them engaged        The Math department set goals which closely reflects   the school wide goal:   -By June 2019, 80% of students will achieve mastery on  analyzing and drawing conclusion about data.         Science: By the end of January 2019, 90% of science  students will master 85% (out of 25 questions) of words  and terms in a vocabulary test.   Following the retreat, a team of CPAs (lead teachers who are  focused on Curriculum, Pedagogy, and Assessment) met to  develop a series of Professional Development cycles which will  be conducted by various staff members throughout the school  year. The cycles are designed to inform and strengthen teacher  practice. The topics include, but are not limited to:       1.  Differentiation   2.  Lesson Planning   3.  Class Management   4.  Higher-Order Questioning for Teachers and Students  5.  Supporting ENLs in Our Classroom   6.  Co-Planning   7.  Regents Data Analysis   8.  Using Technology in Education   9.  Vocabulary PD   10.

Effective Text Coding (annotation)  13. Teaching struggling readers    Other next-steps include:       1.  Examine Regents passage rates per grade level, ENL,   SPED, teacher and per attendance, instead of just  overall subject   2.  Use Homework Cafe and/or 8th period as a study hall   3.  Have College Block (morning advisory period) teachers   review progress reports with students more often   4.  Use data in class to track performance more often and   have students write a reflection about their work    5.  Use team time to review progress reports and check in   on goals    6.  More translated materials for ENL students   7.  Work with Attendance Team to create ways to improve   attendance   Teachers and staff will reconvene the week before school starts  for the 2018 - 2019 season to review and refine goals and next- steps.

Here at Validus, we have a two tiered hiring committee. Once teaching candidates are identified they are first  interviewed by teachers, then administrators. They then are asked to prepare and execute a demonstration lesson  and meet with an administrator for debriefing and reflection. Once on board, our Model and Peer Collaborative  coaches work and supports teachers with curricular writing and lesson planning. They receive: 1) weekly professional  development based on the PD cycle below 2) attend weekly department team to plan and refine curricular and 3)  grade team. Their is a department chair for each content area who facilitate the bi-weekly grade and department  meetings. Our model teacher coordinates inter visitations among teachers and her class serves as a model for  teachers to visit to see exemplary pedagogy in action. All teachers are engage in lesson study and are encouraged to  attend off-site professional development offered by the Bronx Field Center, ASCD or other professional organization.

They then used this information to create a  diagnostics, interim assessments and final assessments over the course of SY15-16. In their reflection surveys,  teachers recommended to the coaches that Formative Assessment should be the first cycle in our PD plan for the  year.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.       For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and  Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Students are either enrolled in Course Offering or  Credit Recovery. Course offering is a class given so students can take a class they have never sat  for before and students will receive a grade for their work. Credit Recovery is an opportunity for  students to retake a class they have failed an additional time.     PM school is offered in both the fall and spring semester. It goes from Wednesday, September  20th, 2017 to Thursday, January 11th, 2018. It then resumes on Wednesday, January 31st, 2018  and lasts until Wednesday, May 30th, 2018. The language of instruction is in English with  supports in Spanish from Mr. Bell. The program used to provide the curriculum (Common Core  aligned) is called Apex Learning. Unfortunately, Apex Learning only offers its courses in  English. However, according to our contact at Apex Learning, they will be adding course  materials in over 10 languages by the summer of 2018 with the exception of ELA coursework.

Parental permission slips are stored in the main office.    Saturday School - The Saturday school ENL program helps students with low-levels of English  and are often at either the entering or emerging level. They are exposed to a variety of activities  through direct instruction.

Professional Developments  ensure that teachers further their careers by keeping their skills current. All our PDs are aligned  with the Danielson Framework for Teaching. Additionally, teachers of ELLs go to a series of  professional development seminars that are led by NYC DOE trainers from the Bronx. The ENL  teacher subsequently turnkeys the materials and pedagogical practices to other VPA staff  members because all teachers are teachers of ELLs. This ensures that all of our ELLs are offered  well-rounded instructional practices at all times.    Our school has PD cycles offered by leadership committee of teachers that work at Validus  Preparatory Academy. These teachers meet regularly to plan PD, and they represent several  departments at VPA. In addition, there are PD series that are hosted by the Bronx Field Support  Center. ICT training has also been held to focus on various co-teaching pairings; overcoming  potential obstacles; and successful integration methodologies. This PD is led by Hana Mosa,  ASE.Topics to be covered in PD include, but are not limited to, the following: grouping  schemes; differentiation strategies; scaffolding/sentence starters; incorporating physical  involvement with language; how to maintain a low-stress environment in classrooms; and the use  of high skills/low skills peer pairing.    Professional Development has also been provided to teachers who utilize the Read180 program,  the Math180 program, the ten teachers who teach PM school (3 to 5 PM on Wednesday and  Thursday), Castle Learning (entire teaching staff), and Skedula (entire staff).

Aside from the four parent-teacher conferences held each school  year, Validus Preparatory Academy strives to supplement parental involvement by inviting  parents to take part in the same Saturday Academy activities as the ELL students.  Aforementioned Parent Teacher conferences have Spanish/English translators to work with the  large Spanish-speaking at VPA. Saturday sessions take place on Saturdays from 9AM to 12 noon  on the VPA campus. Activities include workshops on how to help children with their homework,  how to obtain citizenship, and school family nights. These sessions are led by a combination of  teachers, guidance counselor, administrators, college counselor and administrative staff in both  English and Spanish.      Attendance records for the aforementioned activities is taken by Mr. Gueye, a paraprofessional  who works at VPA.    All communications with parents are in both English and Spanish, be it verbally through a phone  call or through written communication. Activities and outings are planned with the four language  modalities in mind: reading and listening (receptive) as well as speaking and writing  (productive). Additionally, pronunciation is a focal point as are literacy strategies. Parents are  notified of these opportunities both directly (phone calls and letters home) and indirectly  (postings on school website and social media notices).Parents of ELLs are invited to come to the  outing, which take place on Saturdays, via Validus’s Saturday Academy. Parents can monitor  their child’s APEX activities via parental login and password system. APEX will be translated  into ten or more languages by the summer of 2017.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use the data from 2017 NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, and Spanish Lab assessments which helps us determine students listening,  speaking, reading, and writing capabilities. This information helps with instructional planning and to determine literacy  levels. We also use this data to create students' programs as to adhere to the required minutes based  on NYSITELL/NYSESLAT scores in the beginning of the Fall semester and again at the beginning of the Spring semester.  Additionally, interim assessments are given periodically throughout the year to determine if students are able to write a claim,  counterclaim, and analyze evidence. These assessments are developed by the teachers in each department at Validus  Preparatory Academy.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      The articles that students read are offered in multiple languages. Also, glossaries are provided for the more difficult or subject- specific vocabulary words that appear in the included articles. In addition, for Regents bearing classes, bilingual glossaries that  are provided by the state are given to ELLs for classwork and exams. Within the classroom setting, ELLs are paired with non-ELL  students in their core classes who share a common first language. As such, the ELL students have access to linguistic support as  they engage with the material in the classroom.    With regards to the assessments, the results are reviewed during both grade team meetings (9th, 10th, and upper academy)  and at department meetings (ELA, History, Math, and Science), teachers within said meetings design curriculum specific  lessons that adhere to the common core standards and the content-based standards. These meetings happen twice a week,  either during 4th period (when the students have their lunch) or after school (Tuesdays until 3:55pm). These lessons are  "workshopped" by one of the three teacher coaches and given actionable feedback for further steps.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Students take initial assessments at the beginning of the school year in multiple subject areas (ELA, History, Science, and Math)  that serve as a diagnostic exam. This is to see what they know, what they struggle with, and what they need to learn. This  assessment is designed by the respective departments at Validus.    The NYSESLAT results are also used to identify progress and areas of need. For example, for ELL students who receive low  scores on the reading and/or sections of the NYSESLAT, they are enrolled in an elective course for credit called Read 180. Read  180 is a learning intervention program that builds students' reading comprehension, academic vocabulary, and writing skills.  The program assesses student reading levels (lexile levels) and then provides customized instruction that give ELLs  opportunities to practice new reading strategies through writing activities.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Students with composite NYSESLAT scores that fall in the Entering and Emerging range are placed into the stand-alone ENL  course for additional practice in reading, writing, speaking, and listening.     Using Title III funding obtained, the ENL teacher was hired to work with ELL students after school in the after school  enrichment program that is offered Wednesdays and Thursdays after school from 3pm to 5pm at Validus over the course of  Fall and Spring semesters. Students are enrolled in courses to recuperate credits or as a course offering. The ENL teacher  pushes in various classrooms working with students enrolled in ELA, Algebra, Government, US History, etc. This Title III funding  is also used to secure additional licenses from Apex Learning so ELLs have the opportunity to catch up on their credits.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   All teachers at Validus Preparatory Academy have access to SESIS and pedagogues are encouraged to read through their  students' IEPs to get a better sense of the most effective strategies in which individual ELLs with disabilities learn.     If the student has yet to be identified as having a learning disability, we try to look at what the problem is and determine if it is  a language difficulty or, in fact, a learning disability. We present this information with supporting materials to  parents/guardians in an effort to obtain an evaluation (which can be provided in a student's first language) to determine if  there is a learning difference. If there is, teachers can come up with a differentiation plan in order to get said students to  succeed.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The assessments used are the NYSESLAT scores and other Regents exams. For students who either need to pass the Regents or  achieve a college ready score (that number varies based on subject of the Regents exam), students are placed in a semester  long review/prep course for credit to raise their score for the upcoming Regents exam. These courses are only offered to  students who have either yet to pass the Regents or attain a college ready score.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68           For the Algebra Regents exam, there is a positive correlation between NYSESLAT proficiency level and Regents score. That is to  say that the more proficient an ELL is in the English language, the higher the Algebra score. There is an especially strong  correlation between reading competency and Algebra score. When ELLs pass the Regents with a 65 or higher (55 if they have  an IEP), they are programmed for Geometry unless they have yet to pass multiple semesters of Algebra.    The following is a breakdown of ELLs who have completed the Algebra Regents exam over the five delineated categories.  There are some ELLs who appear in multiple categories (ie newcomer SpEd ELLs, etc.) and some ELLs do not appear because  they have yet to take the Algebra Regents:    Newcomers: (3 of 8 have passed Algebra Regents)  Developing: (3 of 10 have passed Algebra Regents)  Long-term: (14 of 30 have passed Algebra Regents)  ELLs with Disabilities: (9 of 19 have passed Algebra Regents)  Former ELLs: (3 of 6 have passed Algebra Regents)     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We use both Skedula (a program which tracks all of our students' Regents grades) and data given from New York State about  recent Regents results that can be found in ATS.    As a result of the large population of ELLs who have not passed the Algebra Regents, there have been a lot of adjustments to  scheduling. For example, the ENL teacher pushes into the After School Enrichment program after school twice a week for two  hours each (3PM to 5PM). The majority of ELL students are enrolled in Math and English courses, so the ENL teacher roves  between those designated classrooms during the aforementioned time period. Additionally, as the majority of our ELL  population (87.9%) identifies as having Spanish as their home language, Spanish-speaking ELLs who need to pass the Algebra  Regents have the option of taking the Saturday Regents prep course in Spanish as one of the three Algebra teachers is fluent in  Spanish. If these Spanish-speaking ELLs would rather take the Algebra prep course in English, that is entirely up to them.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   There is a stand-alone class that is heterogeneous in terms of both grade and ability level. The class is 50 minutes long  and it meets five times a week. Within the class, students are grouped according to their ability level in such a way  that all proficiency levels are meeting the mandated ENL minutes of instruction. Due to our seniors being the  expanding/commanding students we had to place them in the standalone elective course in order to service/program  them for their entitled minutes.  In addition, there are ELA sections in 9th and 10th grades that are reserved for ELL  students. Also, in global history, living environment, earth science, and chemistry there is a teacher present 5 days a  week who is a certified ENL instructor.    Students do not travel in "blocks" and are un-graded as some students enroll in the 9th grade with high school credits.  Additionally, students transfer into Validus in the middle of their high school career and may have never been  exposed to certain classes depending from where they transferred. Student transcripts are thoroughly reviewed to  meet graduation requirements.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69         b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Before each school year, the programmer is given a result of the NYSESLAT scores using the RLAT in ATS for all ELLs (including  Commanding ELLs) and the required weekly minutes for each ELL classification. The student is then programmed with courses  in which there is an ELL certified content teacher or push-in teacher to satisfy the mandatory time requirement.    On Thursday, October 5th, 2017, the school programmer and ENL teacher at Validus went to a training entitled "Programming  High School ENL Services" at the Bronx FSC to review student programming as it pertains to STARS. Using a spreadsheet  generated by the trainer, one pedagogue identified certain class sections as being integrated ENL, and the other ensured that  the minute requirements were met.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   In our Freestanding ENL program, core content is taught in English with Spanish as native language support for our Spanish  speakers and stand-alone ENL being the two exceptions (Spanish is used in varying degrees according to proficiency levels and  years of service). In courses where Spanish is not used as a language of instruction, glossaries are provided in Spanish, French,  and Arabic along with bilingual dictionaries. iPads with the Google Translate application are also available for students during  the school day. Also, content specific glossary books are available in history, science, and math in all classrooms.     Teachers use New York State standards in Science and Social Studies. For Math and ELA, the common core learning standards  are implemented. Teachers create curriculum maps and unit plans to adhere to grade specific guidelines. Teachers have  common planning time in which the ENL teacher can review the lesson plans of the content area teachers and provide  linguistic supports within the lesson and in the classroom. Content is accessible by all students via previous co-planning and  the creation of supports that allow students of all linguistic capabilities to access the material.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   The ENL teacher is fluent and literate in the Spanish language and ELA teachers generally accept work to be written in Spanish  provided the student is either entering or emerging. With regards to other subject areas, work submitted in Spanish is  accepted in Regents bearing courses as the knowledge of content is what is being evaluated regardless of language used.  Additionally, state exams are provided in home languages along with the English language version, allowing students to  complete the version of which they feel most comfortable.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    A) SIFE students are generally paired with students who speak a common language. This is to provide support for students who  are new to the school, but also to help SIFE students who are low in literacy. In addition, SIFE students are recommended to  take Read180 so they can build their literacy towards becoming at grade level in reading and writing.  B) Newcomer ELLs are automatically enrolled into the Stand-Alone class and are partnered with an ELL student who has scored  as Commanding or Expanding on the most recent NYSESLAT exam. Handouts are given to these students in both English and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      their primary language so students can refer to the same document in multiple languages. Students also have access to  sentence starters and a glossary for any writing assignment where students are tasked with writing extended responses in  English. These students also have the option to sign an iPad contract. In doing so, students gain access to software that has  both written and oral translation capabilities.  C) Developing students are given the same materials as newcomer ELLs. In some cases where students have demonstrated  independence from linguistic supports, certain supports are no longer provided so students can continue to improve their  abilities in English.  D) Long-term ELLs often have issues with reading. As such, many have been enrolled in our Read180 program, which is a half- year course dedicated to developing student reading skills and introducing reading strategies depending on the task.  E) Former ELLs are placed in the ELL-specific ELA section so they can have access to differentiated instruction and materials  should they need it. Additionally, these students might be receiving instruction in an integrated-ENL co-taught class in either  history or science.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The ENL teacher pushes into the 9th grade ELA self-contained class, the 10th grade ELA ICT class, and the 9th grade ELL class  (which contains SpEd ELLs) four times a week each week. Additionally, the ENL teacher pushes into the Geometry section that  contains ELLs and SpEd ELLs three times a week. In two of the Living Environment sections and one of the Earth Science  sections, there is an instructor who is certified in both Special Education and English as a New Language. In addition, one of the  Global History classes has the special education teacher working with SWDs and SpEd ELLs.    SpEd ELLs have what are called tiered outcomes. According to their tier placement in a given core class, what is expected of  them is varied. Student tier is determined in part by what is stated in their IEP and also by the progress that they're making in  any given unit. If students are struggling in grasping a certain concept (establishing claims, analyzing textual evidence,  synthesizing data, etc.), they are placed in a tier that grants them additional support and more direct instruction with a  pedagogue within the classroom. Supports can range from a note sheet that is partially filled in because certain students have  delays in writing down information. By doing this, students are continuing to practice listening/reading within the classroom  and are allowed to focus on the more essential information. In order for peer to peer interaction to take place, which is  important in the development in oral proficiency, students are given sentence starters so they can properly engage in  classroom discussion. Additionally, small groups are formed with the idea that authentic speech can take place for ELLs who  have speech impediments or anxiety when it comes to addressing the entire class.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  All ELL-SWDs have an ENL instructor in their ELA class. Additionally, one of the science teachers at Validus is also certified in  teaching special education and the teaching of English to speakers of other languages. As such, the students have a teacher  who not only is very familiar with their IEPs, but can assess their linguistic deficits during instruction. This teacher also pushes  into ICT classrooms that have both general education students and students with IEPs.    The students who are in the 9th grade self-contained class received specified instruction based on their understanding of a  concept (as determined by formative assessment). It is called tiered grouping, which takes into account information from their  learning disability and linguistic deficiency. All other ELL-SWDs not enrolled in 9th grade courses are in an ICT setting, which is  less restrictive but differentiated in such a way that they receive linguistic supports. For example, they are given a sentence  starter so they can access a coherent written response or provided with transition words/phrases to have ideas flow  cohesively. Each student's IEP goals are reviewed regularly by the special education team at Validus.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  For students that have failed core classes or are missing credits, Validus students are required to attend either PM school  and/or summer school to recuperate these credits. For PM school, the ENL teacher who is also fluent in Spanish is employed to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71      give access ELL students who are struggling to understand the content of the Apex Learning program and need help. The ENL  teacher focuses on entering, emerging, and some transitioning students. As such, the coursework is offered in English with  Spanish support where necessary (with the exception of the Spanish class). Courses are offered in Living Environment, Earth  Science, English 9-12, Global History, US History, Spanish, Robotics, Algebra, and Geometry.    For students who are planning to take a Regents examination for the first time or have failed an exam in the past, there is  Saturday Regents review that is taught from 9AM to 12 noon the nine Saturdays leading up to the Regents exam week (in both  semesters). These courses are taught entirely in English with the exception of Algebra. One section is taught in English and the  other is taught in Spanish as one of the math teachers at Validus is fluent in Spanish. Students who consistently attend  Saturday school have a 90% passage rate on the Regents exam for which they prepare.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Our school restructured its instructional goal for the 2017-2018 school year by building onto what was established last year.  Last year, the goal was intentionally lofty as 100% of the students were to be able to write a claim and counterclaim as it is a  college-level skill. We fell short. 75% were able write a claim and 60% of students were able to write a counterclaim. Now, the  goal is for 85% of students to be able to write a claim, a counterclaim, and to be able to analyze relevant evidence to support  their claim. This will be measured periodically (between marking periods) in ELA, social studies, science, and math courses by  having the students complete interim assessments.    Homework Cafe is being introduced to Validus this year. It will be led by 8 senior scholars who are in great academic standing  and supervised by one pedagogue and two paraprofessionals. It will meet from 2:45pm to 4:00pm after school on Mondays,  Tuesdays, and Thursdays. It is a calm and peaceful atmosphere where students can focus and get their work done.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Not applicable.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All school programs are sent home to students and are given a hard copy in school in both English and Spanish. This includes all  field trips, after school clubs, and volunteer organizations that have partnerships with Validus Preparatory Academy. This  includes the student council. Additionally, all orientation sessions (for parents and students) are given in both English and  Spanish as there are many members on the school administrative team that are multilingual.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  ELLs have a wide variety of resources at their disposal at Validus Preparatory Academy. Every classroom is equipped with  Spanish / English dictionaries and some also have English to Arabic and English to French. Additionally, all science and history  classrooms have subject-specific English to Spanish (and vice versa) glossaries with terms in history and the sciences.  Additionally, iPads are distributed to ELL students that allow them to use the translation applications to aid them with reading  and writing texts. There is also a feature that allows students to talk into the iPad in their first language and it will translate the  phrase into English. It also pronounces words and texts for students so they know how they words sound when pronounced.     With regards to technology, most of the classrooms at Validus Preparatory Academy are equipped with working SMART boards  and some have Elmo document readers to project images. This helps with ELLs who are visual and need to see how to  annotate and decode a text. The SMART boards are equipped with speakers which allow for audio output. This helps with  pronunciation, intonation, and listening skills. Videos are also used in classrooms to supplement instruction. Many of these  videos have closed captioning so students can see how the words that they are hearing are spelled.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is provided to students in many ways. First of all, all typed handouts are translated into home  languages and distributed with the English version so students have access to both at any given time. For classes where the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72         content is not the English language itself, students are allowed to write in the language they feel most comfortable to them.  This is done because home language has no bearing on many of the Regents bound courses. Many teachers at Validus are  fluent in Spanish, which is by far the most common home language (aside from English) of the student body.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Each year, the programming coordinator looks over a long list of data before coming up with the schedule for the fall  semester. This data includes NYSESLAT scores from the previous school year, which determines the weekly number of minutes  ELLs need to be serviced. The student's graduation requirements are reviewed so it can be determined how the student can  receive their ENL time requirement from the certified ENL teachers. Another factor that comes into play is what the IEP calls  for the ELLs who pop up in the SESIS database. This may alter their schedule somewhat depending on what the IEP stipulates.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The main resource that is shared between the three schools at the Bathgate Campus that has an effect on the ELL students  would be the library. It is the only space in which the three days of Listening, Reading, and Writing portions of the NYSESLAT  can take place where all ELLs can be tested without interruption. As such, the administration of the three schools need to plan  together to determine what days have the access to the library in the timeframe.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Each newly enrolled ELL is given an orientation by the parent coordinator and other administrative assistants, all of whom are  fluent in both Spanish and English. Students are asked to bring transcripts and other documentation from the schooling they  received in their home countries to determine an appropriate course schedule and to make a determination as to how many  credits they have. This is done by the guidance counselor with the help of the college counselor (who knows Spanish) so he can  translate the transcript. In nearly all cases, the student is promptly introduced to the ENL teacher as they need to be assessed  for English language ability. Newly-arrived students are paired with another student who is bilingual and has a generally  favorable reputation for being a responsible and helpful student.     Additionally, buildOn, a volunteer organization that partners with Validus Preparatory Academy, often looks for Spanish  speaking members to reach out to new students as they acclimate to life in a new school setting.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    There are four different levels of Spanish that are offered to ELLs, including AP Spanish.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  As all teachers at Validus are teachers of ELL students, there are ENL based professional development sessions that cater to  teachers. At these PD sessions, many ELL strategies are discussed and reviewed so that teachers who do not specialize in ENL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73      have access to resources and ways they can differentiate instruction for ELLs. Additionally, teachers with ENL specialization  often go to NYC DOE led training sessions that have a focus. For example, teachers have gone to NYSESLAT administration PDs,  how to support ELLs through the college process, differentiation in ELL instruction, ELL techniques and strategies, etc. All  teachers are encouraged to go to at least 2 PD sessions per year outside of the ones offered at the school itself.    Non-pedagogic staff also attend professional development meetings. Administrators, paraprofessionals, and administrative  staff, and guidance counselors attend sessions that focus on anti-bullying, proper internet usage, restorative approaches to  discipline, school safety and school safety protocols.

Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Attendance is taken at the beginning of PD meetings and teachers need to sign off next to their name. The model teacher  records what teachers attend the PD offerings on a running Google document, which are all led by teachers at Validus.  Examples of PD sessions include classroom management, developing effective higher order thinking questions, incorporating  learning within the community, differentiating lesson plans for ELLs and SWDs, how to use online teaching resources, etc. The  entire list can be found below:    List of Topics to be offered in Professional Development cycle:  -Classroom Management (both APs and Dean - 10/16/2017 & 10/23/2017, 2/5/2018 & 2/12/2018)  -Lesson Planning (Spanish Teacher and Model Teacher (Science) for some, Another Model Teacher (Social Studies), ENL  Teacher, and Global History for others - 10/16/2017 & 10/23/2017, 10/30/2017 & 11/6/2017, 12/11/2017 & 12/18/2017)  -Teaching Math and SAT skills - (Math Teacher - 10/16/2017 & 10/23/2017, 12/11/2017 & 12/18/2017, 2/5/2018 & 2/12/2018)   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74         -Supporting ELLs in the Classroom (ENL Teacher - 10/16/2017 & 10/23/2017, 2/5/2018 & 2/12/2018)  -BuildOn (community service) - (BuildOn Coordinators - available for all PD cycles)  -Cross Curricular Projects and Engagement - (Model Teacher (Social Studies) - 10/30/2017 & 11/6/2017, 11/13/2017 &  11/20/2017, 3/5/2018 & 3/12/2018)  -Teaching Vocabulary (English Teacher - 11/13/2017 & 11/20/2017, 12/11/2017 & 12/18/2017)  -Effective Text Coding (Global History Teacher - 11/13/2017 & 11/20/2017, 4/23/2018 & 4/30/2018)   -Literacy (Literacy Specialist & Special Ed English Teacher - 12/11/2017 & 12/18/2017, 2/5/2018 & 2/12/2018, 4/9/2018 &  4/16/2018)  -Data Analysis (Science Teacher - 12/11/2017 & 12/18/2017, 2/5/2018 & 2/12/2018, 4/9/2018 & 4/16/2018)  -Student-Centered Classrooms (Model Teacher (Science) - 2/5/2018 & 2/12/2018)  -Special Education Strategies (AP and Special Education English Teacher - 11/13/2017 & 11/20/2017, 3/5/2018 & 3/12/2018)  -Asking Higher Order Thinking Questions (English Teacher - 2/5/2018 & 2/12/2018, 3/5/2018 & 3/12/2018)  -Teaching Struggling Readers (Literacy Specialist - 2/5/2018 & 2/12/2018, 4/23/2018 & 4/30/2018)  -Differentiation (Model Teacher (English) - 10/30/2017 & 11/6/2017, 3/5/2018 & 3/12/2018)  -Student Engagement (Model Teacher (Social Studies) - 4/9/2018 & 4/16/2018)  -Primary Source Documents (Global History Teacher - 10/30/2017 & 11/6/2017, 4/9/2018 & 4/16/2018)  -Writing Across the Curriculum (English Teacher - 4/23/2018 & 4/30/2018)  -Everything Danielson - (Special Ed History Teacher - 4/23/2018 & 4/30/2018)    Additionally, administration ensures that teachers acquire the information necessary to learn ELL-specific teaching strategies.  Teachers are sent to professional learning opportunities offered by the Bronx Field Support Center to supplement what is  offered in our in-house PD sessions.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The parental coordinator at our school doubles as the point person for Language Translation and Interpretation. When  students go through their intake upon enrolling at Validus or transferring into Validus, all parents are asked for their home  languages and what language they prefer to have used when contacted at home via phone or by mail. Parents are made aware  of the resources available to them when it comes to testing their children when they are initially matriculated. If an instance  occurs in which a language in need is not represented by any of the school staff, there is a phone number which can be used to  attain interpretation services to meet that student's needs.    One-on-one meetings with parents are scheduled during parent engagement time after school on Tuesdays from 3:15pm to  3:55pm. The ENL teacher meets with parents to schedule appointments to provide them with feedback. Also, parents have  access to PupilPath that they can access via computer or through a smart phone. Parents can monitor and check their child's  progress with grades, attendance, and behavior.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  In the past, ELL parents have participated in the Cultural Day that has taken place the past three school years. ELL parents have  also served as chaperones at school trips as well as on the SLT (School Leadership Team) meetings that take place monthly. At  this meeting, there is a school-provided translator present to accommodate the Spanish speaking parents of the school.  Additionally, there are Parent Association meetings that take place once a month and there is a translator for the Spanish  speaking parents who are present.   The college and career counselor at our school has an orientation on a Saturday morning for parents who have children that  are about to start the college process. He encourages the parents of students to attend this meeting because they need to be  aware of what is expected of the students during the process and what information the parents need to provide so the FAFSA  can be filled out properly.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75           Ms. Rosado is the designated Language Translation and Interpretation coordinator at Validus Preparatory Academy. Whenever  a translator is needed for a teacher to call a parent or for parent teacher conferences, Ms. Rosado facilitates that process and  makes the call logs. Aside from that, there are several members on the school staff that are fluent in Spanish, including  teachers, paraprofessionals, administrators, and members of the administrative staff. Apart from that, there is one teacher  who is fluent in German and Latvian and one teacher who knows French.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Christopher Hibbert, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Validus Preparatory Academy                                                                              School DBN: 09x263  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Validus Preparatory Academy reviews the home language surveys, the Learning Environment Surveys, ATS reports  ( HLIS RSSS & RHLA) and conversations with students and with parents to determine the translation needs of the  school. When parents visit the school to meet with staff, we confirm that they are receiving school materials in  their preferred language. When we call a parent at home, we work with each family to ensure that we have a staff  member who speaks the appropriate language and can translate as necessary. Data is also gathered from Part III  of the Home Language Identification Survey, Student Emergency Contact cards (Blue Card), and Skedula (a  student data maintenance service). Incoming 9th grade student information is maintained on a Google excel  document, which contains parents' language(s), student's name, cohort, and grade.    The Parent Coordinator interacts with parents and keeps forms, informational guides, and the translation number  for parent teacher conferences and Special Education (IEP) conferences to meet the language needs of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79      parents/guardians.
