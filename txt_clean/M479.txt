This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Our purpose is to promote the freedom to think, create, critique, and commit to action. Beacon promotes autonomy  and collaboration, action and reflection, connection and difference; these values help to nurture healthy,  independent, and responsible young adults.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9               2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Context: Beacon’s college preparatory program emphasizes inquiry-based learning, critical thinking, and creative  endeavor. Our liberal arts curriculum features a wide range of engaging elective courses in all academic subjects, the  arts, and technology. To graduate, each year students present performance-based assessments to panels of teachers.    The Beacon curriculum is collaboratively and originally designed by teachers keeping in mind the individual needs of  students. In professional learning groups and departments, teachers develop best practices and relevant, enriching  curricula. In classes and advisories, they study and document the individual academic progress and personal growth of  their students. Teachers collaboratively develop performance-based standards, projects, and rubrics, and rater  reliability sessions ensure equity and rigor across each subject level. The result is a thoughtful integration of skills and  content aligned to the State Common Core Standards that prepares students for the highest levels of achievement at  the collegiate level and beyond.   At Beacon, we value inquiry, multiple levels of learning, performance-based assessments, peer collaboration, and  learning as a personal experience. To us, inquiry means that all stakeholders learn by seeking the answers to deep  questions and critically analyzing sources. Students are offered multiple levels of learning in order for them to reach  for and attain levels of excellence that match their individual potential and talents. Thus, classes are heterogeneously  grouped, and all students have access to the highest levels of content and skill development. We assess students via a  well-developed system of performance-based assessments, or PBAs, in which they demonstrate their skill  development and knowledge by engaging in authentic, challenging tasks. Through the PBA process, students learn  how to organize tasks into achievable steps, to use original research to arrive at original conclusions, and to reflect on  the PBA process while being engaged in their tasks. Intrinsic to the processes of inquiry, multiple levels of learning and  performance-based assessment is the action of peer collaboration. Teachers collaborate to make meaningful  standards, assessments, and standards for evaluation. Students collaborate with teachers to understand their  expectations and receive the guidance they need to achieve their best. Students collaborate with each other to fully  appreciate the wide spectrum of opinions, abilities, and cultural backgrounds that form the foundation for each  student's learning. Finally, we believe that learning is a personal experience. One size does not fit all, and one method  does not reach everyone.    As a portfolio school, we assess prospective students through a review of their past work in an in-person interview.  Through our PBA process, we graduate students in the same way. Teachers are evaluated, in part, through the  portfolios they develop each year. These portfolios include tangible evidence of student progress and reflection on  teacher growth. Alongside the pursuit of academic achievement, students are exposed to exemplary models of social  achievement and citizenship.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Special populations: We teach a number of Students with Special Needs at Beacon, approximately 160 in 2018-19.  They are varied in their academic needs, but many share the need to improve their organizational and executive skills,  their reading and retention skills, and their writing ability.    Our emphasis on the use of multiple entry points helps us to maximize the achievement by this population. In daily  instruction, teachers provide students with many ways to access knowledge, including:    o A variety of texts with different reading levels showing contrasting perspectives,    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      o Routine use of Promethean Boards to access multi-media sources (audio and visual clips, pictures, contemporary  news articles, class plans, organizational charts, graphs, lecture notes, and class work assignments).    o Rubrics with assignments to clarify expectations.    o Homework assigned in class, also posted on the portal in two forms: a weekly assignment sheet with links to  readings, blogs and videos, and a monthly assignments sheet to help students plan.    o Assignments accessible by parents.   o Classes grouped heterogeneously;    o Scaffolded lessons designed to build higher-level skills over the course of a unit;    In addition to receiving Study Skills classes, students with disabilities and at-risk students take weekly extra class  lessons in each subject area (e.g. Algebra I Skills) for pre-teaching and extra support. Teachers spend extra one-hour  sessions pre-teaching, scaffolding, modifying and guiding their curricula for the small groups of students. Students  benefit both academically and emotionally from the added attention and the meaningful help.   Impact: Students and parents track homework on a daily basis. Students use a variety of perspectives when writing  their argument and evidence papers. Students and staff have become fluent in using a variety of technologies during  the course of a class period. Students of all levels learn from each other. All students have access to the highest levels  of learning. At-risk and SWD students receive the support they need to find success. For the past four years, 100% of  our SWDs have graduated with Regents-Level diplomas.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Last year, we made most progress in improving our rigorous instruction, creating a supportive environment,  facilitating collaboration by teachers, and establishing strong community ties.    ● Rigorous Instruction: We established an instructional focus that directly reflects our shared values- using multiple  levels of learning to promote the pursuit of excellence by each student. In professional development and in classes,  we explored how to use multiple entry points, high level questioning and discussions, and outside resources or real  world problems to reach all students.   ● Creating a supportive environment: We expanded our Study Skills program and opened it to not only Students with  Special Needs, but At-Risk students as well. We instituted refinements in the 9 th grade Bridge program and Health  and Wellness classes in order to ease the transition from junior high to high school. To heighten student interest in  learning, we created 13 new courses last year in all subject disciplines. To respond to student interest, we approved  the establishment of 11 new extra-curricular clubs.   ● Collaborative Teachers: Last year as a member of the NY Performance Standards Consortium , we continued our  involvement as a PROSE school, with an innovative Professional Development and quality review system and an  approval to launch a pilot Special Education program.    ● Strong Community Ties: We greatly expanded the number of sites that we collaborate with and take trips to.  Teachers led dozens of trips, with 75% of our students.   Next year, we plan to work to maintain our rigorous curriculum, create an even more supportive environment within  our new space, and stimulate our teachers to increase their collaborate efforts.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 03M479   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1380   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     The school has been very successful in establishing a rigorous program of instruction. Over 99 % of our students  graduate with Regents equivalency diplomas or higher (for the past three years), and our scores on the Regents  Comprehensive English Language Arts exams are consistently high, with the average score for all students in a cohort  and the number of students scoring over 85 nearly doubling over the past four years.   Our graduation rate this year will parallel the high rates achieved in past years. Our Quality Review rated as “Well  Developed” in providing engaging, rigorous, and coherent curricula in all subjects.   We graduate students according to their accumulated credits and how well they do on their performance based  assessments (PBAs), which at Beacon are administered every year in every academic subject. The scores (0-4) for the  10-12th graders determine the level of diploma for each student. In general, to earn Honors in an academic subject a  student must achieve Honors in 2 of 3 or more course levels. They must earn Honors in all academic courses, including  Language, to earn a Beacon Honors diploma. Over the years, this latter accomplishment has proven more and more  difficult to achieve for our students, as shown below. We believe that there are several factors causing this decline.  First, over the years the standards for success on PBAs have become more sophisticated and challenging. Second, we  have not made enough of an emphasis from the freshman year on to promote the achievement of an Honors  Diploma. Third, as students have ratcheted up their commitments, they have had difficulty balancing school,  homework, after-school activities, standardized test preparation, family obligations, and technology/ social media.  This year, we will continue to address these factors and help more students graduate from Beacon with Honors  Diplomas.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, we will enhance the rigor of our instruction by boosting the number of Honors Diplomas by 40%, to 12%  of the Class of 2019 our current seniors. To support our students in achieving these goals, we intend to maintain the  quality and rigor of the projects, exams, and other assessments that are a hallmark of our school.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Health and Wellness  Classes in all grades will be held to go over graduation  requirements, different levels of diplomas, student records,  schedules, and study skills to help students prepare for the PBAs.  The 9th and 10th grade seminar classes will focus on time  management techniques, proper use of social media and  technology, and establishing priorities will be addressed at these  sessions.    At the end of the year, in senior Health classes we will hold exit  interviews of graduating seniors to get their feedback on their  Beacon experience and the role of the PBAs in that experience.  The results of these interview surveys will be analyzed and  published at the beginning of the following school year. We will  use the information to better inform us about our next steps in  this 3-year process.   We will use Professional Development sessions in departments  to re-examine the standards, assessments, and rubrics of the  PBAs at each course level. Teachers will also refine their  assessment practices through departmental focus questions. In  math and science these focus questions relate to design and  implementation of high quality PBAs. In World Languages, ELA  and History these questions relate to the ways students are  giving and receiving feedback in order to master writing tasks.   We will identify students during their sophomore year who,  based upon their achievement in freshmen PBAs, show promise  in achieving Honors in individual subjects. They will be  encouraged in their individual classes to take up leadership roles  within the classroom and attend extra tutoring sessions in  advance of PBA assessments. As part of their leadership, they  will work in groups as facilitators and informal teacher helpers.    Current  sophomores  and teachers  of  sophomores,  and Special  Ed faculty.

In  addition to serving as class leaders, these latter students will  attend sessions in Study Skills classes devoted to preparing them  to maximize their achievement on the PBAs. All students with  Special Needs will have the opportunity to take Study Skills  classes designed to support them in learning the skills and  content necessary to succeed on their PBAs. In addition, special  small group sessions, taught by their classroom teachers, will  pre-teach them the content and/or review the content and skill  development taught in their academic courses.             3b – Parent and Family Engagement   How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York  State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible  for implementation and oversight.  During the 2018-19 school year, faculty and staff will facilitate workshops for parents to understand the graduation  requirements at Beacon as well as give an overview of the PBA so that families can support students in meeting the  rigorous standards set forth by our community and understand the requirements of a Beacon Honors Diploma.

The guidance and department facilitators teams will monitor progress of students toward PBA completion, including a  review of scores from the January 2018, assessment week (we expect at least 10% to be on the way toward an  Honors Diploma). By June, we hope to have at least 12% of the senior class of 2019 graduating with Honors diplomas  (or an increase of 40% over the past two years). To ensure that we are helping freshman and sophomore students  meet these PBA goals and work towards an Honors Diploma, we will help students monitor their progress during  Seminar and Skills classes.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16           Part 5b.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Beacon is a school characterized by high expectations of all members of our community, including faculty and staff  and of students and their families as well. Students feel welcome here, as evidenced by our daily attendance records,  which on a typical day is 95%+. In addition, on our most recent Quality Review Report we earned a rating of "Well  Developed" for establishing a school culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students, and  families, and provides supports to achiever those expectation. In the 2016 Framework for Great Schools Report,  however, we noticed that in the category of Supportive Environment, we scored slightly below the City-wide average  in social-emotional support (according to teachers) and a low 64 on personal attention and support (according to  students). Clearly we have room to do better.   We want our foundational level (our freshman year) to be the essential recipients of academic, emotional, and social  support, including those who come in with learning deficits.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  We will provide an enhanced, more supportive environment for freshmen transitioning to high school. Expected  outcomes: By June of 2019, our scores on the Framework for Great Schools will show a 1% (6 point) rise in Personal  Attention and Support for students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          18   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   We will teach a Health and Wellness course designed especially  for freshmen. The class will be coordinated and designed by two  members of the Guidance team. The course will have students  meet once per week in a group and once individually or in small  groups as needed with their adviser-teachers. It will follow the  mandated Health curriculum for the Department of Education,  with the expressed purpose to help students improve their  organizational skills, their ability to deal with stress and social  relationships, to prevent substance abuse, and give them  awareness of sexual issues and health risks, among other topics.  The teacher/advisers also will work to improve the  communication between academic teachers and students about  their progress. See Goal #1 for how we also will be  supplementing the curriculum with lessons designed to  acclimate students to the PBA system and help prepare them for  the assessments.   We will improve our RTI program to facilitate our response to  students in need. The ninth grade intervention plan (RTI) aims to  support student achievement by actively addressing academic  difficulties or concerns throughout the school year. The RTI  coordinator (a guidance counselor) will serve as a first point of  contact to identify students who struggle with their work; to  establish an intervention plan that directs students to the  diverse range of supports Beacon offers; and to arrange follow  up services based on the identified student’s academic needs.   Students will be identified for intervention based on the  following data sources: progress report grades/teacher  anecdotal reports, attendance data, student academic records  including PBA performance, and teacher, and/or parent referral.  Upon referral for intervention and in consultation with the  student, referring teacher, and school guidance team, the  coordinator will develop an academic support plan. Supports will  include, but not limited to, mandated small group instruction  with content area teachers, small group support labs in  Humanities and Math/Science, as well as peer tutoring and  support through the “Big Sibs” advisory program.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19   Finally, we will use high-achieving juniors and seniors who are  volunteering as peer tutors which will take place both after  school and during seminar.

Beacon is a top performing high school for many reasons, chief among them that so many of our teachers are content  specialists. Outside observers are often impressed with faculty members' expertise in their respective content areas.  However, the 2017 Framework for Great Schools Report has identified the area of Collaborative Teachers, in  particular Quality of Professional Development and Peer Collaboration, as an area in need of improvement. To  enhance the pedagogical skills of our teachers, Beacon will create a position of Department Facilitator consisting of  one teacher leader from each department. This team of teacher leaders will meet with the AP of Instruction to build  capacity to facilitate team learning and build bridges between departmental learning cycles and whole school  professional development. The work will be the foundation for the common planning time meetings of our subject- area teams. For the 2018-19 school year, the Department Facilitators will focus on developing coherent professional  learning based on individual, team, and whole school needs. In particular the use of descriptive and peer feedback to  build student ownership over their own learning (an area of need identified in the 2017-18 Quality Review Report).        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

Beacon has an impressive academic record of high achievement. Our school's' 4-year graduation rate is 99.7% and our  College Readiness Index is 91.2%. Our successes in these areas are due in part to the school's leadership and vision of  high expectations for every member of our community, including staff, teachers, students, and administrators.  However, the results of the 2017 Framework for Great Schools Report have identified Leadership as an area for  growth. To improve in this area for the 2018-19 school year, we will build capacity among faculty so that they can  share best practices and facilitate grade-level and subject-area team meetings as a means to collaborate for  horizontal and vertical alignment.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

According to the Framework for Great Schools Report, 2017, Beacon’s results within the 'Strong Family-Community  and Ties' portion fell below the citywide average in ‘Outreach to Parents’. While we have both a strongly invested  Parent Coordinator and an active PA that communicate often with the parent body, the school does not have a  standardized method of communication with the parents (e.g. weekly bulletin or newsletter, daily announcement  email). Our current website hosts announcements, and our Parent Coordinator sends email blasts, but there is no one  central location to find timely informational updates relevant to all stakeholders. Our school calendar is a reliable way  to keep current on the school’s activities; however it includes only school-wide events. For a calendar of sports and  classroom events parents must access the PSAL website or rely on individual staff communication.   In terms of academic and classroom communication, our current website hosts a parent “Homework Checker” but  does not include a centralized online grading platform. In turn, many teachers utilize individual online grading  programs and/or websites to supplement the Beacon website. For parents and students this means they must use  multiple logins to access the information hosted on the various online grading platforms and websites (e.g. – engrade,  Teacherease). Parents and students have expressed a level of frustration and impracticality with this current system,  including the lack of access to up-to-date grades, daily student performance, AND unofficial transcripts.      Despite the technical shortcomings surrounding parent communication, our bi-annual parent/adviser and  conferences are widely attended (nearly 1200 parents in the fall). During these conferences, held after 1st and 3rd  quarters, parents meet with their child’s adviser to review narrative prepared by each of his/her teachers. Together,  student, parent and adviser plot out constructive strategies to promote each student’s social, emotional and  academic growth. Additionally, each year the school hosts an extensive Curriculum Night, which includes a 10-minute  presentation from each of the student’s teachers. This year we hosted nearly 1,200 parents.      Although the school hosts such successful and well-attended school wide activities, our parent survey response rate  was only 29% this year. Historically, the school has had not been successful at communicating to parents the value of  the parent survey nor at developing a logistical process to assure greater compliance. With greater participation in the  school survey process, Beacon can better understand and respond to the expressed needs of the parents.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in our school. Therefore, our school, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between our school and the families. Our  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children.             Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   . Our school will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of our school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Our  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.      Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent  Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of our school community      In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, our school will:      ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I  Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;      ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to schools to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;      ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in our Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;      ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Our ENL teacher teaches a combination ENL classes at a school on our campus.  As part of her program, she is  freed up to teach Beacon ENL students when they are available (during Instructional Enrichment periods).  ELL students take  regular English Language Arts classes (4 days per week, 60 minutes per period, or 240 minutes) and also take one ENL class 3  days per week, 60 minutes each period, or 180 minutes of instruction.  Additional periods are added to instruction if they are  prescribed by the mandate, and this is fit into the program of the day.  Each student is regularly programmed for 6 periods of  direct instruction, one lunch and one period for of Instructional Enrichment (tutoring or additional small group instruction); it  is this period that we use for the ENL classes.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50                      The class is heterogeneous, and instruction is given through a balanced literacy model in English using themes from  the books and readings that students are assigned in their academic classes, including English Language Arts, History, and  Science.  Classes are taught by an experienced teacher licensed in ENL.  Content is given in English, and instruction is  scaffolded so that complex readings and assignments are broken down into comprehensible segments.  Additional instruction  is offered to improve vocabulary using a variety of techniques including cue cards and rhyming techniques.  Classes are  differentiated according to each student’s level of comprehensible input.  Pacing is likewise done according to student  capacity.  Newcomers are given materials to match their level of understanding, and particular attention is given to helping  them understand the expectations, procedures and standards set out by academic courses, which follow Common Core  guidelines.  ELL students are given intensive tutoring in preparation of their summative assessments (called Performance- based Assessments or PBAs at Beacon) which adhere to and exceed Common Core standards.  The results of these  assessments are analyzed by the ENL teacher and instruction and tutoring is altered so as to improve achievement over time.  Our schedule allows for students to have Instructional Enrichment periods which afford us the opportunity to serve the  students without disrupting their regular schedule. during the week than in the past.  Other than these classes, the ELL  students are mainstreamed into all academic and elective courses.  They fulfill the same requirements for graduation as all  other students.             4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?                   N/A       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. We have never had a SIFE program, as we have never had any students who qualify for this.  b. , c. and d.:  Our program for students in the country for less than three years is the same as those who have had service for  4-6 years.  Content is given in English, and instruction is scaffolded so that complex readings and assignments are broken down  into comprehensible segments.  Additional instruction is offered to improve vocabulary using a variety of techniques including  cue cards and rhyming techniques.  Classes are differentiated according to each student’s level of comprehensible  input.  Pacing is likewise done according to student capacity.  Newcomers are given materials to match their level of  understanding, and particular attention is given to helping them understand the expectations, procedures and standards set  out by academic courses, which follow Common Core guidelines.  This will be our first year teaching students who are long- term ELL (6+ years), and all three are students with IEPs.  The approach for these students will be similar to those of students  who are not long-term.  Additionally, the ENL teacher will collaboratively develop lessons with the students’ SETSS teacher to  make sure that there is continuity in their development of study skills, language comprehension, and acquisition of English  Language Arts skills. They will be given intensive tutoring in preparation of their summative assessments (called Performance- based Assessments or PBA’s at Beacon) which adhere to and excede Common Core standards.  The results of these  assessments are analyzed by the ENL teacher and instruction and tutoring is altered so as to improve achievement over time.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   We adhere to the student's IEP mandates, making sure that his or her program best supports his or her needs, academically  and emotionally. Our schedule allows for students to have enough instructional support periods during the week to fulfill State  mandates.  We are able to schedule the students for the ENL class and to receive IEP support during the day.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Other than taking their required academic classes, the ELL-SWD students are mainstreamed into all academic and elective  courses.  They fulfill the same requirements for graduation as all other students, and we anticipate all attaining Regents  Equivalency Diplomas, as all previous ELL and SWD students have done over the past 10 years.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  ELL students take regular English Language Arts classes (4 days per week, 60 minutes per period, or 240 minutes) and also take  one ENL class 3 days per week, 60 minutes each period, or 180 minutes of instruction (Advanced Students).  Additional periods  are added to instruction if they are prescribed by the mandate (Intermediate Students), and this is fit into the program of the  day.  Each student is regularly programmed for 6 periods of direct instruction, one lunch and one period for tutoring or  additional instruction; it is this period that we use for the ENL classes.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We have never before served ELL-SWD students.  Initiating collaboration between the ENL classes and the SETSS classes will be  a new initiative.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Not applicable.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our ENL program, occuring during instructional support hours, allows our ELL students to participate in all possible academic  offerings, including arts electives, science electives and physical education, while still receiving the supports that they  need.  We provide supports from both the ENL teacher and the college office (guidance counselors and an outside consultant)  to help seniors with applications to college and juniors with getting prepared for the college search.   ELL students at Beacon do very well.  They graduate (all have graduated in the past five years), they participate in after school  activities (approximately 25 different clubs), college courses, and athletics (22 PSAL, 2 non-PSAL sports), and they can and do  enroll in all the variety of academic electives.  There is no course or program in which they are prohibited from either trying  out for or participating in.  All students are encouraged to do so, and ELL students are taken by their academic advisers to an  activities fair at the beginning of each school year as part of this effort.  ELL students also can take any foreign language offered  at Beacon (Spanish) or apply to take foreign languages offered at colleges associated with Beacon (Fordham, John Jay, Hunter,  or NYU).       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructionally, all ELL students have access to computers in a computer lab or library all day long.  ELL-SWD students also have  access to computers in their SETSS room, 421. In addition, they have access to the Beacon portal, on which they can survey a  plethora of resources, including their course schedule and syllabi, their daily homework assignments, their PBA scores, all  after-school activities, and other pertinent academic information.  The ENL class is delivered in a room with computers, so that  students can access and work on homework and other assignments, according to the class plan.  Additional content materials  are available in the Library, and the catalog is available to students on-line.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Our targeted intervention programs for ELLs are in ELA, math, and science under the ENL model.  We do not deliver TBE or  Dual Language programs at our school.  ENL  includes intensive small group and individual tutoring by classroom teachers in  preparation for the ELA (11th grade), additional support and counseling by the ENL teacher in preparation for the Math,  Science and History PBA’s, academic advisement by each student’s adviser (meeting 1 time per week for 45 minutes) and by  guidance counselors on an as-needed basis.  Native language support is delivered by using translators to help with difficult  vocabulary, and translation materials and interpretation services offered to families.  Preparation for the NYSELAT exam is  given by the ENL teacher in advance of the test, and vocabulary/ Native Language support is a key part of this  preparation.  Students who pass the NYSELAT continue to receive transitional support from both the ENL teacher and their  academic adviser.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All our current ELLs are in the same grade, 9        th       grade.  All 9        th       graders learn the same curriculum in Math,  Science, English Language Arts and Social Studies.  We hold professional development sessions in which teachers of the same  subject and course level collaborate to create curriculum, assessments, and projects ideas, as well as check standards, rubrics,  and student feedback.  Our ENL classes use the same books, readings, and assignments as the resources for instruction, so to  provide continuity of instruction to the students.  Also, the ENL and SETSS teachers coordinate the teaching of skills in their  respective classes.  Administrators check in on all these meetings, receive minutes, and when there seems to be an issue, give  direct advice to the teachers on how to modify instruction or better accommodate the needs of the ELL students.  The Special  Education Coordinator makes sure that all ELL students receive their mandated accommodations for assessments.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Instructionally, all ELL students have access to computers in a computer lab or library all day long.  ELL-SWD students also have  access to computers in their SETSS room, 421. In addition, they have access to the Beacon portal, on which they can survey a  plethora of resources, including their course schedule and syllabi, their daily homework assignments, their PBA scores, all  after-school activities, and other pertinent academic information.  The ENL class is delivered in a room with computers, so that  students can access and work on homework and other assignments, according to the class plan.  Additional content materials  are available in the Library, and the catalog is available to students on-line.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   For new ELLs who enroll during the school year, we offer a Health/Wellness class once a week, in which a small group of  students under the guidance of a teacher discuss various issues related to school.  Included in these topics are programming  issues, organizing strategies, social acclimation tactics, using technology and the Beacon portal, and expectations for  success.  Students new to the school are assigned a "buddy" from this advisory class to help them further get acclimated to the  school.  Each student is given a LAB test within the first 10 days of enrolling, to determine whether or not they need ELL  services.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish, French, and available college courses at Fordham University.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  At Beacon, our ENL teachers participate in professional learning groups and course-level departmental meetings for 9         th       Grade which meet twice per week during the week for one hour throughout the year (meeting approximately 60 hours  per year).  In these sessions, teachers focus on issues of literacy:  how to better their teaching of literacy, how to better  integrate the teaching of literacy throughout every discipline, and how to best respond to the individual needs of each  student.  This year we specifically are targeting the ability of students to use argument and evidence in their writing as part of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         an effort to address a challenging Common Core Learning Standard.  These sessions will focus on the utility of initial evaluative  assessments, the utility of lesson plans, the effectiveness of anecdotal narratives (student/parent feedback), techniques for  teaching argument and evidence, developing effective end-of-term assessments, creating supportive classroom environments,  and monitoring effective group activities in the classroom, among others.  The ENL teachers also are encouraged and do  participate in DOE sponsored professional development sessions given throughout the year, especially on Chancellor  Conference Days.    Our ENL teachers assist in developing agendas and strategies for success at these meetings; they are key parts to the teams of  approximately 5 teachers who work directly with the Principal to improve instruction (30 hours/ year).  In addition, one of our  ENL teachers participates in the Summer Bridge program, in which the great majority of incoming 9th graders come for one  day for orientation, acclimation, and evaluation activities.  At our monthly faculty meetings, we hold two sessions to  specifically address the needs of individual students, especially in preparation for the ELA and performance-based assessments  (2 hours total).   These assessments directly evaluate students' mastery of Common Core skills, and we the sessions are  designed to improve student preparation, teacher assessment/ feedback, and rater reliability.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  We hold a summer bridge program for all students in the 9        th       grade, or other students new to the school.  One of our  ENL teachers helps instruct during the Summer Bridge program, in which the great majority of incoming 9th graders come for  one day for orientation, acclimation, and evaluation activities.  The afternoon session of the Bridge is devoted to incoming  Special Education and ELL students, in order to better identify their abilities and needs, and to introduce them to the standards  and expectations of the school.  The activities are designed to make the students comfortable and confident in their new  setting.  Additionally, our lead Guidance Counselor attends DOE-sponsored Professional Development regarding translation/  interpretation support and social/ emotional support to students in transition to high school who are ELL's (2 hours per year).  She then walks the other counselors through this material at subsequent staff meetings at the school.  The Parent Coordinator  and Guidance counselors are helped by the lead Counselor and Administrators in being instructed about the admissions  process, as well as ongoing support to families of ELL students.     Of the 60 weekly professional development meetings, 9 sessions are devoted to developing co-teaching strategies between  ENL, Special Needs and general education teachers.  In these sessions, teachers work on integrating language and content  instruction for English language learners into the regular general education curriculum.  They also focus on building strong  language foundations in the ENL and SETSS classes as the students approach performance-based assessment tasks.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   This year, our students are ELL-SWD.  Each family attends an IEP meeting (an annual review, a triennial, or a reevaluation)  which is attended by both the SETSS teacher and the ENL teacher and discusses the progress and needs of the child.  In  addition, the parents are invited to attend meetings with teachers on an as needed basis, especially when academic issues  arise.        2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents of ELLs participate in twice yearly parent-teacher conferences, in after-school college information nights (4 times for  Juniors- seniors), in Parent Association meetings, and in individual meetings with guidance counselors or advisers (on an as- needed basis).  We use outside vendors at least once a year to inform parents about opportunities for SAT/ ACT prep classes  (Princeton Review and Revolution Prep, among others) and about the college process (various representatives from local  universities).  We address the needs of our ELL parents on an as-needed basis.  The Parent Coordinator sends out a weekly   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         announcement by email to the parents that updates them about the activities in the school.  The academic adviser also  communicates information specific to the student as issues come up. When appropriate, parents are called in by the adviser  and/ or guidance counselor to assist with family issues or to address concerns about our ELL students.        Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Ruth Lacey, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Beacon High School determines the primary Language spoken by: [1] for parents of students entering Beacon  from another NYC public school by reviewing various ATS reports [such as RESI, RHLA, etc.] as well as other DOE  documentation such as Emergency Contact Card Information; [2] for parents of students who are entering Beacon  High School from Private or another city, we review any records obtained from the entering student’s former  school; [3] when a student enters Beacon High School, parents are given by hand a Home Language Identification  Survey for them to complete, and our records [via ATS - UPPG] are updated with the information we receive.  Home Language surveys are kept on file and placed in the student’s cumulative record folder.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

At the beginning of each school year, Beacon sends home via students a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and  Responsibilities. This includes information for parents whose primary language is a covered language and who require  language assistance services their rights regarding translation and interpretation services. Translated versions of this  document are made available in the covered languages through    http://schools.nyc.gov/RulesPolicies/ParentBillofRights/Parents+Bill+of+Rights+and+Responsiblities.htm.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Each Spring, we disseminate the DOE School Surveys to parents in a variety of home languages. We then analyze the  results of these surveys, focusing on the communications questions and the parents' views of the quality and  availability of translation and interpretation services. During Parent-teacher conferences in the Spring, we also have  the advisers ask parents about their experiences with communication in the school during their 15 minute meetings.  The advisers then report back to the administration about the parents' feedback.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62
