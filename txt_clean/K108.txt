This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Vision and Mission: The vision of P.S.108K is to collaboratively educate the whole child- intellectually, physically,  emotionally, and socially, so they become a life-long learner, who is a productive, civic-minded member of society  as they fulfill the role of our future leaders.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      P.S.108K's school community is committed to the academic and social/emotional success of every child so that they  are prepared to be college and career ready for the 21st century. We will accomplish this collaboratively with  students, parents, guardians and teachers by:   ▶ working together with data-driven, shared goals to ensure that students make progress each year.   ▶ empowering every member to share the responsibility of student outcomes and value life-long learning.   ▶ providing the resources and support necessary to ensure that teachers, staff, parents, guardians, and students  embrace the common core learning standards despite obstacles and challenges they may encounter on the  journey.   ▶ persevering and developing growth mindset that will empower our students to be the effective, future leaders.     2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P.S. 108K is a Pre-K through 5 th grade elementary school in the Cypress Hills/East New York Section of Brooklyn.    Our instructional focus ensures that our students are held accountable to be active participants in their learning and  not become dependent observers. It holds our teachers accountable to provide our students with strategies to be the  hardest workers in the classroom, instead of bystanders whose teachers’ read, write and think for them because the  work is challenging.       Instructional Focus: Evidence in Argument: Students will develop the skills to use evidence to support arguments in  discussion which will then transfer to stronger writing in literacy and math and develop the communication and  collaboration skills that support college and career readiness.      This philosophy resonates in our vision and mission for the P.S. 108K school community. It was collaboratively  designed by parents, teachers and school leaders.       With students, parents, guardians and teachers working together with shared goals, we can ensure that students  make progress each year and graduate from school prepared to succeed by being college and career ready.   P.S. 108K is partnered with East New York Reads Literacy Initiative. This partnership has led to the following school- based programs:     City Year New York   We also have an affiliation with Cypress Hills Organization to support the Ready Readers Program for Second Graders  through a grant.   We have a partnership with the St. John's University Student Teacher Program.

Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   19K 108 has English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities subgroups on each grade level.    In literacy, students with disabilities typically struggle in reading grade-level text due to text complexity and rich  vocabulary. Some struggle with decoding and retaining sight-word vocabulary. Those who have stronger word-attack  strategies struggle with applying comprehension strategies in order to make meaning from text. Additionally, making  claims and defending claims using text-based evidence may be a challenge.    English Language Learners have specific needs regarding language development, both orally and written, as well as  vocabulary development. Additionally, many Newcomers do not have a strong foundation in their native language,  which is a barrier to becoming strong in language 2--English.       In mathematics, English Language Learners do not have the basic foundational concepts that are required to have  access to grade level standards. Newcomers typically do not attend school as it is structured in the United States and  thus have not been exposed to the grade-level curriculum.    Students with disabilities have difficulty solving multi-step word problems and are unable to determine which  operation to use. Students tend to circle numbers in a word problem and then randomly choose an operation to solve  without deep understanding of what the word problem is asking them to do. Both subgroups struggle with  mathematical fluency.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Most progress: Rigorous instruction, supportive environment, collaborative teachers and effective school leadership.  Our progress in the percentage of students making promotional criteria according to the 2018 NYS ELA and NYS  Mathematics Assessment is a reflection of our level of rigorous instruction.    Based on the 2018 NYS ELA Met and Not Met Promotional Criteria, we have made progress.      93% of students in grades 3, 4, and 5 met promotional criteria as compared to 87% in 2017.     85% of Students with Disabilities met promotional criteria as compared to 70% in 2017.     76% of English Language Learners met promotional criteria as compared to 57% in 2017.    Based on the 2018 Mathematics Assessment Met and Not Met Promotional Criteria, we have made progress.      93% of students in grades 3, 4 and 5 met promotional criteria as compared to 89% in 2017.    91% of Students with Disabilities met promotional criteria as compared to 85% in 2017.    75% of English Language Learners met promotional criteria as compared to 69% in 2017.    Area of Focus: Strong Family Community Ties: Families are invited to participate in their children's classrooms, attend  events/activities. However, some families do not take advantage of the opportunities, so Parent Coordinator, social  workers, guidance counselor, Director of Student Services, teachers, and administration will seek other ways to  motivate families to attend such as use of raffles, parent/guardian activities and other incentives.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 19K108   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   959   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

P.S. 108K conducted a comprehensive assessment of our school’s academic program in response to the Framework  for Great Schools-Rigorous Instruction. This assessment was conducted by analyzing student performance trends,  reviewing findings from our Quality Review (QR) and utilizing other relevant data.   Based on the 2017 New York State ELA results:      47.7% of our 3rd grade students scored at a Level 3 or 4 on the New York State (NYS) English Language Arts   (ELA) Assessment, which is a 10% increase from 2015-16 SY.      46.8% of our 4th grade students scored at Level 3 or 4 on the NYS ELA Assessment, which is a 7.1% increase   from the 2015-16 SY.      49.0% of our 5th grade students scored at a Level 3 or 4 on the NYS ELA Assessment, which is a 7.3% decrease   from the 2015-16 SY.      Overall, grades 3, 4 and 5 increased levels 3 and 4 by 3.7%.     47.9% of our students achieved a level 3 or 4 on the NYS ELA Assessment, as compared to 40.6% of students   city-wide and 39.8% of the students state-wide and 36.9% district wide.      The percentage of ELL students that scored at levels 3 and 4 on the 2016-2017 New York State ELA   Assessment is 5.1% which is a 5.7% decrease.      The percentage of SWD students that scored at levels 3 and 4 on the 2016-2017 New York State ELA   Assessment is 22.3%, which is an 8.0% increase.    Based on the 2017 New York State Mathematics results:      45.5% of our third grade students scored at Levels 3 or 4, which is 19.5% increase from the 2016 results.     43.9% of our fourth grade students scored at Levels 3 or 4, which is a 0.2% increase     44.1% of our fifth grade students scored at Levels 3 or 4, which is a 14.4% decrease from 2016.     Overall, the level of 3s and 4s increased by 1.8% from 2016 to 2017 for students in grades 3, 4 and 5, as   measured by the NYS Mathematics Assessment.    Based on the 2018 NYS ELA Met and Not Met Promotional Criteria, we have made progress.      93% of students in grades 3, 4, and 5 met promotional criteria.     85% of Students with Disabilities met promotional criteria.     76% of English Language Learners met promotional criteria.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14      Based on the 2018 Mathematics Assessment Met and Not Met Promotional Criteria, we have made progress.      93% of students in grades 3, 4 and 5 met promotional criteria.     91% of Students with Disabilities met promotional criteria.    75% of English Language Learners met promotional criteria.      Upon analysis, the majority of English Language Learners who did not meet promotional criteria in math have  been in the United States for less than a year. Many of these students did not attend school as structured in  the U.S. Thus, even though these students take the assessment in their Native Language, they lack the grade- level math skills in order to access grade-level content.    Our schools strengths and needs are as follows:      Strengths :      According to the 2014-15 Quality Review, P.S. 108K’s "curricula ensures challenging tasks and rigorous habits   for all students are aligned to Common Core Learning Standards and/or content standards and strategically  integrate the instructional shifts. Curricula and academic tasks are planned and refined using student work  and data."      P.S. 108K has developed coherency in the curriculum maps using a careful blending of Engage NY texts, other   rich, complex texts and/or selected texts from Ready Gen that strategically integrate the instructional shifts  across grade bands, K-2 and 3-5. After an in depth-analysis of student work, pre-assessments, running records  and summative data, teacher teams made revisions of writing prompts to support the writing process across  subjects. Curriculum maps were adjusted to reflect alignment to Common Core Learning Standards, teaching  points, questions and assessments and included differentiation for SWDs and ELLs. Lesson plans reflect  integration of higher-order questions using Depth of Knowledge and Hess Matrix.  Strong teacher collaboration has resulted in lesson studies and instructional rounds on how to address gaps in  learning for all students in literacy and mathematics.        According to the 2014-15 Quality Review, "a positive school culture that supports all members is maintained   as leadership communicates excellence in instruction and communicates high expectations. Families are  partners and are kept abreast of student progress on a consistent basis.   Priority Needs:     We also have a diverse staff. Many of our teachers consistently receive Effective and Highly Effective ratings.  However, we also have non-tenured teachers, many of whom are 1st or 2nd year teachers. Many of the new  and non-tenured teachers are in grades K-2. To meet the needs of teachers with such a wide variety of  pedagogical skills, we have developed a very comprehensive professional learning program, which includes  the support of staff developers/mentors.      To build the early literacy skills of our K-2 students.     To develop a deep understanding of the math progressions, mathematical practices, the 5 practices of   mathematics and shifts in mathematics      To improve mathematical fluency in all grades    To continue to provide professional-learning opportunities pertaining to Specially Designed Instruction for   SWDs.      To expand Specially Designed Instruction for English Language Learners.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   Goal 1: Rigorous Instruction:    By June 2019, levels 2, 3 and 4 will increase by 10% for all students in ELA and Mathematics, including SWDs and ELLs, as  measured by Fountas and Pinnell, Lexile and Mathematics’ Post Assessment scores collectively.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible  for implementation and oversight.  P.S. 108K will engage families through workshops and Family Fridays to support their understanding of Rigorous  Instruction and the Common Core, in order to support their children at home. In an effort to increase parent  involvement and engagement in the area of providing and promoting rigorous instruction, we ensure that the Title I  funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as described in our Parent  Involvement Policy and the School Parent Compact.    We will provide training/workshops in English and Spanish to help parents work with their children to improve their  achievement level, e.g., literacy, and math, understand city, state and federal standards and assessments and share  information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          21         We will utilize the Tuesday Parent Engagement block to reach out to parents and guardians to meet face to face for  the parents/guardians, with individual or groups of parents or guardians, conduct telephone conversations,  correspond with parents or guardians in writing through letters, emails, and/or grade level newsletters. This provides  the school staff to share information about student progress, the school’s educational program and other initiatives of  the Chancellor. We provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., CCLS  assessment expectations, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report and allow parents to provide suggestions during PTA and School  Leadership Meetings.

Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for  implementation and oversight.  P.S. 108K engages families to support their understanding of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive  Environment in order to assist their children at home.   In an effort to increase parent involvement and engagement in the area of providing and promoting a supportive  environment, we ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities  and strategies as described in our Parent Involvement Policy and the School Parent Compact.       We provide parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children and foster a caring and effective home-school  partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor their child’s progress.      We utilize the Tuesday Parent Engagement block to reach out to parents and guardians to meet face to face with  individual or groups of parents or guardians, conduct telephone conversations, correspond with parents or guardians  in writing through letters, emails, and/or grade level newsletters. This provides the school staff to share information  about student progress, the school's educational program, the child's social-emotional well-being and other initiatives  of the Chancellor.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Parents or guardians are invited to grade performances, student performances in plays etc., award ceremonies and  filed trips in order to celebrate the child's accomplishments and social-emotional growth. We also distribute awards  for recognition of Student-of-the-Month and Athlete-of-the-Month during PTA meetings to increase attendance.       All parents/guardians will be invited into the classroom on a monthly basis during Family Fridays or during Tuesday  afternoon clubs to provide parents an opportunity to actively participate in their child’s classroom and see the  common core in action.    We provide training/workshops in English and Spanish to help parents work with their children by giving them  strategies and coping mechanisms to use when confronted with stressful situations. These workshops are also used to  share information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities.               Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment  Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.     Our budget reflects our philosophy that professional learning drives effective instruction. We have budgeted for 2  UFTTC staff developers who provide job-embedded professional learning including CTLE hours, demonstration  lessons, lesson planning, data analysis, inter-visitations, lesson studies and mentoring for all teachers to improve  teacher practice and student performance. We budget one technology coordinator, and one Response To  Intervention (RTI) coordinator that supports the data process and RTI. These professional learning opportunities  promote differentiation of instruction and identifying multiple entry points to ensure the needs of all learners are  met. Our budget is also adjusted to provide opportunities for staff and administrators to attend network conferences,  citywide and state conferences, such as Everyone Reads and Engage NY Network Team Institute (NTI.)    Three teachers on staff were trained in PBIS and will be implementing PS 108K ROCKS school wide to promote school  rules as well as social and emotional self monitoring.   We make additional budgetary decisions to include programs such as Extended Day and Saturday Academy to provide  at-risk students in grades 1-5 opportunities to increase student achievement.   We also will be using per session funds to enable teachers to collaboratively plan curriculum maps and lesson study  for the 2018-19 school year. Our schedules allow for weekly common preps for teachers at all grade levels and  subject areas. Teachers use these common preps to attend professional learning sessions based on student data,  student work analysis, and trends found from informal and formal observations.    Budgetary funds are used to purchase guided reading books A - Z in both fiction and non-fiction to address the  instructional shifts and the HMH Read 180/System 44, iRead to support literacy at the students’ current levels.  Budgetary funds are also used to purchase Math180, Do the Math, FASTT math, Eureka Math Modules to support all  types of learners.

Based on the 2017 New York State ELA results:      47.7% of our 3rd grade students scored at a Level 3 or 4 on the New York State (NYS) English Language Arts   (ELA) Assessment, which is a 10% increase from 2015-16 SY.      46.8% of our 4th grade students scored at Level 3 or 4 on the NYS ELA Assessment, which is a 7.1% increase   from the 2015-16 SY.      49.0% of our 5th grade students scored at a Level 3 or 4 on the NYS ELA Assessment, which is a 7.3% decrease   from the 2015-16 SY.      Overall, grades 3, 4 and 5 increased levels 3 and 4 by 3.7%.     47.9% of our students achieved a level 3 or 4 on the NYS ELA Assessment, as compared to 40.6% of students   city-wide and 39.8% of the students state-wide and 36.9% district wide.      The percentage of ELL students that scored at levels 3 and 4 on the 2016-2017 New York State ELA   Assessment is 5.1% which is a 5.7% decrease.      The percentage of SWD students that scored at levels 3 and 4 on the 2016-2017 New York State ELA   Assessment is 22.3%, which is an 8.0% increase.    Based on the 2017 New York State Mathematics results:      45.5% of our third grade students scored at Levels 3 or 4, which is 19.5% increase from the 2016 results.     43.9% of our fourth grade students scored at Levels 3 or 4, which is a 0.2% increase     44.1% of our fifth grade students scored at Levels 3 or 4, which is a 14.4% decrease from 2016.     Overall, the level of 3s and 4s increased by 1.8% from 2016 to 2017 for students in grades 3, 4 and 5, as   measured by the NYS Mathematics Assessment.    Based on the 2018 NYS ELA Met and Not Met Promotional Criteria, we have made progress.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39        93% of students in grades 3, 4, and 5 met promotional criteria.     85% of Students with Disabilities met promotional criteria     76% of English Language Learners met promotional criteria.    Based on the 2018 Mathematics Assessment Met and Not Met Promotional Criteria, we have made progress.      93% of students in grades 3, 4 and 5 met promotional criteria.     91% of Students with Disabilities met promotional criteria     75% of English Language Learners met promotional criteria.      Upon analysis, the majority of English Language Learners who did not meet promotional criteria in math have  been in the United States for less than a year. Many of these students did not attend school as structured in  the U.S. Thus, even though these students take the assessment in their Native Language, they lack the grade- level math skills in order to access grade-level content.    Our schools strengths and needs are as follows:   ● Strengths: According to the 2014-15 Quality Review, all P.S. 108K teachers participate in multiple structured  professional learning venues that focus on strengthened teacher pedagogical capacity and continuous student  improvement via implementation of Common Core Learning Standards and instructional shifts. Teacher leaders  facilitate vertical and horizontal team meetings on a consistent basis that focus on the attainment of school goals and  promote increased student achievement.   All teachers meet in vertical and horizontal teams using an inquiry approach to improve classroom practice. The Dual  Language (DL) teacher team reviewed student writing and initiated adjustments to instructional practice using the  ENL Writing Progressions and Universal Design for Learning (UDL) approach. The SWD Teacher Team sets goals in ELA  and mathematics based upon the gaps between the general education and students with disabilities based on data  from the NYS ELA and mathematics using the item analysis tool.       Teacher teams utilize various protocols for “looking at student work” and all teachers select and follow roles during  the team meetings. The analysis of student work includes pre-assessment, desired student thinking, what students  need to know, implications for instruction and post-assessments. Based on data analysis, teachers discuss the gaps in  student learning and implications for instruction for each level of students. For example, embedding Do The Math!  fluency (which incorporates math games, whiteboard technology and manipulatives) lessons to support fluency in  grades K-3 based upon the analysis of fluency data.   All teachers engage in professional learning through lesson study or instructional rounds. The lessons initiate from  data and the instructional practices identified as crucial to student progress during the inquiry cycles. Teachers select  a focus based on data and then research the topic identified as area of need for the lesson study. Lessons are  developed collaboratively and are taught, observed, analyzed, rewritten and re-taught. In a fourth grade lesson study,  teachers found a problem of practice was the current 4th grade students demonstrated a gap in understanding of  non-fiction due to the lack of prior knowledge on a subject area but if they analyzed the photographs before reading it  would activate their schema. Teachers researched the Synectics Model to aide in comprehension of non-fiction texts.  Teachers commented that lesson study allowed colleagues to identify and employ specific instructional strategies that  meet the needs of all learners. They will continue to use this strategy to access non-fiction texts next year.   ● Priority Needs: PS 108K has a diverse group of teachers, ranging from new (non tenured), transferring from  struggling schools, and with TIPS through highly effective and effective. In an attempt to close the gap in student  learning, teacher effectiveness and pedagogical skills, so that all teachers can contribute equally when collaborating  and planning, we will provide differentiated professional learning opportunities to build the capacity of teachers.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

Lesson Study-         Lesson study is a professional development process in  which teachers jointly plan, observe, analyze and refine  classroom lessons facilitated by a staff developer and  overseen by an administrator. The main objective of a  lesson study is to collaboratively improve practice and  student achievement. The focus of a lesson study is on  the instructional strategies that are implemented in a  classroom and how they support student learning.  Teachers carefully analyzing how students respond to a  lesson, focusing on student learning and engagement.  Lesson study provides the opportunity for a group of  teachers to deeply examine their practice to increase  student achievement by jointly planning a single lesson  around a selected instructional strategy based on data  and student work analysis. As part of the process, a team  member teaches the lesson while colleagues observe  and take notes. The team then reflects on and refines  the lesson together, before repeating the cycle using the  revised lesson plan with another teacher's class. Using  protocol teachers discuss how effectively the lesson  supported each teacher’s students, the team examines  how they can revise and incorporate the strategy into  daily practices to maximize student learning.

Re-teaching, revising and reflecting      Instructional Rounds:      “Instructional rounds are a disciplined way for educators  to work together to improve instruction” (City, Elmore,  Fiarman, & Teitel, 2009). The practice combines three  common elements of improvement: classroom  observation, an improvement strategy, and a network of  educators. Educators adapt rounds to their purpose and  context based on student data and analysis of student  work.        The practice looks the same and relies heavily on   protocol: a group of colleagues will meet together over  time following protocol, they define a problem of  practice, and research an improvement strategy; you  collaboratively create a mini lesson; you visit classrooms  in small groups; you debrief after the observation; you  identify next levels of work and build the group’s  relevant knowledge and skills; and you repeat this  process which is facilitated by a staff developer and  overseen by an administrators.

Systems and Structures:   Teacher teams will systematically analyze key elements of  teacher work including classroom practice, assessment data, and  student work, resulting in shared improvements in teacher  practice and mastery of goals for groups of students. Teams of  teachers will meet several times a week. P.S. 108K will conduct  grade-wide teacher teams, science teacher teams, the arts  teacher team, and physical education (P.E.) teacher team and  ELL Teacher Team. These teams will engage in inquiry-based  structure, professional collaborations, such as lesson study, that  have strengthened teacher instructional capacity and promoted  the implementation of CCLS, resulting in school-wide  instructional coherence and increased student achievement for  all learners. Students With Disabilities (SWD) teacher teams and  English Language Learners (ELL) teacher teams will meet with  upper grades and lower grades bi-weekly.      Distributed leadership structures will be embedded so that there  is effective teacher leadership by lead teachers and staff  developers with the teachers playing an integral role in key  decisions and lesson plannning that affect student learning  across the school. Members of the School Leadership Team (SLT)  teacher leaders, members of the Professional Learning  Committee, the school consultation team, and members of the  Measures of Student Learning (MOSL) committee are key staff  members who will turn-key and /or provide professional learning  opportunities to the staff. Teacher leaders will be the facilitators  of their specific teacher teams. These teachers will set the  agendas for their teams. Roles and responsibilities are assigned  to other teachers on the teams.      Our teams of teachers will meet regularly to reflect and revise  curriculum maps, which are aligned with the CCLS, analyze  student work in order to identify current student thinking vs.  desired student thinking, and then design units / lessons that  include Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and differentiation  for groups of students to meet the needs of all students,  including above grade level. These teams of teachers will work                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      collaboratively by grade and share vertically.

The P.S. 108K School Community aligns assessments to curricula,  uses on-going assessment and grading practices, and teams of  teachers analyze information on student learning outcomes to  adjust instructional decisions at the team and classroom levels.  The assessments, rubrics, and grading policies are aligned with  school’s curricula and offer a clear portrait of student mastery.  Teachers provide kid-friendly rubrics to provide students an  opportunity to self-reflect and to receive feedback from peers.  Teachers check in on understanding throughout a lesson.  Teachers are able to provide actionable and meaningful  feedback to students and teachers regarding student  achievement. These common assessments create a portrait of  students’ strengths, next learning steps and progress towards  meeting their grade-wide standards. SWD and ELL students are  provided scaffolds to support the use of rubrics, checklists,  setting and reflecting on goals etc.         We use formative assessments/multiple sources of data so we  can monitor and revise instruction to meet the needs of all  students, including SWDs and ELLs. Teams of teachers, the (SWD  and ELL teams meet bi-weekly), meet regularly to analyze these  multiple sources of data, such as, but not limited to, Fountas and  Pinnell levels, SRI/SPI Lexile scores, math benchmarks, writing   All students  including  ELLs, SWDs,  SIFE  students, and  over age  students                                    September  2018- June  2019                                          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      benchmarks, and informal and formal observations.

While collaboratively creating lessons as a team UDL for the  lesson and differentiation (and SDI) for SWD and ELL students is  embedded into the lesson. Teachers record notices for each  subgroup of students, such as ELLs, SWDs and high achievers to  evaluate if the instruction meets the needs of all learners.  Teachers focus on these students and scaffolds while the lesson  is being implemented to ensure they are supporting the  students. During the debrief this is discussed and collaboratively  revised based on the observations.

Include the timeline and  identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight.  P.S. 108K engages families to support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and the Common Core, in order to  support their children at home. In an effort to increase parent involvement and engagement in the area of providing  and promoting rigorous instruction, we ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to  implement activities and strategies as described in our Parent Involvement Policy and the School Parent Compact.    We provide parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children and foster a caring and effective home-school  partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor their child’s progress.   Our School Leadership Team (that supports school-based decision making and helps to shape the path to a  collaborative school culture) consists of an equal number of staff and parents. They meet regularly and are  collaboratively involved in writing the CEP, making school based decisions, and sharing their opinions and/or  concerns.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      We utilize the Tuesday Parent Engagement block to reach out to parents and guardians to meet face to face with  individual or groups of parents or guardians, conduct telephone conversations, correspond with parents or guardians  in writing through letters, emails, and/or grade level newsletters. This enables the school staff to share information  about student progress, the school ’ s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor.      We provide opportunities for parents to explain the accountability system, e.g., Common Core Learning Standards  (CCLS) assessment expectations, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality  Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report and allow parents to provide suggestions during Parent Teacher  Association (PTA) and School Leadership Meetings.   All parents/guardians are invited into the classroom on a monthly basis during Family Fridays to provide parents an  opportunity to actively participate in their child’s school learning environment.   We also distribute awards for recognition of Student-of-the-Month and Athlete-of-the-Month during PTA meetings to  increase attendance.    Our dance teachers create original performances for our students to perform during PTA meetings at least three  times a year which also increases parental attendance. Our PE team will be providing workshops on fitness for the  parents/guardians at least 3 times a year and a monthly newsletter will be sent home to promote physical activity,  health and nutrition.    We provide training/workshops in English and Spanish to help parents work with their children to improve their  achievement level. This training includes workshops in literacy, and math, workshops to help parents understand city,  state, and federal standards and assessments and to share information about school and parent related programs,  meetings and other activities.            Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment   Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.     Our budget reflects our philosophy that professional learning drives effective instruction. We have budgeted for 2  UFTTC staff developers who provide job-embedded professional learning, demonstration lessons, lesson planning,  data analysis, inter-visitations, lesson studies and mentoring for all teachers to improve teacher practice and student  performance. We budget one technology coordinator, and one Response To Intervention (RTI) coordinator thta  support the data process and RTI. We have also hired an outside consultant to provide professional development in  literacy to all pedagogical staff. These professional learning opportunities promote differentiation of instruction and  identifying multiple entry points to ensure the needs of all learners are met. Our budget is also adjusted to provide  opportunities for staff and administrators to attend network conferences, citywide and state conferences, such as  Everyone Reads and Engage NY Network Team Institute (NTI.)    We make additional budgetary decisions to include programs such as, Extended Day and Saturday Academy to  provide at-risk students in grades 1-5 opportunities to increase student achievement.   We also will be using per session funds to enable teachers to collaboratively plan curriculum maps and units of study  for the 2018-19 school year. Our schedules allow for weekly common preps for teachers at all grade levels and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      subject areas. Teachers use these common preps to attend professional learning sessions based on student data,  student work analysis, and trends found from informal and formal observations.    Budgetary funds are used to purchase guided reading books A - Z in both fiction and non-fiction to address the  instructional shifts and the HMH Read 180/System 44, iRead to support literacy at the students’ current levels.  Budgetary funds are also used to purchase Math180, FASTT math to support all types of learners.

Include  the  timeline and identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight.  P.S. 108K engages families to support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and the Common Core, in order to  support their children at home. In an effort to increase parent involvement and engagement in the area of providing  and promoting rigorous instruction, we ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to  implement activities and strategies as described in our Parent Involvement Policy and the School Parent Compact. We  provide parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children and foster a caring and effective home-school partnership to  ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor their child’s progress.      We utilize the Tuesday Parent Engagement block to reach out to parents and guardians to meet face to face with  individual or groups of parents or guardians, conduct telephone conversations, correspond with parents or guardians  in writing through letters, emails, and/or grade level newsletters. This enables the school staff to share information  about student progress, the school's educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor. Additionally, we  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., Common Core Learning  Standards (CCLS) assessment expectations, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report,  Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report and allow parents to provide suggestions during Parent  Teacher Association (PTA) and School Leadership Meetings.      All parents/guardians are invited into the classroom on a monthly basis during Family Fridays to provide parents an  opportunity to actively participate in their child’s school learning environment. We also distribute awards for  recognition of Student-of-the-Month and Athlete-of-the-Month during PTA meetings to increase attendance.

We provide training/workshops in English and Spanish to help parents work with their children to improve their  achievement level. This training includes workshops in literacy, and math, workshops to help parents understand city,  state, and federal standards and assessments and to share information about school and parent related programs,  meetings and other activities. P.S. 108K currently has a partnership with Literacy INC. (LINC): LINC developed its  Comprehensive Literacy Model based on research showing that mobilizing three key constituency groups—peers,  parents, and community members with an intended goal to impact on early childhood literacy development.           Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment  Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.     Our budget reflects our philosophy that professional learning drives effective instruction. We have budgeted for 3  staff developers who provide job-embedded professional learning, demonstration lessons, lesson planning, data  analysis, inter-visitations, lesson studies and mentoring for all teachers to improve teacher practice and student  performance. We budget one technology coordinator, and one Response To Intervention (RTI) coordinator thta  support the data process and RTI. We have also hired an outside consultant to provide professional development in  literacy to all pedagogical staff and TEQ to enhance our use of technology as an instructional tool. These professional  learning opportunities promote differentiation of instruction and identifying multiple entry points to ensure the  needs of all learners are met. Our budget is also adjusted to provide opportunities for staff and administrators to  attend network conferences, citywide and state conferences, such as Everyone Reads and Engage NY Network Team  Institute (NTI.)    We make additional budgetary decisions to include programs such as, Extended Day and Saturday Academy to  provide at-risk students in grades 1-5 opportunities to increase student achievement.   We also will be using per session funds to enable teachers to collaboratively plan curriculum maps and units of study  for the 2017-18 school year. Our schedules allow for weekly common preps for teachers at all grade levels and subject  areas. Teachers use these common preps to attend professional learning sessions based on student data, student  work analysis, and trends found from informal and formal observations.    Budgetary funds are used to purchase guided reading books A - Z in both fiction and non-fiction to address the  instructional shifts and the HMH Read 180/System 44, iRead to support literacy at the students’ current levels.  Budgetary funds are also used to purchase Math180, and FASTT math to support all types of learners. Funds are used  for Extended Day Programs for students in grades 2-5, Saturday Academy for students in grades 3, 4, and 5, English  Language Learners (ELL) Extended Day program 2-5.   At P.S. 108, we value technology and as a result we appealed to the local politicians and were awarded a Resolution-A  grant. Over the years this grant allowed us to provide all classrooms with smart boards, document cameras and  computers.

P.S. 108K conducted a comprehensive assessment of our school’s academic program in response to the Framework  for Great Schools-Rigorous Instruction. This assessment was conducted by analyzing student performance trends,  reviewing findings from our Quality Review (QR) and utilizing other relevant data.   Based on the New York City (NYC) School Survey 2017-18 Report, 98% of our parents were satisfied with parent  teacher outreach, 97% were satisfied with parent involvement in the school, 97 % were satisfied with teacher-parent  trust and 97% were satisfied with parent-teacher trust. Our school invites parents/guardians to visit their child’s  classroom on Family Fridays; our teachers send home monthly newsletters to inform parents/guardians about new  learning and events happening in the grades.    Our schools strengths and needs are as follows:   ● Strengths: According to the 2014-15 Quality Review, P.S. 108K’s families are partners and are kept abreast of  student progress on a consistent basis. School leaders and staff convey high expectations through a robust system of  communication with students and families that reinforce the school’s expectations. Teachers share quarterly reports  with families, noting student progress and progress toward benchmarks. Teachers partner with families via scheduled  weekly check-ins that focus on areas of growth for students. Via workshops, parents understand how rubrics are used  across subjects to assess their child’s progress and are used at the weekly check-ins to review growth. Parents note  that the school helps them understand how they are preparing students for college and careers through workshops  on the new grading policy and Common Core Learning Standards. Schoolwide (CCLS), grade-wide and content area  newsletters are distributed monthly to inform families of what students will be working on for the month.    Students state that the school prepares them to be successful and helps them get more prepared and organized to  prepare for college and career. They set unit goals and develop plans to achieve their goals, which the student  monitors. Each student and family is able to monitor progress through the bi-monthly progress reports and work  portfolios for each unit of study that details the skills for mastery with accompanying work samples that confirm  mastery.    Priority Needs: We are continuing our partnership with our families. For the 2018-19 school year, P.S. 108K is  continuing their partnership with East New York Reads initiative.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  100% of P.S. 108K’s teachers are fully licensed and permanently assigned to PS 108K. 70% are teaching for more than  three years at this school. 85% have a Masters Degree plus 30 hours or higher. 100% core classes are taught by  “highly qualified” teachers.   Many of our new teachers are recruited through staff referrals, job fair, New Teacher Finder and Open Market. All  candidates are required to submit a resume, which is reviewed by our Professional Learning Team. We involve a  variety of staff in our new teacher interview process. Candidates are interviewed by administrators, staff developers  and members of our teaching staff. All candidates are required to conduct a Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS)  aligned demonstration lesson incorporating literacy into other content areas. The lessons are observed by a team  consisting of teachers, staff developers and administrative staff. This team then meets to collaboratively choose the  most highly qualified candidate. All teachers who join the PS 108K staff are provided with mentoring and support  from the administrative staff, staff developers and lead teachers on the grade.    The Professional Learning Team meet with non-tenured teachers every Thursday before school from 7:15AM - 7:59PM. These meetings are differentiated to meet the needs of new teachers, probationary teachers who have only  several years teaching experience and any other interested teachers.    We have a very extensive professional learning plan to ensure all pedagogical staff is provided with strategies for high  quality instruction designed to enable all students to meet the expectations of the common core. The professional  learning team funded by Title I, Contract for Excellence, and Fair Student Funding , TL Vision for School improvements,  Contract for Excellence monies, provide professional job-embedded support to every teacher in our school on a  weekly basis. All of our teachers are provided with a common preparation period during which the team engages  teachers in collaborative inquiry. We also provide all of our teachers with ongoing support by providing multiple  opportunities for professional learning. This support is provided through workshops, demonstration lessons, co- teaching, and one-on-one mentoring and coaching – focusing on support for English Language Learners and Students  With Disabilities incorporating Specially Designed Instruction, Universal Design for Learning principles, including  multiple entry points for lessons and units of study, explicit teaching of vocabulary, scaffolding – including  instructional practices and use of graphic organizers, explicit focus on text structure and features and the use of  Native Language to enhance reading and writing.

Teachers meet regularly with the administrative staff during one-on-one  conferences, post observation conferences, teacher teams and professional development sessions.   We also build respect and empower teachers by offering professional learning opportunities to all teachers on the  grade. Some students attend Brooklyn North workshops, UFT center workshops, and NYC DOE workshops. Teachers  are then expected to turnkey information gleaned from these workshops to their colleagues through work sessions,  intervisitations and one-on-one coaching, thus building an atmosphere of collegiality and support.       Two of 19K108 staff developers participated in the i3 training from NTC for the 2016-17 SY. One staff developer  continued her training with NTC for the 2017-18 SY and has registered for the 2018-19 SY. Additionally, 19K108's two  staff developers are UFT Teacher Center Staff Developers and are qualified to offer CTLE hours to staff. We also have  a Universal Literacy Coach. Every teacher is assigned a staff developer/mentor.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   All teachers meet in grade level groups at least three times a week with a member of the Professional Learning Team  during common prep periods, Monday professional development periods and Tuesday parent involvement sessions.  During these sessions teachers meet to analyze student work, reflect on teaching practices, engage in Lesson Study or  Instructional Rounds, collaboratively create curriculum and plan lessons and units of study. Teachers were provided  an opportunity to choose topics from a professional learning menu. An outside literacy consultant from Creative  Solutions will continue to work with teacher teams as well as individuals to enhance pedagogical skills in literacy.  Teacher were provided with a series of learning opportunities based on the topics of their choice. We also provide  selected teachers with opportunities to attend professional development provided by the New York City Department  of Education, Brooklyn North, and the UFT Teacher Center.    The Professional Learning Team funded by Title I, Contract for Excellence, and Fair Student Funding , TL Vision for  School improvements, Contract for Excellence monies,, will provide professional support to our teachers on a daily  basis. All of our teachers are provided with common preparation periods. During which, the team engages teachers in  professional learning opportunities, including but not limited to collaborative inquiry, lesson study, instructional  rounds, inter-visitations, demonstration lessons and videotaping of lessons for professional learning purposes.    We will continue to provide teachers and paraprofessionals with opportunities to select topics for professional  learning from a menu of choices which best meet their professional needs. All teachers from grades Pre-K through 5  and specialty teachers are required to engage in lesson study or instructional rounds to further their pedagogical skills  and student achievement. During lesson study, teachers meet in grade level teams to analyze student and teacher  data. With the support of the professional learning team, these teams of teachers research best practices to meet the  needs of their students.    Our bilingual teachers funded with Tax Levy Fair Student Funding , and our Students With Disabilities staff developer  provide bi-weekly staff development to teachers of Dual Language (ELL) and Students With Disabilities (SWD) focusing  on analyzing student work to support for ELL students and SWD. This gives us the opportunity to meet vertically and  horizontally to analyze student work, identify gaps in understanding, determine implications for instruction thus  yielding improved student achievement.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  P.S. 108K’s transition plan used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary school  program consists of providing our students and families with a welcoming environment, including them in joint  decisions, ensuring they receive ongoing communication during the summer and throughout the year and extending  the learning between home and school. This serves to keep our parents informed and creates a learning partnership  that will enhance our students learning experience. To further assist our children, we build families’ capacity and  develop solid partnerships with them in supporting children’s learning and development. We believe that the earlier  in a child's educational process family involvement begins, the more powerful the potential effects on the student’s  learning.   At P.S. 108K, is utilizing the NYCDOE Bundles Units of Study. This ensures all students are prepared for the rigorous  instruction in kindergarten.    Parent workshops are offered in June 2018 and September 2018 to allow for a smooth transition into kindergarten.  An introduction to kindergarten teachers and a tour of the kindergarten classes is provided to prepare parents and  student for a smooth transition. Parent workshops targeting specific topics will be conducted monthly throughout the  school year.   Pre- Kindergarten teachers prepare students by immersing their students in books and engage in rich discussions  regarding kindergarten and what they can expect. The Moving-Up Ceremony provides our students with a sense of  accomplishment, readiness, and excitement about their new year in kindergarten.   The Social Worker attends professional development sessions related to the importance of transitions into  kindergarten and turnkeys information to staff developer and pre-k teachers.    Pre-K teachers provide informational materials to parents that will engage students in summer activities that promote  literacy and math skills for kindergarten.   Teachers are required to provide parents and kindergarten teachers with the Work Sampling System Summary Report  to show the students developmental progress throughout the year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81      The social worker has an integral role acting as the liaison between parents and agencies to aid and support parents in  obtaining services for children with Individualize Education Plans. This includes supporting families in the referral  process and continued services through Committee of Pre-School Special Education (CPSE.)        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The decision making process (The Consultation Committee, School Leadership Team and Professional Learning  Committee) that teachers at P.S. 108K participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate multiple  assessment measures are as follow:                In ELA teachers assess students using F & P running records and Reading Inventory Iexiles benchmark  assessments. Data is analyze by grade, class, subgroups, and yearly progress. This data is used to  communicate with the families and to track, monitor and revise the progress of our students throughout the  grades. READ 180 and System 44 is used in all third through fifth grade classrooms. Lexile assessment data is  used to track and monitor ten month progress of our students. iRead is utilized in grade K-2 classrooms to  support students individualized needs based on the FRA assessment.  In writing, teachers continue to reflect on and analyze students work using Lucy Calkins Writing Progressions  Rubrics (informative, narrative, and opinion) using pre and post on demand tasks. They also utilize the NYS  ELA 2 point short response and 4 point extended response rubrics for Response to Literature Writing.  In mathematics, teachers are collaboratively designing grade-wide assessments for the implementation of  Eureka Math/Engageny modules. These assessments will include beginning, middle and end of the year  assessment, as well pre and post assessments. Teachers analyze students’ assessments by grade, class and  sub groups to monitor and revise the progress of our students. We utilize the FASTT Math Program to address  fluency, MI Assessments to provide a measure of students' readiness for mathematics instruction in the form  of Quantile measure for grades 2-5, which span the 5 content standards. Math 180 is utilized in 5th grade  classrooms to support students individualized needs based on the MI assessment.   Science and Social Studies: Teams of teachers create systematic grade-wide assessments in science and social  studies. based upon the learning standards. The data is inputted into spreadsheets and analyzed by grade,  class and subgroups. A-Z for science specialty teachers to support their implementation of station teaching,  and Fundations for grades K-2.    The following is provided regarding the use of assessment results to improve instruction in our schools:     Cabinet analyzes the data    Data is shared with the School Wide Inquiry Team    Data is transparent and shared school wide    Grade Teams analyze the data by grade, class, and subgroups to identify gaps in student learning, trends,   standards, progress, etc   Our teams of teachers meet several times throughout the week with the professional learning team. For instance,  grade wide teacher teams, Monday afternoon Professional Learning, English Language Learners (ELL) teacher team bi  weekly and Students with Disabilities (SWD) teacher teams bi weekly. A school wide inquiry team meets to discuss  data across the grades. This gives us the opportunity to meet vertically and horizontally to analyze student work,  identify gaps in understanding, determine implications for instruction thus yielding improved student achievement.    Teacher team meeting time has been deeply embedded in the educational philosophy of the staff at P.S. 108. Data is  at the forefront of our instructional decisions. We begin by looking at teacher and student data. Data specialists  provide data to all staff. The Professional Learning Team support analysis of the data to drive instructional decisions  within the teachers classroom.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          82         In grades 3-5 the Item Analysis Tool is utilized to compare PS 108K to the state and city and to identify which  standards we performed the strongest and which standards we performed the lowest so that we may work towards  closing the gaps in learning.       During initial planning conferences and end year teacher conferences teachers reflect on progress made by students  in the previous year with the administrators. Teachers create professional goals for student progress based on this  data. Additionally, data is analyzed during meetings with the professional learning team to identify the gaps and  inconsistencies in teacher and student achievement. Teams of teachers work together to determine implications for  instruction, plan lessons, and create targeted intervention for at-risk students .        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          84      available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          85      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 108K, The Sal Abbracciamento School , in compliance with the Section  1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.

The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

The Title III funds will be used to work towards closing the achievement gap  of ELL students. The participating students are two or more years below grade level in reading  according to our Fountas and Pinnell assessments and Read 180 SRI and iRead results from our  2017-18 school year. A large percentage of our ELL students do not demonstrate mastery on  their grade level baseline math assessment administered in English during the fall. Students will  receive instruction in Math and ELA to provide them with the support they need to help them  make a year's progress in literacy and math. Title III AIS will be supplemented. The percentage  of ELL students that scored at levels 3 and 4 on the 2016-2017 New York  State ELA Assessment was 0% of grade 3 students, 13.3 % of grade 4 and 14. 3% and 14.3 % of  students in grade 5. The percentage of ELL students that scored at levels 3 and 4 on the 2016- 2017 New York State Math Assessment was 0% of grade 3 students, 14.3 % of grade 4 and 14.  3% and 16.7 % of students in grade 5.  As a result of low percentage of ELLs who scored at or  above grade level, we will provide additional support to our ELL students with our Title III  funding.  Subgroups and grade levels of students to be served:    The students will be served in groups of 15.  The groups of students will be ELLs from  Kindergarten, first grade, second grade, third grade, fourth grade and  fifth grade.

Our new teachers will receive professional  development to learn different strategies for teaching ELL students.  The value of the ELL  students' first language and culture as foundations for continued success will be conveyed to new  teachers serving ELL students.      Teachers do not always come prepared with knowledge to close the gaps with ELLs. Staff  Developers will provide Professional Development during the school day to ensure the teachers  can identify the entry points of each student based on their language proficiency. Teachers will  learn how to use the language progression to  help them identify what English language learners  need  in order to maximize their learning and participation. They will help teachers to choose  content, vocabulary, and tasks that are appropriate to each learner’s age, stage, and language- learning needs. The most important determinant of student's success is the qualified teacher in  the classroom.      Teachers to receive training/provider:    The teachers delivering the services for the Title lll program will meet with the school ELL Staff  Developer, Mary Scarpa, to analyze student data and to determine the instructional and  assessment needs of the ELL students enrolled in the Title lll program.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use Fountas and Pinnell to assess early literacy skills in grades K - 5.  We also use Reading Inventory (RI), Phonics Inventory  (PI), and Measures of Student Learning (MOSL).  The data is analyzed to identify current student thinking and surfacing  gaps. We also use the iRead Foundational Reading Program assessments for grades K - 2 and READ 180 lexiles for grades 3 - 5.  The iRead Program is a computerized reading program which screens each student and assigns them their reading level or  unit. The students are then continuously assessed and once they reach 49% in phonemic awareness, they are switched to the  reading comprehension segment of the program.              2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          101      Teachers provide targeted instruction to address the strengths and next learning steps of the students.  The students  are grouped based on language proficiency.  The teachers use authentic literature, story cards, and non-fiction magazines as  well as other resources and materials such as Appendix B,  and Eurika math.      The data shows that most ELL students in the lower grades are below grade level in English Language Arts compared to their  English Proficient (EPs) peers  in the areas of vocabulary development and phonemic awareness. The majority of these ELLs are  at the Emerging/Transitioning levels.  As a result, these students receive AIS support during the day.  The AIS paraprofessionals  push into the classes throughout the day,  during the literacy block, to provide small group, individualized and differentiated  instruction. Students receive small group instruction with UDL and ENL strategies.  Grades K - 2 students who are at the  Emerging and Transitioning levels use various online resources such as iRead, to provide literacy support in the areas of  phonemic awareness and vocabulary development.  Students in grades 3 to 5 who are at the Expanding level use technology- based reading programs such as Read 180 to support phonemic awareness, vocabulary development and reading  comprehension.     For the past school year, we have been using Fundations, a multi-sensory, structured language program for grades K-2 and  Self- Contained classes in grades 3 and 4.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We use NYC Performance Tasks to assess the students' academic progress in both ELA and Math.  Analysis of the results will  show students’ areas of need for each subject.    We also use the iRead Foundational Reading Program for grades K - 2.  This is a new digital foundational reading program  designed to close the achievement gap early on and place all K - 2 children on a predictable path towards reading proficiently  by grade 3. The iRead program analyzes students' growth by measuring their daily data collection and comparing it against  grade-level benchmarks.     The ELL Periodic Assessment, RI (Reading Inventory), PI (Phonics Inventory) and Fountas and Pinnell assessments  provide teachers with detailed information about their students' strengths and needs in English Language Development and  serves as a resource to help plan individual and group instruction. Some of the area of needs that are identified through the RI,  PI and Fountas and Pinnell are students reading levels, vocabulary, comprehension skills, fluency, recognition of sounds and  letters.         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered from all baseline assessments, it is discussed by the Dual Language teacher  team for grades K-5. This team of teachers meets to ensure that research-based ELL strategies, language progressions and the  principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) are incorporated into their instruction to provide support and equal access for  all students, especially ELLs, FELLs and SIFE students. We also analyze Measures of Student Learning (MOSL) performance task  data, as well as Fountas and Pinnell, HMH Reading Inventory, HMH Phonics Inventory.  The team also uses the data to create a  focus of study.  A lesson study is created to implement best practices.  The team develops the lessons and the teachers take  turn teaching it after it is analyzed and changes are made to meet the needs of all students.  The Dual Language teacher team meets to analyze student work and identify the current student thinking vs. the desired  student thinking, as well as the implications for instruction for their targeted populations. Teachers have been and will  continue to utilize this time to collaboratively plan and modify literacy lessons to meet the needs of our ELLs. Teams of  teachers also are engaged in learning opportunities to provide students with explicit instruction in providing text-based  evidence to inform and explain their writing during class discussions. The Dual Language Teacher Team uses vertical planning  in order to provide continuity of instruction and best practices throughout the grades.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          102      Response To Intervention (RTI):    We use multiple indicators such as Fountas and Pinnell, MOSL, RI scores, ELA and Math Benchmarks as well as teacher  observations to accurately assess students' academic deficiencies.    Within the first month of school, data is gathered for students who are new admits. Updated data is also gathered for students  who needed more than Core Instruction at the end of the previous school year.  Students receive supplemental instruction  from the classroom teacher, after analyzes of multiple sources of data. response to intervention is  is provided  based on the  area of weakness such as Phonemic Awareness, Phonics, Fluency, Vocabulary, or Comprehension.    Students who are identified as Tier 3 in the fall are given more intensive instruction by someone other than the classroom  teacher. Instruction is based on the area of weakness. Our AIS/RTI coordinator who is also one of our data specialists,  recommends research based programs based on a student’s area of weakness.  Approximately every 6 to 8 weeks, students’ progress are reviewed and a decision is made if the program is working. If the  program is working and the student still needs extra support they continue to provide RTI using a different program.           6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].     NYSESLAT:    We evaluate the success of our Dual Language and ENL programs by analyzing the results of the NYSESLAT and the ELA state  assessment using the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) and the RLAT during the Dual Language teacher team to create lesson  plans that would meet the needs of all ELL students based on their language proficiency and acquisition levels. We also analyze  the growth in reading levels as evidenced by Fountas and Pinnell scores.  The 2017 NYSESLAT indicates that our students  continue to show growth in the four modalities.  In Spring 2017, 115 ELLs took the NYSESLAT exam.  This year's NYSESLAT  results show that 10% are Entering, 13% are Emerging, 12% are Transitioning, 37% are Expanding and 30% at the Commanding  level who became proficient (FELLS).     NYSITELL:    Fall 2017 NYSITELL is ongoing. This is the most recent results for kindergarten students: 35 students have been tested so  far.  There are  30 Entering, 9 Emerging, 6 Transitioning, 4 Expanding and 34 Commanding or Proficient students.  During their  literacy centers the students will be using living books and other audio-visual materials.      NYS ELA Assessment:     None of our ELLs met the new criteria of scoring 3 or 4 on the NYS ELA assessment and attaining Expanding level on  the NYSESLAT.    New York State English Language Arts (NYS ELA) data was analyzed to identify current student thinking and performance gaps.  Our findings were that across all grades we found that our students were becoming more adept at citing evidence, and using  relevant details from text to support their answers. However, it was noted that students are not using a sufficient amount of  details to develop ideas, explain why the details support their inferences and are not elaborating properly. This led to our  decision to continue the instructional focus of using evidence in argument to frame our work, provide a coherent structure to  our instruction and provide students with the necessary instruction to meet grade level expectations as outlined in the CCLS.    Analysis of our 2017 NYS ELA and NYS Math Assessment data indicates that although none of our ELLS scored at level 3 or 4,  they are approaching grade level.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          103                   7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The School Wide Team and the school cabinet meet to review the data generated from the interim benchmark assessments,  such as Fountas and Pinnell, Lexile scores, iREAD data, as well as NYS Assessments.   The findings of all assessments are analyzed in our Dual Language Teacher Teams which meet every week.  Our two DL Teacher  Teams then decide on strategies and methodologies that can be implemented in their classrooms in order to address and  target the learning gaps shown in the assessments.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   ENL Program:    We have an ENL push-in program.  ENL is taught by two certified ENL teachers.  Teachers provide ENL instruction with  home language support as needed.  Students are grouped heterogeneously.  The ENL teachers provide support for  their students through standalone and integrated ENL.  Students receive the mandated periods of ENL based on their  proficiency levels as measured on their NYSESLAT and/or NYSITELL scores.        b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Dual Language Program:      Our Dual Language program is a self-contained program, with one Dual Language class per grade.  Classes are mixed  heterogeneously across proficiency levels.  Each teacher holds a Common Branch license and a Bilingual Extension  license. A mix of English Language Learners and English Proficient students are enrolled in all of our Dual Language  classes.  The Bilingual teachers provide support for their students through standalone and integrated ENL.      Instruction in the Dual Language classes alternate between Spanish and English, 70% of English and 30% of Spanish.  ENL is provided/embedded during the guided reading block. Students receive the required periods of HLA, ELA and  ENL based on their NYSESLAT or NYSITELL scores.              2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          104      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Dual Language:    Instruction in the Dual Language classes alternate between Spanish and English, 70% of English and 30% of Spanish. ENL is  provided/embedded during the guided reading block. Students receive the required periods of HLA, ELA and ENL based on  their NYSESLAT or NYSITELL scores.     All Students in the Dual Language classroom receive 45 minutes of Spanish HLA per day as well as 90 minutes in Bilingual  Content Area subjects in Math and Science.    ENL:    The ENL teachers provide support for their students through standalone and integrated ENL.  Students receive the required  periods of ENL based on their NYSESLAT or NYSITELL scores.     For ELLs in both ENL and Dual Language the instructional minutes are as follows:       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Dual Language:    In the Dual Language classrooms, content area subjects are taught in both Spanish and English, using second language  acquisition strategies and the use of content rich visual aides.   Science is taught in Spanish and Math is alternated every other  day between Spanish and English. As of this year, the entire school, grades K-5, will be using the Eureka-Engage NY  Mathematics program.  We will continue to use the technology-based programs, Math 180 and FASTT Math for  Mathematics.  Students receive targeted instruction based on their needs and next learning steps.  We specifically use  Harcourt Ciencias for Science since it comes in both languages. Spanish-English glossaries are available in  Math, Science and  Social Studies for all ELL students.      The science specialty teacher is Bilingual and provides Science instruction in the Spanish Dual Language classes. Universal  Design for Learning (UDL) is provided through multiple means of presentation of new vocabulary and concepts.     ENL    Content Area instruction is delivered in English using UDL, content rich books, total physical response, as well as visual aides  and realia.  All classes in grades K-5 use the Eureka-Engage NY Math program. Teachers of ELLs in monolingual classrooms  incorporate lots of second language acquisition strategies throughout the day, even when teaching content area subjects.  Total Physical Response and the Language Experience approach are some of the methodologies used by ENL teachers.  ENL  teachers also use supplemental materials such as the Oxford Content Area Picture Dictionary.  They incorporate non-fiction  social studies and science books as part of the Guided Reading curriculum.  Bilingual glossaries are used to support instruction  in all content areas for ELLs who speak Spanish, Arabic and Bengali.          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   The English Language Learners in the Dual Language classes are assessed twice with a beginning and end of year HLA or Home  Language Assessment MOSL in Spanish.  It is designed to assess the student's literacy achievement in Spanish. This test is  administered to ELLs and EPs in grades K-5.  Some ELLs in the Dual Language Classes are assessed in Spanish for Math, Science  and Social Studies.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          105      ELLs have the option to take the NYS Mathematics and Science Assessments in their native Spanish.  ELLs who are speakers of  other languages other than Spanish are provided an interpreter when taking these exams.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.  SIFE     SIFE students are pulled out during the school day to receive small group instruction with a bilingual paraprofessional who  tutors them using the My Sidewalks reading program. A bilingual teacher provides small group Math instruction for SIFE  students in grades 4 and 5.   They also attend the after school program, which meets on Wednesdays and Thursdays from  2:21pm to 3:21pm. 3rd, 4th and 5th grade SIFE students also attend the Saturday Academy Program which provides ENL  instruction with Native Language support in Mathematics and the Content areas. The purpose of these supplemental programs  is to provide ENL and HLA instruction as well as the academic and content language support that these students lack.  These  classes are taught by certified bilingual teachers.       Newcomers (Plan for ELLs in School less than 3 years):    ELLs with less than 3 years of service who are deemed Entering or Emerging, receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week,  180 minutes of stand alone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA. During guided reading these children receive small  group instruction. The at risk students also receive the support of a paraprofessional who provides small group instruction  using the My Sidewalks reading program.  The students are grouped based on language proficiency to provide targeted  instruction to address their strengths and next learning steps.       Developing ELLs (Plan for Developing ELLs in school 4-6 Years):    ELLs with 4 to 6 years of service receive ENL instruction according to their proficiency level.  Entering and Emerging students  receive 360 minutes of ENL, Transitioning and Expanding students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction.  ENL  and Dual Language students receive reading instruction through the READ 180, System 44 and iRead reading programs.  The  SETSS teacher also provides small group instruction for some of these students.  Most of these ELLs participate in our After  School and Saturday Academy programs. Some of these students receive additional small group support through the Fountas  & Pinnell Intervention reading program, throughout the school day.       Long Term ELLs (Plan for ELLs in school 6 years or more):    Currently, there are no long-term ELLs in our building.  However, if we were to receive a transfer student who is deemed a  long-term ELL, this child would receive the same services as students with 4-6 years of service, such as, the tutorial and after  school programs, Saturday Academy, READ 180, iRead as well as small group ENL and ELA instruction.  In addition, this student  would get one on one support from a Bilingual paraprofessional for reading and writing.        FELLs or Former ELLs:     FELLs receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL per week for two years.  This instruction is provided by the ENL and Bilingual  teachers.      FELLs who have passed the NYSESLAT continue to receive testing accommodations for up to two years.  They are given  extended time and are allowed the use of glossaries.  Their parents are informed of these accommodations. The former ELLs in  our school continue to receive small group instruction through the use of the READ 180, iRead reading program during the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          106      school day. Classroom teachers continue to use ENL strategies with these students to ensure their continued language  development as FELLs.  These students are also invited to the after-school program.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?      Teachers use several instructional strategies to teach ELL-SWDs. UDL, ENL strategies, scaffolding, native language support,  vocabulary development and modified guided reading are some of the strategies used to accelerate English language  development. Teachers also use the Eureka Engage New York Math Program, Read 180 and iRead technology-based literacy  programs.  Strategies like close reading and Total Physical Response or TPR are also used.     Plan for ELL Students with Special Needs/ Disabilities:     Several of our ELLs are students with special needs.  Some of our ELL students with IEPs are in general education classes. The  ENL teachers push in to work with all of these students who are in a monolingual setting.  The Bilingual teachers work with the  students in the Dual Language classes.  In addition, the upper grade students use the technology based System 44, READ 180,  iREAD reading programs which focus on phonemic awareness, vocabulary development, comprehension and self-correction.  ENL teachers provide ENL support to Special Education teachers by sharing ENL strategies and materials.      Native Language Materials:    Dual Language classes use the Treasures and Tesoros Series for guided reading.   They also use Spanish textbooks for Math,  Science and Social Studies. The Oxford Content Picture Dictionary and bilingual glossaries are used to provide native language  support.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL: Modified Guided Reading as a support service for SWD students who are ELLs.  ENL teachers and Dual Language teachers  provide small group instruction during the guided reading/literacy block.  SWD: Specially Designed Instruction (SDI): Teachers adapt, as appropriate, the content, methodology, or delivery of instruction  to address the unique needs of a child that results from the child's disability; this ensures access of the child to the general  curriculum, so that he or she can meet the educational standards.  Least restrictive environment is always priority when designing and implementing a program. Special education should learn in  the least restrictive environment (LRE). This means they should spend as much time as possible with peers who do not receive  special education.  Student’s goals are aligned with common core standards. Students are held to the same standard as the general education  student. Our school offers flex programming for students with disabilities. If the student is doing exceptionally well in an  academic area, the student will move to a less restrictive environment for that period to meet their needs.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  ELA Intervention/Support:    ELA: The following interventions programs offered in English for ELLs in ELA are as follows:       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      PS 108 will provide increased bilingual instruction by offering one Dual Language classes on the Pre-K level.   This change is due to parent request and our feedback from parent workshops.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          107      The data shows that most ELL students in the lower grades are below grade level in English Language Arts compared to their  English Proficient (EPs) peers in the areas of vocabulary development and phonemic awareness.    As a result,  we started a new phonics program called Fundations as well as a technology-based reading program called  iRead for students in grades K - 2.  Eurika math replaced the GoMath in our school.      Students in  grades K-5 will be invited to partake in a special after-school program geared to meet the language needs of  English Language Learners.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Equal Access to all Programs:    Our enrichment programs are available to all our students including ELLs, throughout the week. All of our students receive the  mandated minutes of Physical Education and the Arts.  ELLs have equal access and opportunities to participate in all  programs.  Some of these programs include the Dance and Theatre club, Art club, Coding club, PE Saturday Academy.  ELLs are  also invited and encouraged to participate in all after school and Saturday Academy programs.          12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional Materials Including Technology:    ENL students in grades 3-5 use the READ 180  and System 44 technology-based reading program, while ENL students in grades  K-2 use the iRead Foundational program.       At risk and special education ELLs receive differentiated instruction through the use of the technology based Reading Program  System44.    All grades use the technology based math program called FASST Math.    We use a variety of materials to enhance our ELLs’ language acquisition.  Kindergarten Dual Language classes use the  Benchmark Learning Spanish and English Explorers reading program.  The 1st – 5th grade Dual Language classes use the  McGraw-Hill Treasures and Tesoros reading program, and Rigby’s On Our Way To English. The Oxford Content Area Picture  Dictionaries are used for the SIFE students and all newcomers.        Instructional materials in Content Areas:    ELLs in grades K-5 use Eurika Math program. All Dual Language classes use Science and Social Studies textbooks in Spanish and  English.  These textbooks include Harcourt’s Ciencias and Estudios Sociales.  The Oxford Picture Dictionary series supports  Science and Social Studies vocabulary development.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native Language Support    In the Dual Language classes, Science instruction is provided by the bilingual classroom teacher.  Dual Language teachers  provide Social Studies instruction in both Spanish and English.  Bilingual paraprofessionals provide small group tutoring  through the My Sidewalks intervention programs.  The READ 180 program has a native language component which allows   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          108         students to preview a 5 minute clip of the upcoming unit on their laptops in Spanish, French and several different languages.  All dual language classes have bilingual word walls.  This component is helpful to both ENL and Dual language students.      In ENL classes, teachers use cognates, bilingual content area picture dictionaries and bilingual science and social studies  glossaries.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All required services and resources correspond to ELLs ages and grade levels. All students have access to technology as an  integral part of their instruction on a daily basis.  Beginners, Intermediates and younger students benefit from more  manipulatives, visuals and hands on activities.  Advanced and older students are given more challenging texts and tasks which  encourage them to back up their arguments and opinions with evidence from the text.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   N/A     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   a. P.S. 108 has self-contained Dual Language classes.  We have two Dual Language classes in Pre-K.  There  is one dual language class on each grade from Kindergarten to 5th grade.  ELLs and EPs are integrated  through out the day.  Each teacher has a bilingual license and provides instruction in English and Spanish.  70% of the instruction is in English and 30% is in Spanish.  EPs and ELLs are integrated all day, for literacy,  science, math, social studies, physical education, and the Arts.    b. Social Studies is taught in English. Science and Math are taught in both English and Spanish.  c. During guided reading students receive small-group instruction in English based on their strengths and  next learning steps.  Newcomers and Entering ELLs also receive guided reading instruction in Spanish.       d. Emergent literacy is differentiated to meet the students at their point of entry.  If it is deemed that the  student will benefit from being taught in the child’s native language first,  it will be sequential.  If the child  demonstrates strong literacy skills in Language 1, then the child will receive instruction simultaneously in  both languages.                 2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          109      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional Development and Support for School Staff     The focus of our professional development plan for the 2018-2019 school year is to strengthen student work and teacher  practice by continuing to examine and implement Next Generation Learning Standards and the Danielson Framework for  Teachers. Our goal is to strengthen student work by refining classroom instruction with teacher effectiveness.       Professional development is provided to every teacher in our school  by our UFTTC staff developers. The following school  personnel receive professional development along with the teachers: paraprofessionals, psychologist, guidance counselor,  occupational/physical therapists, speech therapists, secretaries, school aides and the parent coordinator.  The entire staff  participates in special inquiry teacher teams where the needs of all our students, including ELLs and students with disabilities,  are analyzed. All of our teachers are provided with common preparation periods during which the Staff Developers engage  teachers in study group activities.   The needs of our ELL students are addressed during these sessions and team meetings. The  staff development team provides additional professional development to all teachers including teachers of English Language  Learners through demonstration lessons, lesson studies, instructional rounds,  model lessons, co-teaching  and inter- visitations.  We have an Dual Language Teacher Team for grades K-5. This team meets weekly.    Teachers of ELLs in Dual Language and Monolingual classes attend professional development sessions.    These workshops will  cover the following topics:     ELL Teacher Staff Development schedule    New Teachers Meetings -Thursdays: 7:15AM – 8:00AM  There is a Dual Language Teacher Team which meets on Mondays from 8:45AM - 9:30AM.  These Inquiry Team sessions provide Dual Language and ENL teachers the opportunity to develop lesson studies by  analyzing student data and work samples. This is done to focus on strategies which can be implemented across the grades to  move student achievement in the four modalities. There will also be professional development focusing on deepening  teachers’ knowledge, understanding and application of second language acquisition strategies to support recently arrived  ELLs.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our school provides professional development to all teachers and staff that specifically addresses the needs of English  language learners.  All teachers receive a minimum of 15% of the required professional development hours which is focused  on best practices for co-teaching and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs, as well as language acquisition for  English Language Learners.     All bilingual and ENL teachers receive a minimum of 50% of the required hours in ELL specific topics such as language  acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language  and content instruction for ELLs.  Training is provided during professional development days, faculty conferences as well as  new teacher workshops. All staff is aware of the importance of providing support to the ELLs that attend our school and their  families.

This  information is differentiated according to their ages and grade levels. She has an open door policy for all ELL students in which  she helps them with social, behavioral and personal challenges. In addition, she guides parents and students through the  transition from elementary to middle school by facilitating the selection and application process for choosing a middle school  which best meets their child’s needs. She aides the students in writing their personal essays and guides them into evaluating  their own interests and abilities. As with any student at PS 108K, ELLs receive counseling, crisis assistance and peer mediation  from the guidance counselor whenever necessary.    Jose P. Mandated Training    All of our new teachers will receive the 7.5 hours of ELL training as per the Jose P. mandate throughout the year. New special  education teachers receive 10 hours of training.  The Jose P. training will be held in the fall. The sessions will be a combination  of after school and school day trainings.  The after school sessions will be held on Wednesdays from 2:30PM-4:00PM, starting  in November, 2018. Sessions will be conducted by the ENL teachers and a Bilingual teacher.  During these meetings, teachers  will be informed about compliance issues, the identification process for ELL students, testing accommodations and strategies  for differentiating and supporting ELLs in their classrooms.  Attendance, agendas and completion certificates will all be kept on  file by the ENL teachers and the Assistant Principal in charge of ELLs.    Professional Development for ENL and Bilingual Teachers    50% of the total hours of PD are ELL-specific for ENL and Bilingual Teachers  15% of the total hours of PD for all teachers is ELL-specific.  These professional development hours will be dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area  instruction, including a focus on integrating language and content instruction for ELLs.    ELL-specific PD is given during the extended day on Mondays from 2:21PM-4:00PM    Content Area PD    * Science teachers meet weekly with staff developers to discuss curriculum and strategies to support ELLs and SWDs  * Social Studies and Math professional development is given to all classroom teachers during weekly grade wide team  meetings.     The ENL teachers attend periodic ENL meetings facilitated by Brooklyn North ELL specialists. The information from the  meetings is turn-keyed to the professional development team, school administration and pedagogical staff. The Staff  Development team and ENL teachers also provide our Dual Language  teachers with professional development in Literacy,  Mathematics, and ENL strategies. Differentiated Instruction for students who are English Language Learners is embedded in all  lesson planning and workshops.     Agendas and sign-in sheets for all workshops and PDs are kept on file by Staff Developers.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parental Involvement for Parents of ELLs     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          111         Teachers will individually meet with parents or guardians of new English Language Learners at the beginning of the year to  welcome the parents and students. At the first Open House in September, the goals of the ENL and Dual Language programs,  the types of assessments students will take, and the availability of translation and interpretation services will be discussed.     Teachers will also meet with the parents or guardians of English language learners during conferences, orientations, and  Tuesday Parent Involvement time. These meetings will inform the parents or guardians about the child's language  development in all content areas.  Meetings will be held in English and in the parents' preferred language through the use of a  translator.  In-house Interpreters are available for French and Spanish speaking parents. We use the DOE's over-the phone  translation unit for meetings involving parents who speak other languages.     Teachers of ELLs meet with parents on Tuesday afternoons from 2:21p.m - 3:15p.m.  During these meetings, parents are  apprised of their child's language development progress and the interventions that will be utilized to help their child succeed.    Our goal is to encourage families to be actively involved in the learning community of our school. Our Bilingual Parent  Coordinator, in conjunction with the staff development team, provides a plethora of workshops throughout the year to engage  parents in the education of their children.  Some of these workshops explore the Common Core Learning Standards, State and  City assessments, and school expectations.  These workshops are provided in English and Spanish.      Parents of newly enrolled ELL students are provided with two orientation sessions in September. The sessions provide  information about the ELL programs we offer: ENL and Dual Language. These orientation sessions are separate and apart from  regularly scheduled parent meetings and are conducted by the ENL teachers and  the Parent Coordinator.      We occasionally invite community based organizations to send in special speakers and offer their services to our parents.     PS 108 partners with Cypress Hills Community Development Corp. This community based organization provides GED, and ENL  classes. They also hold informational sessions about job fairs, health care and other services.     We also partner with New York Psychotherapy and Counseling Center.  This organization provides workshops and assistance to  parents.  When these workshops are offered in our school building, the Parent coordinator ensures that the information is  translated.    All parents/guardians are invited to visit their children's classrooms on a monthly basis during Family Fridays. These classroom  visits are held on the last Friday of each month. It provides parents an opportunity to actively participate in their child's school  learning environment.     The Parent Coordinator evaluates parental needs by having parents fill out surveys indicating the types of workshops and/or  services they would like us to offer.       PTA Meetings are held on the third Tuesday of each month from 4:30PM – 5:30PM. During these meetings, special student  achievement is celebrated.  Students who have perfect attendance and the student/athlete of the month from each class, are  recognized.    A monthly calendar, as well as grade newsletters are sent to each of our students’ home in an effort to keep parents informed  of current activities and upcoming events in the school.          2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   ELL Parent Involvement:    Parents of newly enrolled ELL students are provided with two orientation sessions in September. The sessions provide  information about the ELL programs we offer: ENL and Dual Language. These orientation sessions are separate and apart from  regularly scheduled parent meetings and are conducted by the ENL teachers and the Parent Coordinator.    We often invite community based organizations to send in special speakers and offer their services to our parents. PS 108  partners with Cypress Hills Community Development Corp. This community based organization provides GED, and ENL  classes as well as hold informational sessions about job fairs, health care and other services.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          112            Based on the needs assessment analysis of the parent concern forms and parent surveys, the following activities and  workshops are being offered.         * "Grade Expectations"- Each grade engages in grade expectation workshops which provide parents with the school's  expectations for each grade       * Family Fridays - The last Friday of every month has been designated as Family Friday.  At this time parents are invited to  visit the classroom while instruction is going on so that they can experience the education we provide for their children.         * Dual Language Festival - This is a multicultural festival that is held in our school yard and/or cafeteria during the  month of  June. The culture and customs of our ELLs are celebrated at this event.       A bilingual monthly calendar, as well as a school newsletter is sent to each of our students’ home in an effort to keep parents  informed of current activities and upcoming events in the school.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    ELL Program Success    Upon reviewing the most recent NYSESLAT scores , we can see that our students are progressing through the hierarchy of  modalities as expected. The overall proficiency levels continue to rise across the grades.  On the Spring 2017 NYSESLAT, we had a  total of 30 students who advanced one proficiency level or more.  We also had 20 students become commanding.       Our success is further measured by the high number of parent choice for our schools’ Dual Language Program. After five years of  Spanish as a second language, almost half of EPs scored in the second quartiles on the ELE Spanish Reading Exam, showing that  they are starting to be functionally bi-literate.  These results show that the Dual Language program continues to successfully  prepare students for a bilingually challenging world.                               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          113   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Constance Hahn, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          114                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   SAL Abbracciamento                                                                              School DBN: 19K108  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We use parent responses on Part III of the HLIS, the Parent's Preferred Home Language Report (RCPL), the Home  Language Report (RHLA), the Adult Preferred Language Report (RAPL) on ATS, and student emergency contact  cards, to track any new languages that are used in our school community. At registration we distribute the New  York City Parent Guide to Language Access Language Cards which help the parents inform us of the language they  speak. Looking at our language surveys, 47% of our students' households speak a language other than English. The  vast majority speak English and or Spanish. A few of our parents speak Arabic, Bengali, Haitian Creole, Urdu and  Chinese.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          116     2.

Written Spanish  translations are done in- house by school  personnel, such as the  Parent Coordinator,  Bilingual teachers, and  ENL teachers. When a  translation into a  language other than  Spanish is needed, the  parent coordinator sends  the document to the  Interpretation/Translation  Unit.    Documents distributed by  the school community:  teachers, guidance  counselors,  administration, etc., are  disseminated in English  and Spanish.            2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as   parent-teacher   conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.

The attendance  teacher and  guidance  counselor are  both bilingual and  will make calls in  both English and  Spanish. We also  use translators for  IEP meetings. We  use the  Interpretation  and Translation  unit for  calls/meetings  involving other  languages.      During these  Tuesday Parent  meetings,  teachers can  communicate  with  parents/guardians  who speak other  languages by  having telephone  conferences with  interpreters from  the Translation  Unit.    3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In case of an emergency, the language access coordinator will send out a message in English and Spanish to all parents  via our automated phone messaging system. For parents who speak a language other than English or Spanish, there is  a school staff member assigned to each grade, who will call the Language Line to have this message translated into  the parent's preferred language. The language line will call the parents with the translated message.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          119        Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      On September 4th, 2018, Chancellor's Conference day, Ms. Joana Garcia and Clara Stevens, our school LACs, will  review Chancellor's Regulation A-663 with the entire faculty. All staff members will receive a written copy of  Chancellor's Regulation A-663 in their school handbook. The handbook will also contain the phone number for the  over-the-phone interpretation services and a step-by-step guide of how to access the language line. They will also be  given guidelines for working with interpreters. They will be shown training videos on how to use the DOE translation  and interpretation services.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      As per Chancellor's Regulations A-663 all posters which advertise the availability of translations/interpretations upon  request, are displayed in both the Main Office and the school's foyer. The Language Access ID cards are available in  the Main Office as well as by the security desk. The cards identify the parents/guardians language so that staff  members are made aware of the parent's translation needs. The availability of translation services is announced at  PTA meetings, through school newsletters, and posted announcements in the general office. Our school ensures that  parents are provided with a meaningful opportunity to participate in and have access to programs and services critical  to their child's education.           Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       In order to gather feedback from our parents/guardians on the quality and availability of services we will provide our  parents/guardians with surveys . We want parents to know that their feedback is valued, that their voices are being  heard, and that their concerns about translation services are addressed.  The Language Access Coordinator, Ms. Joana Garcia, will handout a parent survey during parent teacher conferences  in September. This year, the survey will include questions about the parents' experiences with the school's language  services and how these services could be improved.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          120
