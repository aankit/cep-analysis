The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and informed by New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          7     comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement      NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          9        Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Implement at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify   the instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content  standards; provide time for collaboration on the use of) beginning no later than the 2018-19 school year.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.      Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?  Wings Academy is a small, student-centered high school. Our ultimate mission is to prepare students to meet the  challenges of the 21 st century by creating a safe and nurturing environment where all students can achieve their full  potential. We recognize that education is the wind beneath our students’ Wings, and the greatest tool of  empowerment for our society. We are committed to the development of coherent instruction with viable curricula  that are aligned with common core state standards (CCSS) and which will enable our students to become critical  thinkers and effective problem solvers.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, including   a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   To achieve this mission, the school has dedicated educators and staff members whose work ethic and philosophy  represent the core values of the school community: an unwavering commitment to rigor and high academic  standards; experiential and varied instruction; working to improve the community; democratic values; inquiry-based  learning, and effective lesson planning focusing on the CCLS and differentiation.    The key elements of our SCEP are the continued work from our previous SCEP, the use of the Danielson Framework  for Teacher Effectiveness aligned to our CCLS curriculum to drive our professional development and provide  actionable and meaningful feedback to our teachers to improve their instruction. The meaningful conversations held  between administration and teachers clearly impact instruction and the expectations of teachers. Ultimately, we want  to enhance improved attendance, credit accumulation, and graduation through engaging and rigorous curricula.   The theory of action at Wings High School is that students must be actively involved as individuals and in groups to  grapple with real-world problems and how to express their thoughts and ideas while at the same time be prepared to  challenge other people’s thoughts and ideas. Central to this is that students must actively read and practice their  writing to develop college and career skills. To develop our theory of action, our school has actively sought to  implement the Common Core Learning Standards into our curricula and produce performance tasks and rubrics that  allow students to demonstrate their understanding. Then as a school, we have focused on developing specific CCLS  skills such as stating claims and determining appropriate evidence to support these claims.   Strengths, Accomplishments, and Challenges   One of your major accomplishments for last year was working with our students with disabilities and English Language  Learners. In the 2018-19 SCEP, we specifically selected the two most difficult target groups (students with disabilities  and English language learners) in order to provide instruction that met the needs of all of our students. In addition,  we selected the Regents examination (global and integrated algebra) with the lowest passing and weighted passing  percentage so we could focus on building student skills to ensure their success on all high-stakes assessment . In  addition, we worked hard to develop successful ICT collaborations which is a long process that requires extensive  professional development and feedback to the teacher teams.       Our greatest challenge was working with teachers to understand the components of the Danielson Framework and  how that translated into the work they did in their classrooms. Curriculum and instruction needs to be more engaging,  rigorous, and address the needs of all students. In addition, we need to make certain that our students can  demonstrate that students have an understanding of their learning and teachers are continuously checking their  understanding to adjust their instruction as well as the curricula.         2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          11      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Another of our accomplishments was to recruit parents to become actively involved in the school community. So we  worked extremely hard with parents and families to provide need much more timely and targeted  information/progress reports to assist their children they are missing several credits and other graduation  requirements. We identified a transitional counselor to support the ISS department, which has become a positive  addition to the ISS department. In addition, even though the reduction of self-contained classes with the ISS  department has been successful we increased the ICT classes and support the ISS departments, so we are were better  able to cater to the needs of all students. While we did make significant gains in providing more avenues of  communication with our parents and communities, we still understand that we must continue in improving our  parent involvement and engagement data. We still have more work to do in terms of enhancing the tone and climate  of our school so that both students and their families will be more willing to become involved in parent and  community activities, trainings, and meetings.      4.  Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over the   past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Key Areas of Focus for this Year   This year our focus is to continue to develop Rigorous Instruction so that curricula and instruction is coherent and  rigorous and aligned to the CCLS (3.2) which includes more complex materials and stimulates higher order thinking  (3.3), and that teacher’s assess student understanding and capture data that informs instruction and improves  student outcomes (3.5)         Greatest Growth SOP   Our School’s greatest growth came in Tenet 6: Strong Family and Community Ties and specifically in SOP 6.5: The  entire school shares data in a way that empowers and encourages families to use and understand data to promote  dialogue between parents, students and school constituents centered on student learning and success in which our  school was rated Highly Effective. In order to ensure we could effectively improve student performance and outcomes  we needed the full support of all the school’s partners. Thus, we benefited from significant increase in our PAR  attendance and decrease in our ORRS reports. In addition, there was in an increase our parent/family engagement in  which parents more frequently communicated with teachers in terms of their child’s progress and performance.      5.  Identify at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify the   instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content standards;  provide time for collaboration on the use of data) to be implemented in the 2018-19 school year.   We will provide time for collaboration by meeting with departmental heads regularly (discussing the assessment data)  and requiring them to disseminate information to the content teams that will improve and impact instructional goals  according to state academic content standards.            2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 12X684   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   491   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teacher teams with designated leaders review educational research to determine appropriate assessment measures  for each content area as well as the Common Core Learning Standards. Rubrics from CCLS-rich sites such as Engage NY  are adapted and utilized to meet the needs of our mostly ELL population. Formative assessment measures are  reviewed, adapted, and tested in the classrooms, and teacher teams analyze the outcomes for their next steps.  Professional development is an outgrowth of the teacher surveys; observations based on the Danielson Framework  for Teacher Effectiveness , and identified student needs. Instruction and assessment go hand-in-hand, and we spend  considerable time in our professional development to ensure that are assessments are measuring what we are  teaching in the classrooms, content, skills, and process.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet.

Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective  involvement of parents and community in the school. WINGS Academy , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title  I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      WINGS Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          42      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses the NYSELAT pretest to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLS.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   mock NYSELAT and teacher related tests.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The overall success of our program is measured by the quality of instruction delivered by the ESL teacher and other content  area teachers, as observed by the school administration. It is also measured by the increase in our parent participation and  parent involvement in the school through the SLT and PTA. ELLs' academic progress is measured by student transcripts and   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          50         credit accumulation as well as conferencing with ELLs done by the ESL teacher and guidance counselors. We see improvement  in our ELLs English proficiency through year-to-year growth in English proficiency levels.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Monthly meeting with AP to address students' needs and progress.  Adjustments made to schedules during the Fall or Spring  semester.  This information is shared with the teachers for lesson planning adjustment.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   NYSELAT, Mock regents, teacher made exams, regents, data used from the assessment calendar       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Form is provided to the mainstream teachers that provides information about ELLs academic progress.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   At our school, we have both push-in and self-contained models in place. All ELLs, regardless of proficiency level,  receive a self-contained ESL class. The self-contained classes are heterogeneously grouped, with freshmen and  sophomore ELLs in one section of self-contained ESL and junior and senior ELLs in another section of self-contained  ESL. Beginning and Intermediate student receive additional support via a push-in model. The ESL teacher pushes into  students' Social Studies, Math and Science classes, where our ELLs struggle most, for additional support. She will push  in to classes according to the number of ESL support hours the student is entitled to in accordance with CR Part  154.         b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?            Teachers work collaboratively with the ESL teacher, at times planning together the lessons in order to provide additional  support for the ELLs. Teachers meet once a week in inter-departmental teams and twice a week in departmental teams to  complete inquiry work that often supports teachers' work with ELLs. All content area classes are heterogeneous and students  are programmed according to their H.S. year and credit completion .         2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          51      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      The content area classes ELLs take are inclusive general education classes delivered by teachers certified in the content areas.  Instruction is given in English. The self-contained ESL program supports student work in the content area classes of English and  Social Studies. The ESL teacher provides ELLs with support in their other content area classes during push-in periods and  tutoring sessions held during student and teacher free periods. Tutoring is also available after school. Content area teachers  use heterogenous grouping of students during group work to support ELLs. The ESL teacher works with content area teachers  to develop word walls in content area classrooms to support vocabulary acquisition. Teachers in social studies classes teach  students how to annotate readings by modeling the technique and having students practice using annotation while they read  content area texts. Teachers across content areas have begun to teach students vocabulary specific to formal argument and to  ask students to identify details in the text that support claims students are making within the context of the content area. This  instructional focus is aligned with the school’s adoption of the Common Core Learning Standards. These techniques have  enriched ELL language development.   In addition, glossaries designed specifically for ELLs are made available by the ESL teacher for individual student use to further  support the students' native language.          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?    The ESL teacher works with one of the Spanish teachers to administer a Spanish-language diagnostic at the beginning of the  school year to measure Spanish-speaking ELLs proficiency levels in their native language. Currently there are no ELLs with  native languages besides Spanish at the school.             5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Currently, a paraprofessional is used to assit the SIFE, newcomer, developing, and long term students.  In addition, the ESL  teacher pushes in and provides tutoring after school to support these students.    ELLs who have received 4-6 years of ESL services and have shown continual and steady improvement in English Language  proficiency will be monitored to measure whether or not their proficiency continues to improve. Those whose proficiency  levels have plateau ed will be given targeted instruction in the modality in which their NYSESLAT scores are the lowest.  ELLs who have completed 6 years of ESL services will be given targeted instruction in the modality in which their NYSESLAT  scores are the lowest. They will also be given a reading diagnostic, such as the Bader, to give the ESL teacher additional  information about their reading level. These students will be given additional vocabulary and reading comprehension  instruction as necessary.  Former ELLs are given the opportunity to continue in an ESL class in addition to the ELA class that corresponds to their grade  level. Former ELLs are also given extended time on formal assessments, including state and district mandated testing, as well  as the use of glossaries and dictionaries in native languages. The ESL teacher tracks the progress made by ELLs who have  reached proficiency on the NYSESLAT, providing academic support when needed.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The guidance counselors identify who the ELL-SWDs at the school are at the beginning of each school year. They then work  with the ESL teacher and related services teacher to program ELL-SWDs into both ESL and SETSS classes, ensuring that these  students receive all mandated services. ELL-SWDs are often given push-in ESL services in a content area class in addition to  their ESL and SETSS classes. The ESL teacher and related services teacher meet frequently to discuss the needs and progress of  ELL-SWDs. Visuals are used to illustrate vocabulary lessons. Graphic organizers are used to plan writing assignments before  students are asked to complete writing tasks. Pre-reading strategies, such as text-previewing and accessing prior knowledge by   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          52      discussing the themes of texts, are used before read alouds and independent reading. Teachers provide ELL-SWDs with  outlines of notes that can be annotated during direct-instruction.            7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Curricular flexibility is achieved through co-planning between the ESL teacher, the related services and content area teachers.  Teachers are instructionally flexible in designing lessons for ELL-SWDS through differentiating the assessments they assign  students. Students identified as ELL-SWD are scheduled into both self-contained ESL classes and SETSS resource room classes.  This ensures that students are provided with both mandated services. The ESL and related services teachers review IEPs of ELL- SWDs together to discuss what strategies work best to address student academic needs.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.

None     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?       None     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  The guidance counselors identify who the ELL-SWDs at the school are at the beginning of each school year. They then work  with the ESL teacher and related services teacher to program ELL-SWDs into both ESL and SETSS classes, ensuring that these  students receive all mandated services. ELL-SWDs are often given push-in ESL services in a content area class in addition to  their ESL and SETSS classes. The ESL teacher and related services teacher meet frequently to discuss the needs and progress of  ELL-SWDs. Visuals are used to illustrate vocabulary lessons. Graphic organizers are used to plan writing assignments before  students are asked to complete writing tasks. Pre-reading strategies, such as text-previewing and accessing prior knowledge by  discussing the themes of texts, are used before read alouds and independent reading. Teachers provide ELL-SWDs with  outlines of notes that can be annotated during direct-instruction.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Tuwanna Williams Gray, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities  are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          56                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   WINGS Academy HS                                                                              School DBN: 684  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
