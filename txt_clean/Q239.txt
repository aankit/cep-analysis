This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our mission at P.S. 239 is to partner with students, families and the community to foster lifelong learners. Our aim is  to craft instruction that will promote social, emotional and academic development for all students. By doing so, we  hope to educate, empower and enable students to become independent, caring, contributing citizens who can  succeed in an ever-changing world. We focus on high expectations to create a community of respect, determination  and responsibility.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9                     2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 239 is located in Ridgewood, Queens. It is comprised of 572 students from pre-kindergarten through fifth grade.  Our community services both students who are native to the United States, as well as, immigrants from South  America and Asia. We are an inclusive environment that provides special education services to 27% of our students.  Additionally, 26% of our student population currently receives English as a New Language support in order to develop  proficiency of grade level skills.   The staff and parents of PS 239Q work collaboratively to provide students with a well-rounded educational  experience. Students receive instruction in English language arts, mathematics, social studies, science, physical  education, technology, character education and the arts. Parental involvement, via the School Leadership Team, an  active Parent Teachers Association and parent volunteers, support teaching and learning. Parents are kept up to date  on all aspects of their children’s education through monthly newsletters, Parent Teacher’s Association meetings,  parent workshops, social media outlets, as well as parent engagement meetings, workshops and "Breakfast with the  Principal."      In order to support and develop the “whole” student, we melded the SuperYou curriculum to the PBIS system for  behavior intervention. Students identify the "super power" within themselves and create a super hero alter ego.  Behavioral expectations were developed around the traits of responsibility, respect and determination for students to  exemplify in all aspects of their school community life. Students earn "Dzwonek Dollars" and are able to save up for  incentives such as: breakfast with administration, office helper, the ability to purchase prizes from the school store  and more. We have aligned our student of the month awards with character education and classes vote for the  student who most embodies that month’s quality. Our student council engages the entire community in fund raising  efforts throughout the year. In the past, money has been raised for the Cancer Society, American Heart Association  and local food banks to name a few. We foster a commitment to community service. Attendance awards are  presented monthly to encourage students to be present each day. We implemented an attendance initiative "Count  me In," to celebrate and increase attendance.We have incorporated the institution of clubs in grades 4 and 5.  Students participate in clubs such as, gardening, drama, yoga, basketball, gaming, chorus, and LEGO every Friday. This  year ,we will continue our partnership with "Beautiful Me" for our 5th grade female students and "Handsome He" for  our 5th grade male students to further develop the whole child. Along with our school based community organization,  Greater Ridgewood Youth Council, our students are provided with homework help and after school enrichment in the  arts and sports. Additionally, The Boy Scouts of America, work with boys in second through fifth grade.      Currently, all of our teachers are highly qualified in the areas they teach. Ongoing instructional support is provided by  our coach and mentors. This year, we look forward to our continued work with the Borough Field Support Center.      It is our belief that students learn best through quality instruction, where strategies are modeled for students;  students are given the opportunity to try with guided support and then try with their peers, before doing it on their  own. The ultimate goal is that they are able to apply their learning across subjects. In order to facilitate a deeper   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      understanding of content, we utilize Wonders/Ready Writing in ELA and MyMath/Exemplars in math. Our students  engage in high level discussions to increase their understanding of concepts across curricula. Teachers use  information gleaned from these discussions, work samples and assessments to develop entry points and  differentiated tasks. This process assists students in developing an understanding of grade level materials, which in  turn raises their level of success. We provide RTI services to at-risk students. We utilize a "Talk Ladder" for both  teachers and students to track participation and response levels during class discussions. Our students use this system  to set personal goals for discussions and then assess their level of participation. This year we will begin the inclusion  of the "3Ls" strategies to increase understanding of complex texts and content.       Professional development for our staff is on-going. We will once again utilize a survey to develop an initial  professional development plan. We will continue to monitor the efficacy of our professional development through  observations and utilize the data gleaned from Advance to tailor professional development to meet the needs of our  staff and hence, positively impact instruction and student outcomes.      Collaborative professional learning teams work to analyze student work samples and adjust units of study to increase  student growth. This intensive and ongoing support provides our pedagogical staff with the necessary tools and skills  to positively impact student progress and performance. From this analysis, we will be able to identify the gaps in our  instructional program. Once these gaps are identified, teams will work to determine proven strategies to supplement  our curriculum. These strategies will be implemented and then re-evaluated for their effectiveness. If necessary,  modifications will be made to ensure that students are successful and continuing to make gains.      We will continue to work with all stakeholders in our community to sustain and further build a culture of trust and  mutual respect.          3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   In 239Q, 27% of our student population have IEPs and require related services such as speech, physical therapy and  occupational therapy. In addition, they require scaffolds and differentiated instruction in small groups. Teachers  utilize sentence frames, visual and verbal prompts, teachers also develop vocabulary through the use of "shades of  meaning" and other word play activities in order to assist students in accessing curriculum. Our school community is  also comprised of 26% English Language Learners. They too, require scaffolds and differentiated instruction in small  groups. Teachers utilize similar strategies to ensure that students have entry points into the content.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   We were most successful in achieving our goal for social emotional curricula under 5B Supportive Environment. We  were able to ensure that 100% of our students engaged in character development . Once again, we blended SuperYou  and PBIS to create a curriculum that nutured the whole child. We were complimented by the creator of SuperYou,  Lourdes Lane, at our culminating event for creating a culture that embodies the vision of self reflection to build self- esteem and citizenship. In order to further develop the whole child we continued with "Beautiful Me" program and  piloted the "Handsome He" program. Exemplary students were asked to participate in the "Suarez Squad" to build  their leadership and citizenship skills. As a result of this work, suspensions decreased to 1 during the school year.    Our key area of focus for the 2018-2019 school year, will continue to revolve around writing.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 24Q239   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   564   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

During the 2017-2018 school year, we utilized Wonders texts to develop writing tasks that began with a pre  assessment so that teachers could develop units based on student's needs and culminated with a post assessment to  determine growth. Although, our goal was met, we know that there is more work to do in this area. New York State  assessment data indicated a 7.7% growth in students receiving a 3 or 4. However, only 37.6% of our students  acheived a 3 or 4. Post assessment data indicated that students are able to effectively write essay within specific  units but, fail to recall genre specific concepts outside those units. This year we will continue to utilize Readywriting  strategies to compliment Wonders curriculum. We will infuse 3L strategies, such as sentence frames to assist  students in developing their ideas.

Although we were somewhat successful in providing the school communities of IS 77, PS 88, PS 68 and PS 239 with  inclusive social/workshops events. We continue to believe that parents in general, need to know that schools not only  support their children’s growth but, can support their needs as well. Schools can and should be considered a resource  for families. We firmly believe that an increase in intra-school parental involvement will better support our student’s  academic and social growth, increase parent’s capacity and expose parents to the programs offered by schools in  Ridgewood, hence positively affecting enrollment.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  Incoming Pre-Kindergarten, Kindergarten students and their parents are invited to participate in a transition  orientation session to explain school wide policies and learn about school services and how best to support their  children as they transition to our school community. Parents of students who require ENL screening are invited to be  interviewed by an ENL department member who will also explain the program choices available to them so that they  can make an informed decision for their children. After watching the parent orientation video, parents are asked to  complete the parent survey and selection form. An ENL department member will administer the NYSITELL to those  students who are eligible.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.        All students are administered the Wonders benchmark assessment to determine a student’s comprehension and  fluency levels. An evaluation of student data from end of each unit along with NYS assessment data is used to inform  decisions for the formation of small groups, RTI groups and early morning and after school programs.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36        Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student  achievement. The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure  effective involvement of parents and community in the school. P.S. 239Q, in compliance with the Section 1118  of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning  and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively  participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained  volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities.  The school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent  involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the  evaluation through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively  meet the needs of parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by  the school.   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of  the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School  Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their  members for additional input.

Program (Tuesday and Thursday) 2:30PM-3:30PM    The funds will be used to run an After School Program both ELL and immigrant students to  build ELA skills.    Data from our end of year assessments in ELA indicated that 15/19 first grade students are not  reading on grade level in June of 2018.  As these students will be our second grade students in  the 2018-2019 school year, we will  invite struggling ELLs, as well as immigrant students, to  attend an after school program to build their literacy skills so that they will be reading on grade  level in June 2019.   The program will be facilitated by a an ENL teacher two days a week during February and  March.  Students will use the ELL edition of Wonders  by McGraw-Hill  and New York  Content Reading for 2nd grade by Continental Press to build their comprehension capacity and  reading skills.  Content Reading and Writing will be purchased for this sole purpose.   Wonders  ELL edition materials can be accessed online at no cost to us.  The ENL Wonders materials are  not used during the The teacher will assign specific resources to students, tailored to their  individual needs.  Instruction will be in English only, but there are other language supports (such  as Spanish translation) built into the program to scaffold learning.  Students can improve their  fluency and comprehension with student recordings and constructed response  opportunities.  Students will also be motivated by incentives and rewards.  The resources are  printable and projectable using our Promethean board technology.    In addition to the After School Program, all ELL and immigrant students will be  provided  leveled books and resources to support reading development at school and at  home.  The content is standards-aligned and can be differentiated for each student.  Books will  be purchased for this sole purpose.

These workshop will be taught by a fully  certified ENL teacher.  The duration of each session will be 45 minutes.  We will provide parents  with approximately 10 workshops.  Each will be geared to aide parents in assisting their children  build their academic skills.  A parent survey will be sent to all parents 2 times during the year in  order to determine parent interests.  Using information gleaned from past surveys, we will  prepare workshops to train parents in the use of manipulatives and learn the 4 step model of  problem solving.  They will also be trained in strategies to assist their children with homework,  reading strategies, and the use of Thinking Maps to organize ideas.  Several sessions will be  conducted in the computer lab to familiarize them with technology resources such as EngageNY,  and Wonders and My Math online components to support their students’ academic  learning.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?     1. Our school uses running records and Wonders performance assessments to assess and track our students in reading.  The  data gleaned from these assessments has revealed that we need to provide our students with more early reading  intervention.   The majority of ENL students are reading below grade level.  This data from our running record  analysis specifically indicated that students struggle with phonemic awareness which causes interference in students' fluency  and comprehension.  Additionally, the use of benchmark writing assessments in ReadyWriting indicated that ENL students lack  the ability to effectively utilize text based evidence in their writing.  Furthermore, ENL students at the Expanding level struggle  with writing complex sentences.  Our Wonders performance assessment data indicates that ENL students continue to struggle  with determining the main idea of a text and using context clues to determine the meaning of words.  In addition, the  assessment data for our Entering and Emerging students reveals that their vocabulary skills in the new language need to be   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      developed.          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   In order to assist students in the development of phonemic awareness and usage, teachers will utilize Spire Sound Sensibility  along with Wonders phonics activities in small groups and during independent work time.  We will use Spire Sound Sensibility  and other computer-based programs to assist students in their development of phonemic awareness.   Additionally, both  classroom and ENL teachers are using guided reading and close reading of texts to assist ENL students in the development of  comprehension strategies, hence, building their ability to  understand texts.  The guided reading books that we use are  differentiated based on level (below grade-level, on grade-level, above grade-level, and ELL) and aligned to the classroom  curriculum, in order to reinforce the skills, strategies, and vocabulary being taught during whole group instruction.  Through  the use of Thinking Maps, students will be able to focus their responses to ensure that they use relevant text-based evidence  when required.  In conjunction with Thinking Maps, students will use sentence frames and paragraph frames to be able to  formulate written responses.  We will implement Hochman writing strategies to build students' skills in writing complex  sentences.  We will focus small group instruction around strategy lessons targeting the reading skills of determining the main  idea and using context clues.  For our Entering and Emerging students, ENL teachers provide vocabulary support and  scaffolding that align to the units of study taking place in the classroom.  Finally, students in K-2 are receiving RtI small group  support.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our school uses running records, Wonders performance assessments, as well as NYS assessment data to assess and track our  students in reading and writing.  These assessments are given three times during the school year.  First, in October, we  administer an initial baseline assessment.  Based on those results, ELLs are struggling with phonemic awareness, determining  the main idea, using context clues, using relevant text evidence to support ideas, and writing complex sentences.  Next, we  will administer the same assessments in January and May to track student growth and determine continued areas of need  across the year.  The focus of small group instruction will be modified based on the results of these ongoing assessments.  The  running records assist us in determining the independent and instructional levels for our students.  Wonders assessments  assist us in determining phonemic awareness, fluency, comprehension, sight word recognition and writing skills.  This data is  analyzed periodically by administration and teachers during data meetings.  Additionally, teachers administer post unit  assessments in reading, writing and math to develop and/or make modifications to instructional plans and practices.   We  analyze the results and growth made using the ELL Data Analysis Tool, and the results and growth made on formal  assessments, such as the New York State ELA and Mathematics Assessments.  An analysis of the EDAT reveals a significant  number of ELLs scored at or below the 25th growth percentile and scored at a Level 1 or 2 on the ELA/Math.  Additionally, a  number of ELLs have been identified as at-risk of becoming long-term ELLs and have also scored at a Level 1 or 2 on the  ELA.  We have identified these ELLs and will target them for small group instruction based on their areas of needs according to  the summative assessments.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We use the results of the summative data to identify students that would benefit from afterschool and enrichment  programs.  These students are also targeted for small group instruction in which the areas of need are addressed.  We use  Thinking Maps and Hochman writing strategies to develop students' skills in using relevant text-based evidence and writing  complex sentences.  In addition, we use strategy lessons to strengthen students' reading skills in determining main idea and  using context clues.  To address students' phonemic awareness skills, we are utilizing Spire Sound Sensibility and Wonders  phonics activities.  Furthermore, our ENL staff uses a co-teaching intergrated ENL model to meet the needs of our ELLs.  Both  classroom teachers and ENL staff use differentiated guided reading and phonemic awareness activities to increase fluency and  comprehension.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         The RtI team at our school meets monthly.   During these meetings we discuss and review students across all grade levels that  are receiving RtI interventions and/or are being recommended for Tier II/Tier III interventions including our ELL students.    Tier  II interventions are provided by trained personnel (i.e. Leveled Literacy Specialist/SETSS teacher) outside the classroom for fifty  minute sessions, two to five times per week based on the student's grade level.  Interventions utilized include Spire Sound  Sensibility which focuses on phonological awareness and beginning phonics instruction for struggling readers.  In addition,  interventions used are visual ait to support instruction, use of manipulative materials, and graphic organizers.  Tier III  interventions are provided by our ENL and Special Education teachers who work with individual students in all grades outside  the classroom three times per week for forty-five minute sessions.  Interventions used include using modified curriculum  materials and providing individualized skills-based instruction.  Additionally, the administration, ENL staff and classroom  teachers meet 3 times a year to discuss data collected from Wonders assessments, math topic test data, benchmark tasks, and  teacher conference notes.  Interventions and participation of students in RtI are discussed and evaluated.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Assessment data that we use to evaluate and inform ELL programs are based on the NYSESLAT results.  Overall, our NYSESLAT  data from 2016-2017 indicates that 33% (48/142) of our ELLs demonstrated progress and moved up one or more proficiency  levels.     47 of our students have been identified as being Commanding in English.  The majority of these students were ELLs in  kindergarten.    Our data also reveals that 38 of our students did not move up at least one overall proficiency level.  The majority of them were  Expanding ELLs students in grades 3 through 5.      The data also revealed that 7 of our students moved down one proficiency level.       Upon further analysis, 2 ELLs scored at or below 25th growth percentile and scored at level 1 or 2 on the ELA; 7 ELLs scored at  or below the 25th growth percentile and scored at level 1 or 2 on Math; 8 ELLs have been held over in the past 3 years; 27  ELLs are at-risk Level 3 or greater; 8 ELLs are at-risk Level 5 or greater; and, 8 ELLs are in their 5th or 6th years of service.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teachers analyze the EDAT in conjunction with the RLAT to identify areas of need in individual student performance,  as well as across grade levels and grade bands.  They share their findings with classroom teachers to inform their instruction  based on this data analysis.  In addition, this data analysis is used to inform student grouping for the ENL program.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.

Administration programs the  four ENL teachers to ensure that the mandated instructional periods are provided according to proficiency level.  One  ENL teacher services of all Kindergarten and Grades 1 through 5 are serviced by three ENL teachers.  The students are  heterogeneously grouped with English dominant students to allow students to hear and converse with native  language speakers of English.  However, within these classes the students are grouped by proficiency levels in order to  maximize ENL teacher services.  One common prep a week has also been built into their schedules so that the ENL  teachers can collaborate with classroom teachers for planning purposes and discuss specific students’ needs.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.      N/A    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              2. Entering and Emerging students receive 180 minutes a week of integrated ENL instruction with an emphasis on  differentiating the Literacy content area instruction, as well as 180 minutes a week of standalone ENL instruction with an  emphasis on speaking, listening, and language development.  Transitioning and Expanding students receive 180 minutes a  week of integrated ENL instruction with an emphasis on differentiating the Literacy content area instruction.  Commanding  students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL instruction with an emphasis on continuing the growth of their language  development in reading and writing for an additional two years.     Home language support is present in our ENL program through the use of home language texts for cross-cultural learning,  realia, dictionaries/glossaries, visual aids, and partnerships between ELLs of the same home language to support them  academically and socially as members of our school community.          3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      3.  During the literacy block, our ENL teachers support students using a push-in model to provide integrated ENL instruction  using the Wonders curriculum.  ENL teachers utilize the differentiated materials and strategies within this curriculum to meet  the needs of our students.  Specifically, ENL teachers use Thinking Maps consistently to help students make connections in  learning and organize information.  Additionally, ENL teachers use tiered questioning in order allow all students to access the  text, participate meaningfully, and make content comprehensible.  During the second block of literacy, ENL teachers support  students using small group instruction, including guided reading, strategy lessons, and conferences.  This also includes  presenting core content through the use of technology, such as having students listen to an audio version of texts and  complete graphic organizers interactively via SmartBoard technology.  This provides multiple entry points for different types of  learners.  During the third block of literacy, ENL teachers support students using the Ready Writing curriculum which utilizes a  step by step approach to creating genre-based writing pieces.  During the literacy periods, the ENL teachers provide students  with small-group instruction using a variety of lesson structures, including cooperative group learning, class discussion, close  reading and independent application.  This supports learning in the four modalities of English as they learn new literacy skills  and strategies.  The ENL teachers also incorporate shared writing and interactive writing during strategy lessons to enrich  language development for Entering and Emerging students.  Strategy lessons for Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding  students focus on organization and development.  Further, a modified guided reading approach is utilized. This is an  interactive approach to improve comprehension and affords students the opportunity to listen as the teacher models fluency  by reading aloud the text.  Further, the teacher presents the culturally-relevant text through a group discussion connecting the  content and language structure to the students’ personal lives through the use of realia and conducting a picture walk.  During  all ELA instruction, the ENL teachers scaffold learning via visuals, realia, TPR, and graphic organizers.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      4.  Our ELL students are appropriately evaluated in their home language through the Spanish LAB as well as formal NYS  assessments which are offered in the students' home languages, if available.  We also provide glossaries/bilingual dictionaries  as instructional supports during the school day and, if necessary, for their use on informal/formal assessments.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    5.  Instruction is differentiated for the following subgroups:     5a.  Initially, we identify students using the SIFE Oral Interview Questionnaire, followed by the Multilingual Literacy SIFE  Screener and the Writing Pre-Screener, if needed.  Our instructional plan for SIFE students will incorporate intervention and  emotional support from our guidance counselor.  These students will receive the mandated number of minutes per week of  ENL instruction based on their proficiency level and in accordance with NYS CR Part 154.  We will provide the students with a  supplementary reading intervention program based on their reading needs during the school day, which would be in addition  to them receiving ENL services based on their proficiency level.       5b. The ELLs in our school that are here less than three years (newcomers) receive the mandated number of minutes per week  of ENL instruction based on their proficiency level and in accordance with NYS CR Part 154.  Emotional support is provided by  our guidance counselor to help them effectively embrace our school culture during the month of September.  During the  standalone ENL instruction, ENL teachers conduct author studies, use Thinking Maps to develop vocabulary and reading skills,  create ENL centers with activities that newcomers can successfully complete independently in the classroom, accompanied by  thematic projects and culminating activities.    5c. Our 4-6 year Developing ELLs receive the mandated number of minutes per week of ENL instruction based on their  proficiency level and in accordance with NYS CR Part 154.  Within the mandated instructional time these students receive  small group instruction in writing, which has been identified as their major area of weakness. Further, strategy lessons are  conducted daily to address their individual writing goals.  These goals strongly emphasize elaboration, maintaining focus, and  writing complex sentences.      5d. Long-Term ELLs would receive the mandated number of minutes per week of ENL instruction based on their proficiency  level and in accordance with NYS CR Part 154.  We would provide these students with a supplementary intervention program  to support their reading needs based on their reading levels, using the supplementary intervention in Wonders and  ReadyWriting, depending on the students' grade and reading level.       5e. Former ELLs are monitored closely and on an as-needed basis may continue to receive the mandated number of minutes  per week of ENL instruction based on their academic/language needs.   These students also receive supplementary reading  intervention to support their reading needs based on their reading levels.  The supplementary intervention in Wonders and  ReadyWriting, depending on their grade and reading level. Lastly, they are provided with the testing accommodations that are  allowable by the state and are used consistently throughout the school year.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   6. Our classroom teachers have been trained to employ a variety of ENL strategies to make content comprehensible to enrich  language development and differentiate learning for ELL students.  The following are some of the instructional approaches and  methods that are utilized: preteaching new vocabulary, visual support and realia, technology tools, such as presenting lessons  on Promethean boards, interactive writing, shared reading/writing, graphic organizers, writing prompts, flexible grouping  based on academic needs and language support, use of manipulatives, real-life experiences and field trips.  In mathematics,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      the students are also provided with math materials in their native language.  Our school library also offers a wide selection of  native language literature to support content area instruction.  Teachers of ELL-SWDs use grade-level materials aligned with the Common Core and utilize instructional strategies to make  complex texts accessible to all students, such as reading comprehension days prior to having students answer and discuss close  reading text-dependent questions.  The grade-level materials that teachers use are Wonders curriculum which includes close  reading grade-level texts in an anthology textbook, and a Your Turn book which includes additional grade-level texts to  practice the skills and strategies taught during whole group instruction.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school employs curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least  restrictive environment by providing a variety of supports.  In terms of scheduling flexibility, we use the co-teaching  integrated model to meet the needs of ELL-SWDs.  My Math includes intervention components which are incorporated into  math instructional periods throughout the week.  Guided Reading and strategy lessons are additional curricular supports that  also facilitate the diverse needs of these students in all content areas.  In terms of curricular flexibility, differentiated texts are  used and grade-level texts are presented in a variety of ways, including through audio presentation, rereading of complex  texts, and using tiered questioning.  Teachers use instructional flexibility to meet the needs of their ELL-SWDs, including  through the use of Readers Theater, Project Based Learning, Clubs which are based on student choice, and monthly grade  performances.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  In Grades K-2, our RtI Literacy Specialist provides phonics, phonemic awareness, and fluency intervention for the following  targeted ELL subgroup:  Expanding and Commanding ELLs.  All instruction is in English, with home language support provided.     In Grades 3-5 our RtI Math Specialist provides intervention focused on numeric fluency, place value, and deciphering word  problems, through the use of manipulatives, math games, and station learning, for the following targeted ELL  subgroup:  ELLs who scored at a Level 1 or 2 on the NYS Math exam and ELLs who are at-risk of becoming Long-Term ELLs.  All  instruction is in English, with home language support provided.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on trends found in baseline assessments, summative assessments, and data from the EDAT, we have found that that  ELLs continue to struggle with the writing modality on the NYSESLAT, ELA, and in the written portions of math exams.  This  includes writing complex sentences, using relevant text-based evidence, and formulating a claim which adequately answers  the question.  Therefore, we are now incorporating Hochman writing techniques to improve ELLs' writing skills in these  areas.  Another new program/improvement is the use of ReadyWriting in grades 3-5 which provide students with step-by-step  instructions on creating genre-based writing pieces.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Equal access to all school programs is granted to our ELL students to promote their academic success.  Our ELLs (0-3 years)  benefit from receiving our Title III Afterschool Program, which incorporates Ready Writing, the Writing Revolution and Thinking  Maps.  These intervention programs are all conducted in English.  Our Developing ELLs (4-6 years) also have access to these  intervention programs.  Our Long-Term ELLs (completed 6 years) receive priority for all of the intervention programs above,  and receive guidance support, if needed.  Our ELLs are invited to all school programs including afterschool arts programs and Title III afterschool programs through   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      letters sent to the parents in the parents' preferred language.  All ELLs are invited and fully participate in these  programs.  ELLs are prioritized to participate in Boy Scouts and the Greater Ridgewood Youth Council afterschool programs.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The instructional materials used to support our ELLs (0-3 years, 4-6 years, and those that completed six years) during Reading  and Writing periods and all content area instruction include the following: visuals, realia, math manipulatives, bilingual/picture  dictionaries, maps and charts, video/DVD collections, graphic organizers, and hands-on science materials.  Our literacy  curriculum, Wonders has a comprehensive website through which students listen and read along to close reading texts,  through the use of Promethean Boards.  Wonders also has many interactive grammar games.  The texts in Wonders also have  information on Spanish cognates which students learn about and listen to through the website presentation. In addition, many  classrooms are equipped with Promethean which are also used for math instruction.  A schoolwide subscription to  BrainPOP allows students to build background knowledge through its extensive video collection.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In our ENL program, home language support is delivered through peer-partnerships in literacy periods with students of the  same home language.  Current, age-appropriate literature is provided in ELLs' home languages.  Bilingual and picture  dictionaries, realia and graphic organizers, and technology support are also integrated to support language growth.  In  mathematics, My Math materials in Spanish are utilized to provide home language support.  Our school library gives our  students access to a variety of home language literature.  Further, our teachers provide home language support, if available, by  translating the content to serve as a scaffolding technique, when necessary.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All of the materials are grade level appropriate and the students are grouped by grade level when they receive intervention  support.  Our newcomer ELLs (0-3 years of service) that are in the upper grades (3-5) are supported with materials that are low  level/high interest, based on their reading levels and their reading interests.  Wonders curriculum has leveled readers specific  to ELL instruction so that ELLs are reading the same text as their peers, which is high interest and age-appropriate, but with  slight modifications, such as less complex sentence structures and additional vocabulary to preteach.   ELL-SWDs are taught using the Wonders curriculum from the grade below their grade level so that instructional materials are  appropriate to their cognitive needs but are still engaging and age-appropriate.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A (we do not share a building)     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   We provide a Jumpstart Kindergarten Orientation Session in June facilitated by the Parent Coordinator that is designed to  inform parents of incoming kindergarten students about our school and its programs.  We review parent surveys and program  selection forms to determine trends of parental choice for program offerings.  Our guidance counselor also meets with all  newly enrolled ELL students to provide them with social support and to introduce them to peers of their home language from  other classes or set them up with a home language buddy in their same class.  New ELLs who enroll throughout the school year  are encouraged to attend Tuesday Tea with their parents to meet with administration during Parent Engagement time on a  monthly basis. Newly enrolled ELLs and their parents are also invited to Parent Workshops throughout the year to provide  them with strategies for completing homework and preparing for state exams.  ELL students are introduced to member of the  PTA to provide a connection to the school community and learn about additional resources.          17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We do not have language electives because this program option is not applicable in the elementary schools.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54            18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  ENL teachers attend workshops provided by the Queens North Borough Field Support Center.  Such workshops include the  series - Scaffolding Language, Learning and Literacy for ELLS as well as NYSESLAT Training for scoring.  Each workshop provides  an opportunity to collaborate with other pedagogues throughout the district.  Teachers share best practices, are updated on  compliance information and are given new strategies to help support ELL learning.  Teachers who attend workshops offered by  the Borough Field Office turnkey the information to the other ENL teachers, classroom teachers of ELLs, and administrators.     Classroom teachers of ELLs and administrators will continue to attend off-site professional development sessions offered by  the Division of English Language Learners and Student Support to support their professional growth and provide a  differentiated approach to the classroom curriculum. All teachers receive a minimum of 15% of the required professional  development hours dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and  integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.     All ENL teachers receive a minimum of 50% of the required professional development hours dedicated to language acquisition,  including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English  language learners.      Professional development offered to teachers of ELLs in supporting ELLs as they engage in the CCLS include literacy coaching  focused on ENL strategies, professional development days focused on making complex texts accessible to all learners, and  grade level planning days to develop questioning on complex texts that include scaffolded/bridging questions.                 2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our guidance counselor meets with all teachers of fifth grade ELLs to provide them vital information so that they can make  informed decisions regarding middle school and avails herself to clarify questions and follow-up with middle school issues that  may arise on an individual basis.      Our entire school staff, which includes administration, literacy coach, ENL teachers, common branch and special education  teachers, paraprofessionals, guidance counselor, all related service providers, secretaries and parent coordinator that work  with ELLs will receive professional development in order to fulfill the 15% of total hours for all teachers and 50% of total hours  for ENL teachers.  Professional Development days from September through January will be conducted by members of  administration to address research-based strategies to promote academic literacy, questioning and discussion techniques, and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         integrated literacy through Wonders, our literacy curriculum.  We also have in-house mentors and instructional lead teachers  who provide consistent support and professional development to all teachers.  From February to June, our focus will be on  testing accommodations to make assessments more comprehensible for ELLs and curriculum development to promote  differentiation for ELLs during mathematics workshop.  All agendas, attendance sheets, minutes, and handouts for these  sessions are filed in-house and are accessible to all staff.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   ENL teachers individually contact parents of ELLs in the parents' preferred language to schedule individual parent meetings at  least once a year to discuss the goals of the program, their child's language development progress, their child's English  language proficiency assessment result, and language development needs in all content areas.  These parent meetings take  place during parent engagement time or at other times depending on the parents' availability to meet.  These meetings  include all staff necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the child's language development in all content  areas.  ENL teachers keep logs of the annual parent meetings.     Once a month on Tuesdays during Parent Engagement time, parents are invited to attend Tuesday Tea with members of  administration and teachers.  During this time, parents are able to open up dialogue regarding current school programs and  offerings.      ELL parents are also invited to Parent Workshops throughout the year to provide them with strategies for completing  homework and preparing for state exams.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   2.  Each ENL teacher maintains Communication Logs to track meetings, phone calls, and letters to ELL parents documenting  annual individual meetings to discuss the goals of the program, their child's language development progress, their child's  English language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas.         3. Specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs include a School/Family Carnival, Parent Reading  Night, Lunch & Learn session, Adult ENL classes, Student vs Staff Basketball Tournament ad dadditional school events.  Parents  are also invited to Arts Connection Performances, including theater, chorus, and puppetry culminating events.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Michele Dzwonek, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PO Ramon Suarez School                                                                              School DBN: 24Q239  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
