This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      We envision our school as a collaborative community of learners. Our learning community addresses the individual  needs and learning styles of all students, while maintaining and enriching a nurturing and supportive environment.  We are a diverse collaborative school community dedicated to achieving high standards of academic excellence for all  our students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Strength: According to low inference data from classroom observations as measured by the Danielson   Framework, teachers practice explicit instruction by setting clear goals and expectations prior to performance   assessment tasks. Teachers and students collaborate to design student-friendly performance task rubrics.   With teacher guidance, students define characteristics of good [writing, speaking, persuading, entertaining,   etc.] Subsequently, students are able to use the posted rubric to incorporate those features into their own   authentic work and engage in both peer and self-evaluation.   Strength: Our teacher teams collaborate to modify the Common-Core Aligned EngageNY Curriculum. They design or   modify performance assessment tasks, which measure the students’ progress on major learning standards.   Modified performance tasks are designed to maximize the efficacy of the assessment in measuring the   learning of each individual student. For example, teachers incorporate student choice and identify both   accommodations and modifications that can be made for diverse learners.   Strength: Teachers and students engage in weekly conferences to create or progress monitor academic goals.   Students complete self-evaluation form and modify goal(s) when deemed appropriate. These goals include   IEP Goals, needs identified on baseline data from fall assessments, and student-identified areas of interest   and need.   * Need: According to Written Feedback from PPO dated 12/21/17, Superintendent and Principal agreed that   student engagement presents as a weakness, indicating that at times students were “waiting for instruction   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      from the teacher or to be given their own assignment.” In addition to implementing our School Improvement   Plan, which focuses on lesson pacing and student engagement, we need to provide professional development   on classroom routines and structures that foster student independence in initiating and persisting through   academic tasks such as writing.   * Need: According to the 2017 New York State English Language Arts Exam Item Analysis, our students   demonstrate a relative weakness in the writing of constructed responses. Specifically, our students   demonstrate deficits in the following skills: writing conventions, paragraph structure, word tense, sentence   structure, and supporting a statement with details from a text.   * Need: According to the 2017 NYS ELA Exam Item Analysis and the Fountas and Pinnell Reading Assessment   given two times a year, our students present with deficits in knowledge of grade level and content area   vocabulary. Also, our students demonstrate a weakness in the ability to use inferencing skills and prior   knowledge (such as cognates, prefixes, suffixes, and roots) to understand new or unfamiliar words.   * Need: According to In-Class Observations and the 2017 NYS ELA Exam Item Analysis, our students struggle   with stamina and both the commencement and completion of more rigorous writing tasks such as those   present on the New York State English Language Arts Test.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?         Strength: We provide a range of classroom settings for students on the Autism Spectrum (6:1:1, 8:1:1, 12:1:1).  We provide them with the most appropriate level of support to meet their individual goals. Our teams track  student progress holistically to ensure that students demonstrate proficiency in all developmental domains  before moving to a less restrictive setting. We provide opportunities for students to move to less restrictive  environments. These environments offer greater rigor and foster the practice of more advanced  communication skills through peer interaction. Our more restrictive settings emphasize Adaptive Daily Living  Skills as well as the basic communication skills of initiation and discrimination in order to promote student  independence and prepare them for less restrictive environments.    Strength: This year, we provided three professional development sessions to faculty on Student Functional  Communication including Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) and interpreting ABLLS (The  Assessment of Basic Language Learner Skills). In our weekly Professional Learning Communities, teams  analyzed lessons and student work samples with a focus on building in opportunities for students to generate  competency at their individual level of communication.            Need: Based on the Principal’s Performance Observation visit, December 21, 2017, it was observed that some  students were not fully engaged in instruction. There was no evidence of teacher-generated opportunities to  foster meaningful interactions between students.     Need: Observations and feedback from Principal’s Performance Observation visit on December 21, 2017,   reflect the need for a comprehensive school improvement plan with clear goals and data-driven assessments  that support next steps toward functional communication skills to support and track growth in this domain.     Need: Based on the SANDI and ABLLS assessments, many students are scoring at the "early learner" stage in   their ability to initiate communication.     Need: Based on the SANDI data, the majority of our students are a scoring 0-2 using “wh” questions to   request information. Teacher observations reflect that students need prompting to comment and request  information during lessons and to problem solve throughout the school day.     Need: An analysis of data taken from the Student Annual Needs Inventory (SANDI) indicates that although our   students increased their communication skills by an average of 16 points over the 2017-2018 school year ,  students lacked more advanced skills in requesting information or attention.      Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under- credited, SIFE, STH).      Teachers and speech providers will conduct a Communication  Assessment, as well as an Interest Inventory to determine entry  points for teaching and highly motivating reinforcement.   Administration will meet with Speech and Language  pathologists to communicate plan and organize the  collaboration between speech therapists and classroom  teachers.   Through professional development and within our professional  learning communities we will focus on the stages of  communication that move children towards functional  communication. The “how” students communicate will be  explored with a focus on professional development in the usage  of the Picture Exchange Communication system.   Using Preferred Method of Communication (PMC) i.e., Mayer  Johnson symbols, communication devices, scripting and  spontaneous language, teachers will be expected to engage  students at their present level of communication during all  activities throughout the school day.    Teachers will provide naturalistic teaching moments and  training in everyday environments such as:   Activities that take place throughout the day, rather than only  at “therapy time.”   Preferred toys and activities are included so that participation  in activities is self-reinforcing.   Referencing Student Interest Inventory to determine highly  motivated items or objects for use during training within each  stage.

The Functional Communication Learning Plan consists of six  stages wherein teaching with prompting then prompt fading  occur. After the teaching of each stage of communication, the  student enters a transition phase in which the teacher  eliminates prompting. Quantitative observational data  measuring student independence at that phase of  communication will indicate readiness for the next stage of  communication. Teachers and/or paraprofessionals and  students will track student progress on our Stages of  Communication Continuum.   Color coded charts representing the various stages of  communication will be present in all classrooms.

Strength: Common planning and prep times occur on a weekly basis allowing teachers the opportunity to learn about  different styles, classroom environment procedures, and set up. In collaboration, Coordinators, lead teachers and  school leaders will conduct professional learning sessions, class team collaborative meetings and select inter-visitation  protocols, as well as continually ask for staff feedback, in order to build investment and familiarity of the practice with  their school community.    Strength: Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) occur on a weekly basis. These meetings center around analyzing  data to inform instruction and creating plans for improving pacing and student engagement.    Strength: Professional development (PD) is planned as a result of questions that arise during, PLCs. We continue to  use ADVANCE to aggregate data in order to show teacher progress related to targeted professional development.   Need: Based on NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School Effectiveness which showed that in Tenet 4 Teacher Practices and  Decisions, our school is performing at stage 3 out of 4, indicating potential for growth.

Strengths:    P811M has been and is committed to enhancing parent immersion and engagement in school programs, events and  various meetings to sustain and promote student achievement. We believe that parent support is vital to student  success, second only to teacher quality.   School Quality Guide from 2017-18:   -98% of families say that school staff regularly communicate with them about how families can help their child learn.  (City Average 93%)  -99% of families say that they are greeted warmly when they call or visit their school. (City Average 96%)    -99% of families say that teachers work closely with them to meet their child's needs. (City Average 94%)    Needs:    According to the School Quality Guide from 2017-18, 97% of families say that they feel well-informed by the  communications they receive from their school. While this is a higher satisfaction rate than the city overall (93%), it is  a relative weakness for our organization.      Therefore it behooves us as a strong school community with parents, to encourage and expand our school-parent  community partnerships even more as we embrace the elements captured in the Chancellor’s Capacity Framework for  meeting student independence, lifelong learning and the demands of college and career readiness.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P811M The Mickey Mantle School,, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students  P811M The Mickey Mantle School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Students to staff ratios are 12:1:1,  8:1:1, and 6:1:1. The integrated model is used to assist students across curricular areas, and  allows them to remain in the classroom with their English-speaking peers. Additionally, it  provides the opportunity for the ENL and classroom teachers to plan instruction and set high  academic goals in the target language. As a result, the English Language Learners (ELLs) are  given the opportunity to acquire the English language across all subject areas. The NYS certified  ENL teacher provides content area instruction in English aligned with the Common Core  Learning Standards (CCLS), and the New Language Arts Progression (NLAP) using ENL  methodologies, strategies and differentiated instruction.        The ENL teacher plans lessons that are based on the students' proficiency level, learning  styles and individual needs. The instructional approaches and methodologies used to make  content areas comprehensible in order to enrich language development are: Balanced Literacy,  Cooperative Learning, Whole Language Instruction and the Learning Experience Approach.       811M's Title III supplemental instructional After-School program titled "Celebrating  Traditions and Multicultural Art" will be conducted in English and serve 8 students in grades 4-6  with an 8:1:1 ratio at our P.S. 811 Main site. The program will run from December 2018 through  June 2019, for 21 sessions, on Wednesdays for 3 hours (from 3:05-6:05pm). A  paraprofessional will provide instructional support.  An administrator will supervise the program  and receive compensation for 3 hours each session. His regular work hours end at 3:00pm.  Students will use background knowledge of their home countries' food, music and art to engaged  in activities that will allow them to explore traditions, art and multicultural celebrations. The  eight students participating in the program scored at the Entering level on the NYSESLAT 2018.      Parents will be invited to participate in the program alongside their children.  This  collaboration will allow parents to provide information about art and specific cultural  traditions/celebrations of their countries. In addition to improving their listening, reading,  writing, speaking skills, students will use computers to conduct research that will foster a greater  understanding of the world around them.  Research supports the use of the arts as a key conduit to learning. Noted research by (Bassano  and Christison, 1982, Franklin, 1989; Richardson, 1990; Shier, 1990) advocate the need to fuse  affective and cognitive domains of knowledge through art. The affective domain includes  emotions, attitudes, feelings and other intuitive ways of knowing; while the cognitive domain  refers to intellectual, rational ways of thinking.  Shier contends that in every one's daily  interactions there are always both affective and cognitive variables at work, and thus effective  classroom instruction should automatically address both. Christison (1993) believes that student- created images enhance language learning in three different ways.  First, students are more  involved, confident, and productive.  Next, there is a positive change in the classroom  environment that is uninhibited and conducive to language learning.  Finally, students are more   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   able to perform cognitively demanding tasks, and the quality of their written and spoken  language improves.  Motivation also increases when they share artwork with classmates (Wright,  1989). Shier maintains that art more actively engages students in their own learning processes on  a personal, intellectual, and physical level.  Bassano and Christison attribute this engagement to  an emotional quality in art.  Recognizing the ability of the arts and art activities to engage, and  motivate students, Allen (1990) believes the process of acquiring language comes naturally when  students are involved in activities in which they find meaning and purpose.    In addition to fostering acquisition of the English language, our Title III program will reinforce  the following skills: following directions, sequencing, retelling of a story, and speaking and  communication.   Through their work in after school, students will learn to do computer research, read and  follow directions and create art based on their home countries' artistic history.  Through this  work, students will learn the skill of sequencing events, improved speaking and communication  skills and the use of descriptions to tell about their work. Parent involvement will include passing  along information about family, cultural celebrations and the native art of  student's home countries.  Some activities for students in the after school program will include:  using the computer to research celebrations and the art associated with their cultural  celebrations.  Further benefits of our ENL program are: enhancement of creativity;  encouraging student independence; building ELLs' decision making skills;  celebrating each individuals' uniqueness; creating, exploring and experimenting with materials to  make art associated with their home countries, and sharing these  traditional celebrations with family and friends. The program will be conducted in English, as  provided by one certified ENL teacher.  One bilingual paraprofessional will be an integral part of  our Mickey Mantle Title III After School program.  The twenty-one (21) week, three (3) hour  sessions will take place every Wednesday afternoon from 3:05 PM to 6:05 PM from December  12, 2018 through June 5, 2019.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Three of the assessment tools that P811M - The Mickey Mantle School - uses to assess Alternate Assessment students are the  Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills-Revised (ABLLS-R), NYSAA and SANDI. These assessments are used for our  6:1:1 English Language Learners to determine what levels the students are functioning on in various areas, such as  communication skills, self-help skills and cognitive abilities.  The Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System and Go  Math Benchmark Assessment are mainly used with our Standardized Assessment English Language Learners. The insights that  our data provide for our English Language Learners are that we are able to determine our students’ reading levels and  potential Individual Education Program (IEP) goals and objectives. Also, through the analysis of the data, the teachers of ENLs  (Ms. Silva and Ms. Rubie) have insights into how to design their academic instruction and plan for the students.  An additional  assessment tool that is integrated in the literacy curriculum is Fountas and Pinnell.            2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      The instructional decisions in relation to data from the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT assessments will guide our development of  targeted ELA student instruction.  The following components comprise elements of our English Language Arts  Program:  independent reading; read aloud’s; shared reading; guided reading; shared writing; interactive writing; writer’s  workshop; independent writing; and word work.  In addition, the following teaching procedures will be implemented as a  means of supporting the four modalities:  journal writing; books in English and Spanish online and impromptu storytelling.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The ENL teachers ( Ms. Silva and Ms. Rubie) evaluate the success of P811M’s  programs for ELLs by focusing towards the  Adequate Yearly  Progress (AYP). The ENL teachers work cooperatively with the school staff to assist our ELL students to  perform their best on their standardized and alternate assessment exams by: utilizing portfolios and  different assessment  tools to evaluate the students’ progress (teacher- made checklists, informal tests and rubrics). The ENL teachers use the Whole  Child Approach by teaching our students how to be healthy and safe. They also engage their students in different social  challenging situations with peers and adults. Ms. Silva and Ms. Rubie assess these social interactions by observing how the  students are progressing in making more friends. Our school assesses and evaluates ELL new language acquisition and success  based on NYSESLAT scores. Using the five levels of Language Progressions: Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding,  Commanding, the ENL team then targets instruction for students, and facilitates supports, across the four modalities of  Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    P811M uses data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Interventions framework (for grades K-5) by utilizing it as  a method of classifying and servicing our students.  Our school uses three benchmark assessments for ELA to support us in  designing tiered interventions.  Beginning the school year, students are assessed using the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark  Assessment System.  Subtests include running records, fluency and comprehension checks as well as letter/phoneme and sight  word recognition checklists.  A guided reading assessment is also given.  Core Knowledge Assessments are also administered  throughout each literacy unit.  The Go Math benchmark assessment is administered at the beginning of the school year and  students are formally assessed at the end of each unit.  Informal assessments through checklists and teacher observation are  used throughout the instructional day.  Each assessment is based on the Engage New York Common Core Modules for  instruction.  Through data analysis in teacher teams, tiered interventions based on the RTI framework are designed to support  our ELL students.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   P811M uses data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention framework (for grades K-5) by utilizing it as  a method of classifying and servicing our students.

What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Based on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT statistical score a data pattern has proven that the speaking and listening skills are the  students’ strengths. On the other hand, additional support is needed in the reading and writing modalities. This pattern has  been displayed at every grade level.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         The ENL teachers (Ms. Silva and Ms. Rubie) evaluate the success of P811M’s programs for ELLs by focusing towards the  Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP).

Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our English as a New Language program is a research-based program comprised of two components: a content area  instructional component in English (including all core content, i.e. English language arts, math, science, or social  studies) with home language supports and appropriate scaffolds, and an English language development component  (Stand-alone and/or Integrated English as a New Language)  Our Integrated English as a New Language is a unit in of  study in which students receive core content area (i.e., English language arts, math, science or social studies) and  English language development instruction.     Our Stand-alone English as a New Language is a unit of study in which students receive instruction in order to acquire  the English language needed for success in core content courses. Students receive Stand-alone English as a New  Language in lieu of core content area instruction.  Our organizational models at The Mickey Mantle School are push-in, pull-out ENL services. The students are grouped  based on the classification of student to staff ratios of 12:1:1, 8:1:1 and 6:1:1, within three consecutive grades and IEP  recommendations. Depending on these needs the push-in model is used to assist students across curricular areas and  allow the students to remain in their classroom with their English speaking peers.  Utilizing the push-in model allows  the ENL and classroom teachers to collaborate in the facilitation of classroom instruction.  As a result, the English  Language Learners are given the opportunity to acquire the English language across all subject areas.  In doing so, the  ENL teachers (Ms. Silva and Ms. Rubie) provide both English and English Language Arts content instruction  simultaneously. The push-in model proceeds at the rate that the ENL teacher (Ms. Silva or Ms. Rubie) considers the  most beneficial to the ELL student.  In addition, the program models consist of heterogeneous and homogeneous  groupings. Our instruction values the students’ backgrounds, the need to prepare the students for a college  education. Our curriculum is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards, the New Language Arts Progressions,  and the New York State Language Standards.  Parent and community involvement are of utmost importance.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              The two certified ENL instructors (Ms. Silva and Ms. Rubie) ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes is  provided, according to the student’s proficiency level  through, our Freestanding ENL Program. The plan of the ENL teachers  (Ms. Silva and Ms. Rubie), is to make certain, that our students are being fully serviced.  According to CR-Part 154, correct  mandated minutes in academic support with instruction in English is delivered. Minutes served are based on students’  NYSESLAT scores. In collaboration with the ENL teachers (Ms. Silva and Ms. Rubie) and other pedagogues our school is meeting  the New York State – mandated ENL/ELA allotted instruction times. In accordance with CR-Part 154 mandates, our ELLs in  grades K-8, who scored at the entering and emerging proficiency levels are receiving 360 minutes of ENL services/week. In  Spring 2017, our students were administered the NYSESLAT.   According to CR-Part154 mandates, all the P811M English  Language Learners who reach their advanced level will be given 180 minutes of ENL/180 minutes of ELA/week. Students  participate in the ELA program with their classroom teachers. Since P811M has grades from K to 8th when our ELLs move to  the high school level, the ENL teachers will assure our students continue their ENL services, with the correct mandated  minutes.   Students who attain an Entering Proficiency level will receive 1 unit of Standalone ENL study (180 minutes) and 1  unit of Integrated ENL (180 minutes) with an additional unit of Standalone or Integrated ENL instruction (180).  Students who  attain an Emerging Proficiency level will receive .5 Standalone ENL unit of study (90 minutes) and 1 Integrated unit of study in  ENL/ELA (180 minutes), with an additional .5 unit of study either Standalone ENL or Integrated ENL of (90 minutes).  Students  who attain a Transitioning Proficiency level of proficiency will receive .5 unit of study in ENL/ELA (90 minutes) and .5 unit of  study in either Standalone or Integrated ENL. Students who attain an Expanding level of proficiency will receive 1 unit of study  in ENL/ELA or Content Area (180 minutes), students who attain a Commanding level of proficiency will receive .5 unit of study  per week of Integrated ENL in ELA/Content Area or other approved former ELL services for 2 additional years.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In New York City there are three ELL programs offered to parents at the time of initial ELL identification: Dual Language (DL),  Transitional bilingual Education (TBE) and Freestanding English as a new language (formerly known at ESL).  Transitional  Bilingual Education are designed so students develop conceptual skills in their home language as they learn English.  In TBE  programs, students transfer home language skills to English by spending instructional time primarily in the home language  before steadily transitioning to English.  TBE students receive 75 % of instruction in their home language and 25 % in  English.  The second instructional model offered to ELLs in New York City is Dual Language.  Dual Language programs are  designed to continue developing student’s home languge as well as English language skills throughout their schooling.  Dual  language programs serve both ELL students in need of English language development and monolingual English-proficient  students who are interested in learning a second language.  Both groups provide good linguistic role models for each other  and, through their interactions, support language development in both languages.  In a Dual Language program, students  receive half of their instruction in English and half of their instruction in the other/target language.     The third model offered ELLs in New York City is the English as a New Language (formerly English as a Second Language).  Students in freestanding ENL programs can come from many different language backgrounds, and English may be the only  common language among the students.  Stand-alone ENL instruction develops English language skills so that students can  succeed in core content courses and is delivered by a certified ENL teacher.      Integrated ENL is instruction to build English language skills so that students can succeed in core content courses.  It is  delivered by a dually certified teacher (ENL and a content area) or co-teaching by a certified ENL teacher and a certified  content area teacher (English language arts, math, science, or social studies).            The ENL Freestanding Program Model is delivered in the English language. Therefore, the content areas are modified  according to the students’ proficiency level. Based on the students’ different learning styles and individual student needs, the  ENL teachers (Ms. Silva and Ms. Rubie) engage each student in their learning process. The instructional approaches and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      methods used to make content areas comprehensible to enrich language development are:  Balanced Literacy  Total Physical Response (TPR)  Cooperative Learning  Whole Language Instruction  Community Language Learning  Natural Approach for Second Language Acquisition  Differentiated Instruction          In addition to the above instructional approaches , the ENL teachers also utilize ; Scaffolding, Modeling, Bridging ,  Contextualization, Schema Building, Facilitation of Language Functions, and Text Representation. The use of Bloom’s  Taxonomy instruction eases the development of the students’ meta-cognition.  We meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards by incorporating literature, informational text, and foundation skills in our ELA program. In the P811M ENL  program, the teachers include the Math Common Core Learning Standards which include geometry, counting, measurement  and data, to name a few concept skills.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      All new admits to the Department of Education or students who have been away from New York State Education for over  two years who have a home language of Spanish and are determined by the LPT to be eligible for testing will be administered  the NYSITELL.  Based on the results of the NYSITELL, the student may be evaluated with the Spanish Lab.  Within our school,  bilingual guidance counselors, Orlando Zalazar and Nayleen Droz administer the Spanish LAB.  When necessary, alternate  placement paraprofessionals work with pedagogues to formally and informally assess students’ progress.  Formal assessments  include SANDI, NYSAA, webABLLS, Iready, Fountas and Pinnell.  Informal assessments include teacher observations, sample  student work in student portfolios, and probe data.  With the assistance of alternate placement paraprofesionals students are  evaluated in using their home language throughout the school year.  In order to ensure that our new English Language  Learners are appropriately evaluated in the Spanish language the ENL teacher along with a Spanish Language Certified  Pedagogue administers the Spanish Lab.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    P811M has an instructional plan for Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) if they become part of our organization.  The ENL teachers would provide support in the form of literacy, mathematics, technology, and Academic  Intervention  Programs.  The two certified ENL teachers (Ms. Silva and Ms. Rubie) would  service the students with the necessary amount of  time according to their mandates , following the push-in model using differentiated instruction/materials during their ELA  classes.      A. SIFE:  Once a SIFE student is performing at or above the transitioning/intermediate level on the annual English language  proficiency assessment, the student's status as a Student with Inconsistent/Interrupted Formal Education is removed, even  though the student may continue to be identified as an English language learner.  B. Newcomer: The Entering level students receive 1 unit of Stand Alone study in ENL of 180 minutes and .5 unit of study in ENL  of 90 minutes.   C. Developing:  Emerging level students receive 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA of 180 minutes of ENL instruction and 1 unit of study  in ENL/ELA of 180 minutes, as well as 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA or other Content Area of 180 minutes per week.   D.  Long-Term ELLs:  These students who scored at an Transitioning level of profciency receive .5 unit of integrated study in  ENL/ELA of 90 minutes and .5 unit of study either stand alone or integrated ENL/Content Area of 90 minutes.  Expanding level  proficiency receive 1 unit of integrated study in ENL/ELA or other Content Area study for 180 minutes and Commanding  proficiency level students receive .5 unit of study per week of Integrated  ENL in ELA/Content Area or other former aproved   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      ELL services for 2 additional years.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our school’s instructional strategies and grade-level materials are created to meet the diverse needs of English Language  Learners-Students with Disabilities (SWDS) within the least restrictive environment. P811M provides equitable and flexible  access to concepts and ideas for students. In regards to inclusion, students with disabilities can work on individual skills and  goals within the context of the general education curriculum. Some supplementary aids and services that P811M have used  successfully include: modifications to regular class curriculum, assistance of an itinerant teacher with special education  training, special education training for the regular teacher, use of computer-assisted devices and provision of note takers.  All  instructional materials are differentiated in terms of student grade, age and the specific needs of each student.  Grade level  materials aligned with Common Core Standards are used and differentiated using PECS (Picture Exchange Communication  System) and other necessary differentiations based on each particular student's ENL needs and learning abilities.  Additionally,  IPad and educational computer programs are used as engaging learning activities with students. Materials for entering,  emerging, transitioning, expanding and commanding levels of proficiency are appropriately differentiated for each particular  student in order to provide maximum access to instruction and plan for maximum success within each proficiency level.  Once  the students achieve their IEPs gols, P811M moves these students to a least restrictive environment, such as from a 8:1:1 to  12:1:1 setting and/or it places them in another school building in an inclusive classroom.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The ENL teachers (Ms. Silva and Ms. Rubie ) use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable diverse ELL-SWDs  to achieve their IEP goals based on best practices. Examples of best practices are: cooperative grouping, collaborative learning,  adapted and modified materials, co-teaching and planning, ongoing  assessment, differentiated instruction, connecting prior  knowledge, the use of SMART boards, and incorporating the Common Core Standards, in conjunction with the English  Language Proficiency Standards. The grade level materials that the P811M ENL teachers implement in our program are  Foundations of Wilson, Expeditionary Learning, and Engage NY Modules. When modifying curriculum to support individual  learners, teachers engage students through multiple modalities. Examples include learning through song, physical movement  through Total Body Response, and the use of visual cues. Once students achieve their IEP goals in content areas as well as  socially and emotionally, P811M moves these students to a least restrictive environment, such as from an 8:1:1 to a 12:1:1  setting and/or places them in another school building in an inclusive classroom.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  While an ELL student may learn social skills rapidly, it may take up to seven or more years to develop academic skills. Applied  learning, Adapted Technology and Get Ready to Learn are used to support our ELLs. Literacy intervention programs are:  Balanced and Integrated Literacy,  Social Emotional Literacy Program, Foundations of Wilson, Expeditionary Learning and  Engage New York Modules. Math interventions are included within the RTI component of the Go Math Curriculum. Science  interventions are incorporated through increased opportunties for inquiry based learning approaches. Social Studies  interventions include learning through song and body movements by utilizing Total Physical Response. Academic Intervention  services are provided by the Special Education teachers in English. A special program entitled News-2-You is provided for  alternate assessment students as an additional AIS supplement. Coteaching between classroom teachers and ENL  teachers  and utilizing the push in model increases for Entering and Emerging subgroups.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      The P811M is meeting the needs of our ELLs in both content and language development. All teachers are made aware of our  ELL population and their English proficiencies based on NYSITELL, Spanish Lab and NYSESLAT scores.  In addition, ELL goals are  included in each student's IEP goals.  Teachers work collaboratively with the ENL teachers for Integrated ENL services occurring  at school.  In addition, assessments such as the Fountas and Pinnell Benchment Assessment System, iReady, SANDI, WebAbles  and student portfolios are all used to show both ENL and content area teacher student progress and growth.  Data shows that   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      the P811M NYSESLAT results have increased.  Some students moved up an entire proficiency level.  Based on these daily  assessment results during instructional time, the ENL teachers have observed the students’ growth in their listening, speaking,  reading and writing skills.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   In the 2015-2016 school year, a new STEM lab was constructed at 149, our offsite.  This lab offers students real  world  experiences through science, technology, engineering, and math.  P811M will continue to implement the following  programs: Theater Arts  program which collaborates with outside community agencies, the Mickey Mantle Debate  Team,  School  Store, Mighty Milers, Super Soccer Stars, Student Council Year Book , PBIS, RRS and Wellness in Our  Schools.  There are incentives in place such as a school store and the video games are positive reinforcers  for the students,  who have had good attendance and behavior throughout the month. The Mighty Milers is a school wide running program,  incorporated by the physical education teacher. Each class runs twice a week  in the gymnasium.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Currently, our school does not plan to discontinue any programs/services for ELLs.           12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Our English Language Learners are supported in their academic programs by having the opportunity to participate in all school  programs. Their alternate bilingual paraprofessionals and their related support service providers make certain that they are  provided supplemental services. The Title III After School Program is accessible to all ELLs in the building.     •     P811M enjoys solid relationships with the community. Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer, NYC Councilmember  Helen Rosenthal and NYS Assembly member, Lynda Rosenthal are all supporters and contributors to the school.  •     NYC Collaborates is a new partnership we have this year. The Principal and SEL committee presented to a wide cross- section (both DOE and Charter schools) of educators who attended from across the city.  •     Along with 8 other schools across the city P811M was chosen to receive a Reading Discovery award offered by the Brooke  Astor Fund for NYC receiving classroom libraries for classes K-3 provided home libraries to students in those classes.  •     P811M in conjunction with PS 149M applied for and The New York City Community Learning Schools Initiative 501(c)(3)  grant.  •     Additional community partnerships have been established to offer opportunities for enrichment and community-based  instruction through ongoing field trips and on-site activities, in which all classes participate: Daniel’s Music Foundation, Lincoln  Center, New Victory Theatre, El Museo del Barrio, The Guggenheim Museum, Good Dog and ASPCA Animal Assisted Therapy  Program, the United States Coast Guard, Grow to Learn Gardening grant program, and The New York Hall of Science SciPlay  program.  •     Through a partnership with the District 75 Office of Inclusion and the Superintendent of District 4, we are in the process of  implementing a new program that will lead to inclusive opportunities for select students. These students will be integrated for  portions of the day into co-taught lessons with their typically developing, grade-level peers in the collocated Mosaic  Preparatory Academy or in a nearby community school. This will serve to provide LRE environments to students, who will be  exposed to the general curriculum through higher order tasks aligned to the CCLS.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?    We do not have ENL or ELA standards, our ELL program follows the Common Core Language Standards. Using CCSL as our  guide, the ENL teachers use various types of texts and ELL instructional technology using all electronic mediums such as iPads,  Smartboards, Communication Devices, Sign Language, PECS, Computer Programs, fiction and non-fictional books and  dictionaries.             14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    P811M is a Freestanding ENL Program model, therefore, Native language support is developed through different types of  thematic units. These will be created taking into account the multicultural backgrounds of our ELL students. Students will be   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      able to learn about one another as well as share information about their own culture.  In this way, we (Ms. Silva and Ms.  Rubie) are developing the pride of their heritage. Learning about different countries, different foods and holiday celebrations  with the sense of creating one community is our goal.  Utilizing Total Physical Response is another approach.Through  modeling, body motions and visual aid, which help students to internalize the meaning of the lesson. Another reference for  native language support is the classroom library filled with books and dictionaries in the students’ native language. Finally,  alternate placement paraprofessionals in the classroom supplement extra support for native language, as needed.          15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our English Language Learners are supported in their academic programs by having the opportunity to participate in all school  programs. Their alternate bilingual paraprofessionals and their related support service providers make certain that they are  provided supplemental services. The Title III After School Program is accessible to all ELLs in the building.     •     P811M enjoys solid relationships with the community.

Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   All services, supports and resources for ELLs are devised and correspond to the Common Core Learning Standards. Students'  cognitive needs are differentiated based on the five ELL subgroups and according to age and academic grade level of students,  as shown by their NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores. Required services support and resources for ELLs correspond to the English  Language Learners’ ages and academic grade level.  The purpose of this is to tap into the students’ academic cognitive  development in an appropriate manner.         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    School staff assisting the newly enrolled ELLs are Parent Coordinator, Counselors, Pupil Accounting Secretary, ENL teacher and  Assistant Principals.  Activities involved in welcoming new ELLs and their families to our sites are new ELL family meetings with  the bilingual Parent Coordinator, introductory meetings with School Counselors, and family meetings with Content Area  Teachers and Related-Services Providers. If the new ELL is enrolled prior to the academic school year, the student will be able  to participate in Chapter 683, the District 75 summer program activities.  The P811M in alignment with the New Language Arts  Progression, and Common Core State Standards engage in programs and activities to assist newly enrolled ELL students. The  newcomers are provided with the following services by the ENL team (Ms. Silva and Ms. Rubie):  ENL integrated model, stand  alone model, and collaboration with the classroom teachers, and paraprofessionals, as well as the parents. Activities include  learning through multiple means of engagement such as song, body movements and use visual cues. We also encourage our   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         students to buddy up with newly enrolled English Language Learners as an additional support system. Parent workshops are  provided by the parent coordinator, Jamela Mack, to support new families.          18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   At this time, P811M does not offer language electives.       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Currently, our school only features the ENL program.     At P811M, there is a professional development plan for all ELL personnel, and teachers of ELLs, all subject areas, all content  areas, paraprofessionals, related service providers, parent coordinator and administration.  On Tuesday,  November 7, 2017,  the professional development will include the topic of Teacher Effectiveness in literacy, Quality IEP development using the  PLOPs rubric and Alternate Assessment curriculum. On Thursday June 7, 2018, the professional development will cover the  Framework For Great Schools.  These topics are of enormous benefit for everyone who works with English Language Learners.  There are various opportunities throughout the school year for staff to participate in city wide and district wide professional  developments.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The District 75 English Language Learner Office hosts professional development courses for all ELL teachers. After the ENL  teachers (Ms. Silva and Ms. Rubie) attend their professional developments, the information acquired by them  is distributed to  all staff of ELLs. The purpose is for personnel (teachers, paraprofessionals, related service providers, secretaries, parent  coordinator and administrators) who are involved with ELLs to be aware of teaching best practices, Common Core Learning  Standards, methodologies, approaches and strategies that will help our ELL students be successful.      P811M serves students from kindergarten to eighth grade. Many students from elementary school will continue middle school  in the same building. The ENL teachers (Ms. Silva and Ms. Rubie) will collaborate with the middle school instructors. This will  facilitate the students’ transition to middle school. The ENL teachers will thoroughly discuss the strengths and weaknesses of  the ENL students, their learning styles, and their NYSESLAT proficiency levels. Furthermore, when the ENL student is  transitioning from middle school to high school, the ENL teachers (Ms. Silva and Ms. Rubie) will be part of the team to decide  the best placement for the student.  The guidance counselor, Brian Joyce does parental outreach (phone calls, in person  meetings) for all students transition from middle school to high school.  He arranges for high school visits with parents and  prospective schools.  He is trained to work within the STEMS system to assure ENLs transitioning submit their choice for high  school.  Collaboration between the students’ teachers, parent(s), the guidance counselor, and the student is ongoing  throughout this important transitioning phase.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The District 75 English Language Learners Office offers the Jose P. Training.  Classroom teachers, with the exception of the ENL  teachers, are required to take the Jose P. Training which is a ten hour course for special education pedagogues. These  workshops are held on the two Superintendent Conference days In November and June.  Some classroom teachers at the  Mickey Mantle School have completed ten hours of these workshops. As a result,  they have knowledge of ENL  methodologies.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.       The parental involvement at The Mickey Mantle School is enhanced and encouraged through the parent coordinator who is  a liaison between the parents and school.  The parent coordinator makes certain that there is communication with the families  and guardians of English Language Learners by providing translated school documents and any other information that needs to  be sent home.  In addition, interpretation services will be provided, as it is needed in the fifteen foreign languages that the  Department of Education offers.  Translators will be available to come to the school or be accessible by phone with any of the  translation or interpretation needs of the ELL parents. Parent outreach includes opportunities for orientation meetings and  other meetings throughout the school year. Parents of ELLs are always invited and encouraged to participate in parent-  teacher conferences, IEP meetings, and the After School Title lll Program.  At these gatherings, parents are always asked by the  ENL teachers (Ms. Silva and Ms. Rubie) if they have any questions or concerns about their child’s progress in the ENL program.                   Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Barry Daub, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P811M Mickey Mantle School                                                                              School DBN: 75M811  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The data used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written and oral communication  is Part 3 on the HLIS which includes the language in which the parent wants to receive written information, along  with oral communication from the school. The HLIS is kept in the student’s cumulative file and faxed into SESIS.  Educators can also access this data through the student’s profile in SESIS. Under the section “Family Information”  the parent/guardian is asked to fill out their “preferred language of communication” for both written  communication and oral communication. The emergency contact cards are completed every new academic school  year. The ATS report, RPOB is another tool used to determine and assess the home language needs of the school  community.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.
