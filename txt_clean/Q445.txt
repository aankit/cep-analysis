The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.

Special student population consists of 16.12% English Language Learners, primarily Hispanic with 50.17% of the  school's student population and 13.89% Students with disabilities.   Specific needs include an integrated co-teaching model for English Language Learners where ELA and ENL teachers co- teach classes in order to support the language needs of the ELL students. Throughout the year there is a strong  instructional focus on incorporating various language scaffolds, multiple entry points and differentiation of instruction  in order to ensure the success of all ELL students. Inquiry work within content areas and Small Learning Communities  is focused on incorporation of research based pedagogical strategies which support language acquisition and  advancement in writing skills.    Some areas of focus as aligned with the 2016-2017 Quality Review feedback include the need for pedagogical  practices to support the instructional needs of ELLs and SWDs so that teachers can provide access to appropriately  challenging tasks. As a result, student engagement and participation will become more fluent and students will be  able to demonstrate higher order thinking in both work product and discussion. Students will receive appropriate  feedback based upon common rubrics and teachers constantly making effective adjustments to meet student learning  needs throughout the lessons.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our focus for this school year aligns to Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative Teachers and Strong Family and Community  Ties. Our school's professional learning and instructional plan will be anchored by the following instructional focus:   "If we as a school community constantly provide opportunities for students to engage in rigorous discussion across  content areas based on higher order thinking questions with appropriate support and timely and actionable feedback       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12      based on common rubrics, then the students will be able to make their thinking visible and independently produce  writing which demonstrates college and career readiness.

Academic tasks emphasize rigorous and higher-order skills across grades and subject areas."  Furthermore, as per the 2016-2017 School Quality Snap Shot 79% of students say that teachers keep them on track for  college and career.      Priority needs that will be addressed in response to the 2016-2017 Quality Review include:    Increasing access to appropriately challenging tasks for students with disabilities and English Language Learners so that  student engagement and participation are even and students are able to demonstrate higher-order thinking in both  work product and discourse.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           16         For Tenant 3 SOP 3.3 -    To ensure alignment to the CCLS, teacher teams work closely on a regular basis with the EQuip Tri-State Rubric to assess  alignment, rigor, and evidence of the instructional shifts to their unit plans. Along with feedback provided by the  Instructional Assistant Principal as stated in the 2016-2017 Quality Review, "Unit plans reveal Common Core-aligned  lessons and incorporate the instructional shifts that require students to read multiple texts and use close reading  strategies to analyze text structure, learn academic vocabulary, and understand information pieces to write opinion or  argument essays."       In response to the overall MOTP data for 2017-2018 in domain 1e, where 44% of teachers were less than effective  indicating the lack of use of data to inform planning and instruction; the school plans to implement the use of IO  Assessment and Performance series in addition to formative assessments that will drive student grouping and the  design of specific text, tasks and materials for individual lesson plans to build in both scaffolds and extensions.       For Tenant 3 SOP 3.4 -    According to 2017-2018 School Quality Snap Shot, only 39% of teachers say that they have opportunities to work  productively with colleagues in their school . In order to address this deficiency, Small Learning Community teacher  directors in conjunction with the programming office will ensure that teachers' programs include a common meeting  time so that teachers and meet within interdisciplinary teams to discuss the support of shared students. Furthermore,  this year, the school will implement an interdisciplinary research paper across the core subjects integrating the arts and  technology along with other STEAM concepts.       For Tenant 3 SOP 3.5 -    Throughout the school year, teachers use data from Performance Series, Data Driven Classroom and results from  Common Assessment to engage in collaborative inquiry work and monitor student progress . All teachers are engaged in  structured inquiry-based professional collaborations and distributed leadership structures ensure that teachers have a  voice in school-wide decisions and teacher collaborations are strengthening teachers’ instructional practices and  structures, such as grade and cohort teams, enable teachers to have a voice in decisions that affect student learning."      Priority needs that will be addressed in response to the 2017-2018 New York State Report Card includes:    20% of students graduate with an advanced regents designation on their diploma. In order to address this need, our  school will begin to implement quarterly assessments aligned to the New York State Regents and provide targeted  student groups who are not meeting the standards with specific Academic Intervention Services. Additionally, we have  designed a path for acceleration for all student which begins with a summer bridge program for advancement in ELA,  Math and Science. Students who complete the summer bridge courses take the respective Regent exams in August and  move into course work that includes Advanced Placement classes.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           17                 Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction.

For Tenant 5 SOP 5.2 -       According to the 2015-2016 School Quality Guide, our overall score for "Supportive Environment" was rated proficient,  indicating that students feel safe and supported at our school. It is the Principal's vision that "we work collaboratively in  a warm, safe teaching and learning environment to provide personalized, targeted support for ALL students to reach  their highest potential. Each student will graduate with the academic and life skills necessary for college and career  readiness for the 21st Century, be model citizens and contribute to their community and the world at large." In order to  accomplish this vision, the school leader has structured the school into 6 Small Learning Communities, who meet  regularly to analyze up to date student data, engage with students and families and work closely with Guidance  Counselors to design interventions and plans for success for specific students.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           22         For Tenant 5 SOP 5.4 -       In order to build a common understanding of the school's vision for addressing students' social and emotional well  being, we have adopted a school wide focus on growth mindset, grit and perseverance which are the focus of our  weekly "Kid Talk" SLC conversations and begin with summer reading assignments of a shared text by all students and  teachers. The idea is that as a school community, we will come to a common understanding of growth mindset, grit and  perseverance as they apply to success both in and out of school.      An area for growth, according to the 2015-2016 School Survey is that only 55% of teachers believe that the Principal  communicates a clear vision for the school, indicating that greater attention must be paid to articulating what this vision  will look like and sound like in practice. In order to accomplish this goal, we will align our professional learning plan ...         For Tenant 5 SOP 5.5-       The school has begun to utilize structures to support an increased focus on students’ social and emotional health and  academic success. These include having Guidance Counselors, assigned by SLC, regularly attend teacher team meetings  to discuss students, share information and plan interventions collaboratively with teachers. One mechanism already in  place for supporting students’ socio-emotional needs and academic success is our “Case Study” model, which includes  teacher mentors selecting and guiding a particular student in need of support so that they can get to know the student  and family better and collaborate with colleagues to support the student’s success. Guidance Counselor, Deans and  School Safety Agents are also involved in sharing information and providing professional development around  techniques and strategies for supporting our diverse student population. Deans, school safety agents, administration  and school staff work together to ensure that the school community is safe and supportive.         One area for improvement is the sharing and utilization of specific data related to social and emotional health and  academic success. Additionally, student voice is necessary to determine how well their needs are being met.

SLC teams along with their assigned guidance counselor will  continue to implement and refine the “Case Study” model for  mentoring and students and monitoring both their social and  emotional health as well as their academic progress.   All students will participate in an in-house survey so that they can  provide feedback regarding their academic experience and  classroom instruction. SLC teams and teachers will utilize this  information to inform curriculum and instruction. Assistant  Principals of Supervision will utilize this information to provide  targeted professional development support for teachers as  needed.   Professional development will continue to be provided in the  area of working with diverse student populations so that school  staff, teachers, deans, guidance counselors and school safety  staff can share best practices and work together to create school- wide plans for ensuring the social and emotional well-being and  success of all students. Some strategies for doing so include:  utilizing an agenda model for instruction, posting unit essential  questions to link daily learning to larger ideas, collecting exit slips  to assess progress, implementing a learning target and engaging  students in self or peer assessment.

For Tenant 4 SOP 4.2-    The 2016-2017 Quality Review states, "Aligned to the school-wide focus, rigorous tasks are embedded in units to ensure  higher-order thinking with attention to analysis and text-based questions." The school has teacher grade leaders who  are responsible for creating and revising curriculum such as unit plans, curriculum maps, pacing calendars and common  assessments. Grade level teams have an opportunity to meet at least twice per month to review curriculum and ensure  that student learning tasks are rigorous and students are provided with appropriately challenging tasks aligned to the  instructional shifts and the CCLS.       According to the 2015-2016 School Survey report, only 39% of teachers strongly agreed or agreed on the statement,  "Overall, my professional development experience this year have included opportunities to work productively with  colleagues in my school." In efforts to improve on this, the school has provided each of the Small Learning Communities  to be lead by a teacher director where they will work collaboratively to increase opportunities for teacher to work  collaboratively at least 2 times per week during their professional work period during the day.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           27         For Tenant 4 SOP 4.3-   As per the 2016-2017 Quality Review, "Teaching practices including questioning and scaffolds inconsistently provide  multiple entries into the curriculum leading to uneven levels of student engagement and thinking." This is a priority  need that will be addressed during the school year by focusing on professional learning cycles lead by Assistant  Principals and teacher leaders on incorporating multiple access points for SWDs and ELLs within unit plans and lesson  plans.       For Tenant 4 SOP 4.5-   Across content areas, teachers create common assessments including baseline, unit, midterm, final assessments. Data  from these assessments are then analyzed during monthly collaborative inquiry meetings. During the inquiry process  teachers use a common protocol in order to uncover gaps in student thinking aligned to the CCLS and revisions are  made to instruction, unit plans, lesson plans and assessments. Teacher use researched-based pedagogical strategies in  order to increase student performance.       An area of need for this school year is to improve on the use of formative assessments in order to inform instruction.  2016-2017 MOTP data shows that 53% of teachers are less than effective in component 3d: Using Assessment in  Instruction. Additionally, as stated in the 2016-2017 Quality Review, "Across classrooms, teachers use some rubrics that  are loosely aligned to the school’s curriculum. While teachers uniformly have one assessment practice that uses a traffic  light concept to check for understanding, it is inconsistently used as ongoing checks for understanding."           Part 2 – Annual Goal    Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

Information regarding school-wide goals, instructional focus, action planning and progress monitoring is shared with  teacher teams and administration. School goals, mission, vision and instructional focus information is public to the  school community, made available in print and through our school website. School stakeholders and prospective  students are provided with information about thematic SLCs, which they select upon registration in our school. While  the above information and regular feedback around frequent classroom visits are shared with teachers, additional,  customized professional learning is required to assure growth in individual teacher practice. This applies in particular to  the area of differentiation and engagement aligned to the needs of students upon whom the school is focused, namely  ELLs, SWDs and students in the school's lowest third.   Several areas of focus around the Measures of Teacher Practice (MOTP) are Danielson Components 3b Using  Questioning and Discussion Techniques, 3c Engaging Students in Learning and 3d Using Assessment in Instruction.  Additionally, as indicated by teachers in the school Learning Environment Survey, professional development offerings  will continue to be tailored to best meet teacher’s needs and incorporate choice and collaboration.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Based on the 2017-2018 School Survey, 88% of parents feel that the school staff regularly communicate with  parents/guardians about how parents can help students learn.      Though the school year, frequent opportunities are made for parents to become involved in the school community but,  only a small number of parents and family members are actively engaged in these efforts. The Parent Coordinator offers  training in Skedula/Pupil Path for parents and holds a variety of workshops. Additionally all teachers log grade and  anecdotal records into Skedula so that parents and students can regularly access the information and communicate  digitally with their child’s teachers. However, as parent involvement and attendance at school meetings and functions is  low, some alternate methods for increasing engagement should be pursued, including gauging parents’ preferences for  contact and involvement and increasing parental communication in school-wide instructional decisions. The  administration will closely monitor parental outreach being conducted by the teachers as they are provided with time  during their professional assignment to communicate with parents.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           36            This need is informed by the percentage of families completing the School Learning Environment Survey, which was only  12% of families in 2017-2018. Additionally, 79% of teachers say that at this school, teachers work closely with families to  meet students’ needs” Furthermore, 47% of families say that they had the opportunity to volunteer time to support the  school.         Additionally, being a community school for this school year, will allow the administration to work closely with our CBO  partner in order to make necessary outreach to all parents so that they are aware of the opportunities and parental  services that are being provided to them.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.     To ensure that the school maintains compliance with regard to Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) as a rule, assign  teachers programs aligned with the teaching certification(s) they hold. We enlisted the assistance from our College  University partners and recruitment fairs to recruit highly qualified candidates. All new teachers hired are supported  by mentors and observed a minimum of eight times per year to provide adequate support. Targeted professional  development support is offered throughout the year with sessions designed specifically for new teachers as well as  content area and grade level appropriate topics. This includes a half-day new teacher induction meeting at the  beginning of the year, bi-weekly coaching sessions with an assigned coach from the Office of Teacher Effectiveness  and engagement in the Instructional Rounds process at least twice per year. Both of these activities will be informed  by the needs and practices of the new teachers and provide them with the opportunity to collaborate with one  another and share experiences/best practices. Other optional sessions are arranged for new teachers after school  during the extended professional development time and include tutorials of how to use software and data systems  (e.g. Skedula, Castle Learning, DDC, Smart Notebook) on an as needed basis. New teachers meet frequently with their  supervising Assistant Principal and are encouraged to complete professional goals which can drive their progress and  encourage self-reflection.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and  paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   A Professional Development Committee meets regularly and will conduct a needs assessment in order to design a  school-wide plan for professional learning. Data used to inform this plan include the School Quality Report, School  Quality Review, Learning Environment Survey and in-house teacher surveys regarding professional learning. As a  result, professional learning will be strategically organized into cycles and a pacing calendar to maximize efficacy.  Activities for professional development include: choice based, thematic workshops built around a common theme to  promote student achievement (e. g. differentiation). Other structures for professional development involve teacher  selected collaborative planning time after school, biweekly SLC and Content Area meetings where teachers can share  best practices, turn-key recently attended off-site PD, engage in professional reading or research and examine student  work using targeted protocols such as EQUIP and the Consultancy Protocol. The CCSS will be used as an anchor       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           46      throughout this process so that teachers can deeply analyze the standards and make strategic decisions regarding  instruction based on students’ various levels of mastery.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information,  early intervention services, etc.).  N/A        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Grade level and content area teachers meet regularly to adjust curriculum and construct/refine common  assessments. Teacher teams will also engage in analysis of student work and use item analysis data from both state  and teacher created assessments to inform collective decision making. Teams will use specific protocols (e.g. Tuning  Protocol, ATLAS) in order to make these decisions as unit. Professional development will be provided regularly around  effective engagement of teachers in the inquiry process.Consultants from WITsi, CITE, The Leadership Program and  the Office of Teacher Effectiveness will conduct workshops around using assessment, integrating technology, setting  SMART Goals and determining effective strategies to increase student engagement and achievement, among other  topics. Training will also be provided to teachers around the use of DDC, which will be used to streamline assessment  item analysis data so that all teachers and guidance counselors have access to skills based information about shared  students.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           47         contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           48        A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG or SIF funds: These funds   must be used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant  application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           49      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy      Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. William Cullen Bryant High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title  I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.       William Cullen Bryant High School's Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the  needs of all parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with  disabilities. The school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent  involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation  through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of  parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.

A total of approximately 500 ELLs and former ELLs will  have the opportunity to attend up to 26 Saturdays totaling 78 hours of additional supplemental  instructional support plus daily before school and after school sessions for up to 26 weeks  beginning in October and ending in June 2019. Our instructional program will support all ELLs  and former ELLs grades 9-12  through tutoring sessions held before school (7:00-7:45), after  school (2:50-4:30), on Saturdays and Sundays (8:30-11:30) as well as during Midwinter Recess  and Spring Break (9:00-12:00). Students will attend 2 sessions during this time, one for ENL and  one in the content of greatest need for each student (Math, Science or Social Studies) with an  ENL teacher present. These sessions will target students' English language development in the  content areas to support credit accumulation and Regents scores. During all of these sessions,  students will attend one or two courses focusing on literacy skills, beginning and advanced  reading, as well as writing and speaking to complement the say program course work and "push- in" classes culminating in the English Common Core Regents Examination, content area Regents  exams and the NYSESLAT exam. During the course sessions, students will engage in  supplementary instruction in ENL to support language development in the four modalities  (reading, writing, listening and speaking) and also receive support in building academic  vocabulary and verbal fluency. Cultural trips will be planned for students to visit sites and  museums around the city such as the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and/or Broadway shows.    All teachers are state certified holding bilingual content area certifications in Science and Social  Studies: namely Living Environment, Global and American History. All ENL teachers are  certified. Teachers will use a variety of texts and supplementary resources in combination with  Q-TEL, scaffolding, and differentiation strategies; e.g. Holt Science Reading in Life Science,  Science Skills Reading in the Content Areas; ENL; All American Stories, Reading to Write,  Keystone, Social Studies DBQs and past Regent Exams. Newly arrived students, SIFE students,  students taking Regents exams, ELL-SWD and those having failed classes and Regent exams,  will be supported with increased one-on-one supplementary instruction. An item analysis  determining strengths and weaknesses of previous exams and coursework will serve as the basis  for the skill work implementation. Students will be able to make up Labs, reinforce their  challenging areas such as Global History and Math, strengthen their language skills, and develop  their conceptual thinking needed across all curricula. All supplies, such as computers, will be  required to support the activities described above. Chromebooks will be available for students to  use for programs: Rosetta Stone, Achieve3000 and translations.  The Chromebooks will be used  exclusively for Title III Instructional programs and are labeled as such.  Given the number of       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   teachers working in our Title III Program, a separate supervisor is needed solely for this  program. A total of 10 licensed ENL teachers, 4 bilingual teachers and 4 additional content area  teachers will be a part of this program.  Home language support will be addressed in professional development and planning sessions as  teachers will work with documents inclusive of the Bilingual Progressions from Engage NY and  the Special Considerations for Teachers of ELLs document from NYC DOE. In preparation for  the instructional sessions, teachers will prepare materials incorporating students' native  languages through use of our Library databases and other resources. ENL teachers will engage in  team-teaching with content area teachers and all teachers will utilize flexible grouping (e.g. by  NYSESLAT/NYSITELL proficiency level, home language, etc.) in their instruction. Students’  progress reports and report cards will also be used to identify students’ strengths and weaknesses  as they become available throughout the academic year.  Parents will be notified via phone call in their preferred/native language and via a letter sent  home with students in their preferred/native language. Records will be maintained via sign in  sheets completed by students that will be kept on file in the school.  Trips to a Broadway show will provided students practice with all modalities. Students will take  part in discussions (speaking and listening) which require them to express their opinions/make  comments, in addition to supporting them with relevant evidence from the performance.  They  will read different articles about the performance, preparing them for the show they will see, as  well as reviews lending to further discussions in which they agree or disagree with the  critic(s).  Students will also practice their writing skills when they create a review of their own  using discussions in class, the articles and reviews as a resource.  A trip to Ellis Island will  provide students with a first had look at immigration, then and now. They will compare and  contrast the immigration process as well as the reasons people emigrated to the US.  They will  also be able to share their own personal experiences.  Once again, all four modalities will be used  throughout the unit to practice and develop these skills.  These activities will allow our ENL  students to assimilate to a new culture, provide them with opportunities to explore the arts,  expose them to cultural institutions and help them to make connections between school and the  world at large.

All 18 licensed  teachers previously mentioned will participate in professional learning sessions on a monthly  basis, beginning from September 2018 to June 2019. Professional Learning sessions will take  place during school in Small Learning Community meetings, during teachers' professional  periods and on Chancellor's Conference days as well as after school and off site. Teachers will be  trained in ENL specific methodologies such as Quality Teaching for English Learners (QTEL),  Collaborative Strategic Reading (CSR). Professional Learning sessions will be facilitated by  consultants as well as experts among the school's faculty. During these sessions, teachers will  engage with professional texts outlining research based practices and delve into both quantitative       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63         Part C: Professional Development   and qualitative data about who their students are and what they need (i.e. LENS, NYSESLAT,  Scantron Performance Series, Achieve 3000 and scholarship data, student work, surveys and  other pertinent sources). The PDs will be as follows: Close Reading Series: Preparing ELLs for  English Regents (6 sessions at 1 hour each in December, February and March), Building Strong  Vocabulary (2 sessions at 1 hour each in November and January) and Methodologies for Content  Area Classrooms (3 sessions at 1 hour each in December, March and April).  Teachers of ELLs  will build upon these best practices as they meet regularly to examine student work, review  assessment data and make informed refinements to curricula and instructional practice as a  result. The data and information received will drive instruction, meeting the needs of the  students.  Records of attendance at these professional learning sessions inclusive of sign in sheets  and agendas will be maintained on file within the school.   Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as  parent orientation during ELL identification process.     rationale       schedule and duration      name of provider    how parents will be notified of these activities   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             Several events will be held throughout the year with the purpose of sharing information with  students and families and building relationships to make each child’s transition to living in the  United States and becoming proficient in English a successful one. An ELL Family Information  Night will be held in October to communicate about students’ language development inclusive of  their strengths and areas for growth. At this time, we will also discuss with parents their child’s  NYSESLAT scores with specific information regarding each modality (i.e. Speaking, Listening,  Reading, and Writing), programming and graduation requirements.  Parents will be provided  with a “Language Report” which all of their ENL, Bilingual and NLA teachers will have  prepared.  An explanation of this report will also be provided in the family’s native language. A  Newcomers Small Learning community (SLC) Spring Festival will be held shortly afterward to  give students a chance to meet and get to know all of the students and adults within their SLC.  This will be an opportunity for students to be exposed to the various traditions associated with  the fall in the US.  It will also allow students to spend time with teachers, administration and  fellow classmates in a warm and inviting environment.     Parents of ELLs will be given an opportunity to take classes and learn English on Mondays,  Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays through HANAC at no cost to the school.  Parent can  also take computer classes on Mondays from 7:30-8:30 through Global Kids.  Bilingual  counselors will provide outreach to parents and workshops addressing the following topics: the  American high school/NYS Diploma Requirements, high school study tips and guides, the  American College system and the SAT/ACT/TOEFL.  They will also inform parents of  the importance of the NYSESLAT exam and the impact it has on students’ programming.  Para- professionals and other staff members who speak Arabic, Bengali, Spanish, Hindi and other  languages representative of our school community, students and families will be invited to attend  these workshops to welcome parents and assist in translation. Materials for these meetings and  events inclusive of supplies will be funded through Title III. Monthly PA meetings will take       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    place in the school’s library on the 2nd Tuesday of each month at 6:00pm.  These meetings will  assist parents in finding needed resources available to them in the community and help them  build a strong school community as well.  Outreach and information to parents will continue to  be shared via our phone messaging system in the native language, “backpack” letters in the  official class, postings on the school’s website, through an electronic Parent Coordinator’s  Newsletter, and flyers. Announcements are made daily, with information to be shared at home of  the upcoming festivities.  Parents will be invited to chaperone trips and will be honored at our  next Newcomers SLC celebration in the Spring. Records of attendance at these  parental engagement events inclusive of sign in sheets and agendas/materials will be maintained  on file within the school.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The Achieve3000 program indicates ELLs' reading levels range from beginner (grades 1-2 ) levels through grade 6 at the  start  of the school year.   (These students are not on high school reading level.)  Teachers compare the previous year's lexile levels,  monitor student work weekly and receive monthly reports.  Students' reading levels increase annually by one to two or more  years by June after using the program. For example, in the 2016-2017 school year, students in an intermediate ENL class began  with an average lexile score of 399.  At the end of the program, the average lexile score increase and was at 415.  Overall the  lexile score increased by 116. This is characteristic of all levels and the program continues to help build students' reading and  writing skills.           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The program is evaluated by the number of ELLs who pass the NYSESLAT. The number of ELLs passing the NYSESLAT has  continuously increased.  In the administration of the NYSESLAT in the spring of 2015, 107 students showed proficiency. The  total number of ELLs (who have not shown proficiency) has decreased steadily in the last ten years. It decreased from 500  (2012-2013) to 336 (present).         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   NYSITELL test results indicate that more ninth graders score EN (beginners), EM (low intermediate) and TR (Intermediate) than  students in other grades.  More tenth graders score EX (advanced) and CM (commanding).  The numbers of eleventh and  twelfth graders  that score TR, EX and CM are spread evenly.  The 2015 NYSESLAT resulted in 107 students passing with those  remaining in the program showing more proficiency in listening/speaking skills than reading/writing.  Historically, the majority  of the students are in grades nine and ten with eleventh and twelfth graders fewer in number, but greater in proficiency.  The  master schedule reflects ELL students' needs as per their proficiency levels with NLA, bilingual, stand-alone and Integrated  content area courses offered. Students' results (and parent choice) indicate need for more free standing ESL/ENL content area  classes and fewer bilingual classes in the upper grades.  All ESL/ENL and Content Area teachers receive class lists with students'  LAT scores which indicate students' specific strengths and weaknesses and plan accordingly to develop all modalities while  stressing the reading /writing process as needed by all Regents exams. Teachers of Integrated Content Area classes work  together with the ESL/ENL teachers to develop academic language within their disciplines        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   According to parent choice, student enrollment, scholarship and test results, ESL/ENL stand-alone, Integrated , NLA  and bilingual content area classes are created in the master schedule and offered to ELLs (plus PE and electives).  All       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69         courses are departmentalized and all students are programmed to meet state graduation courses and testing  requirements individually.               Entering ELLs are programmed with one standalone class, one Integrated ELA class, and either another  standalone class or an Integrated class in either math or history.          Emerging Ells are programmed with one standalone class, and one Integrated ELA class.          Transitional and Expanding ELLs are given one Integrated ELA class.          Commanding (former ELLs) are given one Integrated ELA class.             All of the above students are programmed in classes which contain two contiguous grades in their standalone and  Integrated classes. They are programmed homogeneously so that the proficiency level is the same in one class. If  there is a programming issue, the students are programmed so that the students are within a span of two proficiency  levels (ex: EN and EM or TR and EX).    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.             There are transitional bilingual Spanish content area courses in Social Studies, and Science along with Native  Language Arts. Students are programmed according to NYS requirements and their interests. These students are  grouped so that ninth and tenth graders are in one class (L –lower termers) and eleventh and twelfth graders are in  another class (U- upper termers).  There may be a class for which both tenth and eleventh graders may be  programmed, such as geometry.  In that case, the code for that class would be I – intermediate.      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A     2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Bryant complies with mandated units of study.  All class periods are 42 minutes long daily.  Entering ELLs receive two  periods daily of standalone and one Integrated ELA (126 minutes daily), Emerging ELLs diates receive one period of standalone  and one period of Integrated ELA daily (84 minutes daily), Transitional  and Expanding ELLs receive one period of Integrated  ENL  (42 minutes daily). All students receive every subject every day.  Students in bilingual programs receive HLA 42 minutes  daily.  All subject departments and chairpersons, guidance counselors and Program Office staff are apprised of mandates for  ELLs.  All departments follow NYS curricula.  All teachers have access to Skedula, NYSESLAT scores and students' standardized  test scores        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      All teachers are certified in their areas: ESL, NLA, Content Areas.  Bilingual science, and social studies teachers delilver  instruction in Spanish and English according to students' needs / levels.  There are texts in both languages.  Teachers of ELLs in  standalone ESL/ENL classes are certified in ESL.  Integrated ELA classes have either teachers that are dually certified in ELA and  ESL or have certified ESL teachers push in and coteaching.  Integrated math and history classes have certified ESL teachers  pushing in and coteaching. All classes with ELLs incorporate translation dictionaries, cross (ESL) level pairing, language pairing,  vocabulary strategies, academic language practices (Disciplinary Literacy, Cloze Reading, Meaningful Vocabulary, Scaffolding)  and a variety of texts. Rigorous tasks which include high order thinking are aligned to the Common Core grade level of the  students.                4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70         Teachers of NLA and bilingual classes are fluent in the native language and assess students accordingly.  Students may also  receive Regents exams in their native language where available.  Students use translation dictionaries or glossaries.    In  addition, students are given the ELE Exam and newly admitted students receive the Spanish LAB.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    There are various ESL and content area courses for different subgroups. Bryant offers five levels of ESL/ENL  courses to meet  students' needs.  All beginning and lower intermediate level ESL/ENL courses benefit from the Achieve3000 differentiated  reading program.  a. SIFE students receive a period of a standalone literacy or beginner course that offers extensive skill development depending  upon students' levels and needs. These students are also able to use Rosetta Stone in order to help them in their development  and acquisition of English.  b. Newcomers are programmed as per their assessed ability, grade and transcript evaluation.  There are beginner (literacy),  high beginner, low and high intermediate (transitional) and advanced courses.  In addition there is a special course for  newcomer students according to their grade level in either the Achieve 3000 program or an elective class such as Public  Speaking.     c. ELLs 4-6 years are offered intense reading and writing in the high and low intermediate courses.  Students also benefit from  the Achieve3000 program .  d. Long Term ELLs are programmed for special (ISS) and Achieve 3000 classes that target reading comprehension and scaffold  the writing process and include a variety of text complexities. There is a variety of courses on each level (EN, EM, TR,EX) that  offer students help in the different modalities depending upon their needs, years here and levels as per years of service,  NYSESLAT and regents results / requirements.  All students are targeted for the Saturday Academy.  Attendance is  monitored.     e.  Lists of Former ELLs are created and disseminated to all departments, guidance and testing coordinator.  Students are  afforded all testing accommodations of extended time, use of translation dictionaries and third reading of ELA Regents Part  I.  F-ELLs attend Saturday Academy and weekday tutoring and receive transitional support class (42 minutes daily) in an  Integrated ELA class. There is daily afterschool tutoring in multiple levels of ESL.                 6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?            Teachers of ELLs - SWD group them homogenously and by language, incorporate realia, technology, e.g. SMART board,  power point visuals, Internet research, scaffold tasks according to individual students, conference one to one, and create a  variety of teacher adapted resource materials in addition to required HS course texts.               7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?          Extra and Co-curricular events are scheduled after school and are advertised throughout the school community to enable  all students to attend.  The sports, clubs, theatre, music, dance, art and student government activities are open to all students  who wish to try out / attend them.   Courses are scheduled throughout the day to meet all students' insructional  needs.  Library is open to all students all day.           8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71      There are bilingual and Integrated ENL content area classes.  All ELLs are assessed in math upon entry to Bryant and may be  programmed for double period courses as needed (Spanish and Integrated ENL).  There is math tutoring throughout the day  and history, ESL and science tutoring after school in addition to an extensive Title III Saturday Academy in the five major  subjects.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Teachers are re-examining curriculum to incorporate more non-fiction texts and essential questions. The Newcomers Academy  allows for the collaboration between ESL/ENL and content area teachers.  It gives teachers an opportunity to discuss specific  students' needs and create plans to ensure progress and academic success       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs are part of the entire school community and have classes throughout the building. Art, music, computer and PE classes  are heterogeneous with mainstream.  Students participate in assemblies, sports, clubs, festivals, plays, music, art, honor  societies, student government and other special programs.  (See #9)  There is a Title III program.  Students may attend  Saturday Academy and weekday tutoring programs.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The ESL/ENL department has its own computer and iPad carts for Achieve3000 and class activities.

Students are also able to use Rosetta Stone to help them in their acquisition of English.  Students use a varietyof  texts.  Teachers have access to SMART boards.  Content area courses have texts and materials in Spanish.  Students have  access to translation dictionaries.   Library offers books in many languages       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?    ELLs in the bilingual program receive one (42 minutes) period daily of NLA.  There are four levels of NLA.  Students are  assessed in NLA skills and programmmed accordingly.  Bilingual content area teachers follow a progressive Native Language /  English continuum from 75%/25% to 25%/75% over the course of the year.          14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All services and resources are high school level appropriate.  Academic materials are high school level (ages 14 - 19 years) as  per NYS Regents exams and CCSS as per course and grade level.  Materials are scaffolded to meet student needs       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The ESL/ENL department has its own computer and iPad carts for Achieve3000 and class activities.  Achieve3000 is available in  Spanish to students participating in the program.

There are also events held during each semester to help students become  acquainted with their fellow classmates and be introduced to various activities in the school as well as their new  environment.  This includes a Newcomers Thanksgiving Fall Festival and a Multicultural Festival.  Those involved are the  ESL/ENL teachers as well as the Integrated ENL and Bilingual teachers in the school.  The Newcomers' guidance counselors and  the ESL Assistant Principal are also involved.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    ELLs may elect Spanish, French or Italian language courses.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school.

Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  see below     ESL teachers receive yearly training in the use of Achieve3000 reading program's newest features.   Students' reading lexiles  and progress will be shared amongst all ESL / content area teachers.  ESL /ELA Teachers are trained in the administration and  scoring of the NYSESLAT and ELA Regents exams every year.  ESL AP & ESL teachers collaborate with content area teachers of  ELLs (Integrated ENL teachers) to develop and share best practices focusing on academic language development in all subjects,  e.g. strengthening vocabulary and writing skills as required in the different subject areas.  Teachers of ELLs have received  professional development on topics such as compliance, entitlements, vocabulary / reading strategies, etc. ESL teachers align  curricula and course lessons with new CCR core standards.  ESL teachers develop lessons in alignment with new ELA Regents  exam.   ESL AP/Literacy Coach disseminates and trains other APs of Science, Social Studies, Math and Pupil Personnel services  who turnkey other staff members including other teachers, guidance counselors, paras, aides, secretaries and psychologist /  social worker.  AP ESL/Literacy Coach disseminates information regarding ELLs and conducts training during the year for  teachers of ELLs as well as guidance department, program and admissions office staff as needed.  The professional  development requirements as per CR Part 154.2 are met during select bi-weekly Small Learning Community and Content Area  meetings, during full-day Chancellor's Conferences as well as out off site Professional Development sessions. All ENL Teachers  and their co-teaching partners are provided with on-site training in co-teaching methodologies and meet regularly (at least  once per month) to jointly refine curriculum and share best practices based on their ENL student population. ENL co-teachers  are also provided daily collaborative planning time.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Namita Dwarka, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           75                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   William Cullen Bryant H.S.
