This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      P.S. 191 Mission Statement:     engaging all children in active and meaningful learning    emphasizing cooperation, discussion and self-reliance      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9   teaching by example how to respect and care for one another  involving parents in the learning process and decision-making         providing a supportive setting for academic, social and creative growth               2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    We remain a top school in New York City according to our initial 2017-18 School Quality Guide scores. According to  The Framework for Great Schools we once again scored very high in each of the 5 categories including trust. We  maintain a high level of parent and teacher satisfaction as compared with other schools in the district and throughout  the city. We scored a 4.94 in Rigorous Instruction up .60 points as compared to the district and 1.25 points above the  NYC average. Our Collaborative Teachers score was 4.78 up .41 as compared to the district and .99 above the NYC  average. In the Strong Family-Community Ties section (Outreach to Parents) we scored 4.40 .14 above the district and  .61 above the NYC average. In Effective School leadership we scored 4.62 up .65 as compared the district and 1.01  above the NYC average. Regarding trust we scored 4.38 -.50 above the district and .70 above the NYC average. Over  63% of our parent community took part in the survey as well as 96% of our staff. This indicates we are on the right  track and will continue working to improve all categories to support and improve st0udent learning. These results  continually exceed city and peer group horizons. This further proves that our school community and instruction  remains stronger than ever.   As you can see, Rigorous Instruction along with high expectations play a vital role in educating our children and these  expectations need to be communicated to parents, students and staff. We will remain focused and stay determined  that every child show progress (Rigorous Instruction), every parent be involved in their child’s education (Strong  Family Ties) and every staff member (Collaboration/Trust) be part of the process. It is also part of leadership (Effective  School Leadership)to streamline and integrate these high expectations into ongoing work at the school. Our coherent  instructional focus aligned to the Common Core (decided upon collaboratively by the needs of our students, staff and  parent community) help to maintain and highlight our high expectations. Student engagement and discussions, higher  order questioning, multiple entry points, designing and implementing a more coherent instruction are all being  promoted in classrooms through the use of Danielson’s Framework for Teaching. Our focus will be on reading and  writing implementing the "Teacher’s College Program", infusing the STEM curriculum along with technology and  incorporating math discourse into our daily mathematical instruction . Differentiated strategies like using Depth of  Knowledge Charts, Thinking Maps, Smartboards, complex texts, peer and self -assessment, student led discussions,  and hands on mathematics learning will continue to provide and support rigorous instruction throughout the year   The staff at P.S. 191 is a community of learners that always puts children first. We are proud to say that 100% of  teachers feel supported by our school in categories like safety, classroom behavior, Social Emotional support, peer  support for academic work and academic expectations. In 2012 we received the National Blue Ribbon Award from the  United States Department of Education. For the 2014-2015 school year we received a score of Well Developed on our  Quality Review with a high score of 4.99 out of 5 as to how well the teachers work together. This year 99% of our staff  felt supported by their peers, willing to take responsibility for improving our school and are actively trying to improve  their teaching. One of our goals is to continue sharing best practices by visiting colleague’s classrooms (collaborative  rounds) and discussing instruction on how to best meet student needs. Our building is composed of grade teams, a  vertical team and a staff development committee who go above and beyond their job descriptions to do what’s best  for children and each other. The UFT contract provides for additional professional learning time on Monday and  Tuesday afternoons and we provide additional common preps, professional activities and volunteer after-school  workshops. Two additional parent-teacher conferences are part of the school calendar during the school year for a  total of four.   In previous years we were the recipient of the “Respect for All" award. Our students are active members in our  community. The Student council plans and organizes charitable activities (Penny Harvest, UNICEF, Toys for Tots, City  Harvest, St. Jude’s Math-a-thon and Make-a-Wish Foundation). This year through a district initiative our 2 class  presidents(feature leaders) joined a district leadership group of youngsters to help raise money for The Ronald   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      MacDonald's house. We emphasize the importance of Respect for All and promote Diversity in Education throughout  the year. This year we have expanded our Supportive Environment curriculum by adding more social-emotional  learning through the Sanford-Harmony program for our student’s as well as infusing Emotional Intelligence training  for the administrators and staff. Our days are filled with experiences that unite the students and staff. The student  government also plans many exciting “Spirit Days” throughout the year. Students are given certificates, buttons and  honored at PTA functions on a monthly basis to represent various attributes such as positive attitude, outstanding  role model, caring/ kind and good citizen. In December we select 4th and 5th graders to work with the Assistant  Principal to become Peer Mediators. In addition, we choose books of the month to highlight good behavior, promote  respect and enhance our school environment.   For the past several years, we have invited children’s authors, math magicians and science experts to share their  insights into learning and their love of literacy with students, family and faculty. We work with the Fort Totten Park  Rangers, our Local Library, Museum of the City of NY, LEAP Arts Programs, Citi Center, Queens College Theater Group,  Old Bethpage Restoration Society, APEC and other cultural institutions. Among others, we enjoy Twin Day, Pajama  Day, Crazy Hair Day and School Spirit Day.    One of our greatest accomplishments (Trust, Strong Family Ties) is that we work closely with our parent community  sharing with them a love of learning and teaching. Over 90% of our families say they get opportunities to visit their  child's classroom, such as observing instruction or participation in an activity with their child. Our families feel that  they are greeted warmly when they call or visit our school and 94% say their teachers work closely with them to meet  their child's needs. PS 191 has a strong involved Leadership Team consisting of teachers, administrators and parents.  School goals, policies and creating the CEP are just some of the things we work on. All members attend PTA and  community functions and are active in our school community events. During PTA meetings, Leadership Team  meetings, and PTA Executive Board meetings we share methods and strategies that are used in our classrooms to help  students and parents understand the high expectations of the common core standards.   We offer monthly parent workshops about the Common Core Learning Standards, state tests, new curriculum, and  this year we will continue to focus on our successful monthly STEM and Technology parent forums. Teachers are  required to spend 40 minutes per week on parent involvement activities. Tuesday afternoons are spent working on  parent newsletters, Class Dojo, contacting parents and working alongside our families in order for the students to  meet and maintain our high expectations. Our parents stay involved with our school providing numerous fund-raising  events and activities for our children. Students, staff and parents look forward to many annual events at P.S. 191.  Some favorites are Grandparents’ Day, 100th Day of School, International Day, Science Fair, School Spirit Day, and  Curriculum Fair, musical concerts, Family PTA Nights, Movie Nights, Mayflower Idol, and grade level celebrations.  Parents and staff not only attend these events, but are actively involved in each one of them. We even have our very  own “PS 191 Cookbook.” We have a bi-monthly newsletter in which our Principal, Assistant Principal, PTA Presidents  and Parent Coordinator submit letters to our families. Each class submits student work to include in the newsletter.   Monthly calendars of school activities, parent surveys and parent workshops are also given out during the year. We  will continue to improve our website and PS 191 school phone app for parents to have easier and instant access to  school information. The app worked well in that it was capable to send parents text messages (which are something  that they requested on our parent workshop survey) instantly and reminders to attend important school functions.  Both the website, twitter and the app will have similar information to what has been included in our Mayflower  Newsletter. We provide language translators at PTA and School Meetings/School Events and try to have some of our  newsletters translated when possible.   We are a true community of learners!         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11            3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.     1- 12:1 special education class (grades 3/4)) for the 2018-2019 school year.    1-12:1 special education (grades 1/2) for the 2018-2019 school year.     ICT - 2nd grade class. The specific needs for ICT students include rigorous instruction with active student  engagement that is aligned to CCLS using 2 certified teachers.   Our SETSS program has been successful pushing in and pulling out students in need of remedial services. Students  with IEPs and at-risk children are serviced throughout the day and during after-school programs. The SETSS program  incorporates our RTI Program which includes targeted instruction and behavioral interventions to improve student  performance and help to maintain an environment where students feel safe and supported.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   During the 2017 / 2018 school year, P.S. 191Q made progress in many areas:   Rigorous Instruction (4.94) Score on Framework for Great Schools Report/ increased from 2016-2017 (4.78)   According to our Quality review / PPO visits and our school survey our school engages in a rigorous and coherent  curricula in all subjects. It is accessible to all learners and aligned to the Common Core. We successfully introduced  the Teacher's College Writing Program and have seen tremendous growth in our students’ writing. Looking at our  June 2018 Instructional Report overall writing scores in 5th grade went up from .59 to .71, 4th grade from .67 to .72.  and 3rd grade remained the same. We will continue to implement the program with even more rigor this year.  Aligning ongoing assessments, grading practices and consistently analyzing information on student learning outcomes  will continue while strengthening our teacher team work. We adjust instructional decisions at grade, school and  classroom levels and it is informed by Danielson’s Framework for Teaching, which was implemented at effective or  highly effective levels this year. We will continue to focus on Domain 3b - Using Questioning and Discussion  Techniques in the classroom and 3c-student engagement. Teachers maintain conference notes and make immediate  adjustments based on the information gathered. Across all grade levels and subjects they engage in ongoing checks  for understanding in their grade and vertical inquiry groups. The teacher’s ask thought provoking questions of the  students which lead them into accountable, open on target conversations and feedback. The students continue to  offer suggestions while peer editing, reading and discussing each other’s work and some expert student writers even  confer with other struggling writers in their class. There is an open learning and sharing environment that we will  continue.    Collaborative Teachers (4.78) Score on Framework for Great Schools Report/increased from 2016-2017 (4.69)    Ninety Nine percent of the teachers felt that peer collaboration is highly effective here at PS 191.We are passionate  about sharing best practices with each other and this year we will continue as a learning community to promote high  levels of student thinking and learning as noted by our scores from the school report. School Commitment (our school  theme), the quality of our professional learning, innovation and collective responsibility all were voted high and play  an important part in our schools’ success. Staff inter-visitations will continue throughout the school (100% of the staff  took part this year) to discuss and share best practices. This year we will continue to engage in collaborative rounds  with a focus on math discourse. We established a culture of trust where professional collaboration during visits and  on teacher teams is beginning to pay off. This year we hope to strengthen our team work.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      We devote time on Monday afternoons for Professional Learning to share our knowledge collectively and Tuesday  afternoons for grade and vertical inquiry team meetings, staff development committee meetings, grade conferences  and individual observation conferences. We have seen a steady improvement in all components of Danielson through  our collaborative approach to teaching, both with our seasoned teachers and our newer staff members. In moving  forward we need to continue to broaden our understanding of all components of the Framework. Our staff is  committed to learning and implementing the strategies needed to become or maintain highly effective teaching  practices.   Creating Strong Family-Community Involvement: (4.40 ) Score on Framework for Great Schools Report/ increased  from (4.29)   Even though each year we score high on our parent surveys regarding parent involvement and trust, we will continue  to establish even stronger partnerships with families to support students’ learning and prepare them for college and  career readiness. We survey the parents 2 times a year to ask how we can help them become more involved in their  children’s education and to tell us ways that they can be more involved at PS 191. We would like to continue to offer  monthly workshops in Math, ELA, parenting skills, special needs/at-risk services, STEM and technology. This will allow  parents to learn alongside of their children with the support of a staff member. We will also work together on keeping  families informed of their children’s progress and offer alternative instructional practices that the parents can use to  assist their children in learning. Parents will attend additional activities or workshops provided by staff members and  our PTA, including bringing back our family math nights from previous years. Our community will continue to make  families feel welcomed as “Our Partners” in their child’s education. We will continue to focus on parent involvement  and communication using our school app, twitter, website and parent surveys.   The key areas of focus for the 2018-2019 school year are:        Strengthen our school's Literacy programs (TC Writing and Reading)  Supportive Environment (SEL): continuing with our social-emotional learning programs for students and staff  that are cohesive across all grade levels to help drive learning and support student and staff decision making.      Maintaining a Strong Family Ties: Strong parent community Involvement in all areas of learning. We will   continue to involve parents in the integration and learning of the STEM curriculum, technology, Teacher's  College Reading and Writing Program and math discourse during Tuesday afternoon parent time, classroom  events and monthly family workshops.      Collaborative teachers: The teachers and staff will work in collaborative cycles to focus on enhancing math   instruction and improving math discourse throughout the school.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 26Q191   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   396   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Our Leadership Team, Staff development Team and Review team evaluated the writing standards and found that our  transition to the Teacher's College Writing Program was successful. Our MOSL scores (using the NYC Writing  Performance as a baseline) have shown improvement for all grades . Looking over the writing tasks the average rubric  scores were over 3, with the exception of first grade which was a 2.97. Our June 2018 Instructional Report showed  overall writing scores in 5th grade went up from .59 to .71, 4th grade from .67 to .72. and 3rd grade increased with  the exception of our special needs population. We evaluated other data from our Quality Review Report, PPO, School  Quality Guide, NY State test scores and district goals to align them to our writing focus. Overall our ELA scores went  up 13.9 points from the previous year.    Administration, classroom teachers, vertical and grade level teams, and cluster/ special needs teachers all agreed that  we need to continue to focus on student writing using the Teacher's College Writing Program. We will also focus more  intently on grade 1 writing and work with our special needs population to increase their writing skills. This year we  have decided to remain a Teacher's College Writing/Reading Project School. All grades and out of classroom teachers  will work alongside our in house T.C. staff developers in implementing the units of study. Teachers as well as  administrators will attend professional learning at Teacher's College . We will also provide TC professional  development to parents including workshops and classroom celebrations of writing accomplishments throughout the  year.

Writing Program, we have decided to take on the T.C. Reading Program. The  teachers and staff felt that using a different reading program did not align to our school goals and found it difficult to  match our TC writing work to our reading response writing. Our Fountas and Pinnell reading levels were lower than  expected. We looked at reading score trends over the years and noticed that our reading scores have gone down over  the past 3 years except that last year we went up 13.9 points. Most teachers in grades 3, 4 and 5 used parts of  Teacher's College reading on their own and found that our current reading program "ReadyGEN" was not a rigorous  enough program especially in grades 4 and 5. The 4th and 5th grade teachers implemented TC Reading on their own  and the result was astounding in that 4th grade went up 8 points and 5th grade went up 25 points. The students  reading levels were also much higher. Teacher leadership team members shared their data and vision with the  parents on the team and everyone agreed that we should fully implement the T.C. Reading Program this year.   We need to prepare our students for college and career readiness. As the T.C. Writing Program led to an  improvement in the level of student work, we believe that the addition of the T.C. Reading Curriculum will also lead to  an increase in student independence, stamina, comprehension and an overall reading levels.   As an effective school leader, I looked over the data, current programs and teacher reading instruction and realized  that we needed to change programs. Our overall reading scores can be better when students spend more time  reading. Comprehension and other reading skills also need to improve and we believe that the Teacher's College  Reading Program is the best fit for our school community.

CEP Goal – 5E (Strong Family Ties) SCORE 4.40 (.up .41 from the District average and .61 above the NYC average)   98% of parents/guardians agreed or strongly agreed that they feel well-informed by the communications they receive  from their child's school.   99%of parents/guardians agreed or strongly agreed that their child's school communicates with them in a language  and in a way that they can understand.   95%of parents/guardians agreed or strongly agreed that school staff regularly communicate with them about how  they can help their child learn.   Needs Assessment:   The Leadership Team along with our Parent Coordinator surveyed parents in January and June 2018 about the success  of our family STEM nights. We received positive feedback, they were well attended we plan to continue and improve  them. In addition we provide computer access here at our lab to families that do not have technology at home and  work with them at school on supporting their technology concerns. Our parents continue to be involved and learn  alongside their children when it comes to technology, science and mathematics.    With such a high percentage of parent satisfaction and trust in the school, our “Monthly STEM Activities” will continue  to thrive and provide more opportunities for parents to become knowledgeable and be able to support their children.  We will actively invite, engage, motivate, and inspire all students in various subject areas and related to STEM career  pathways.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 191Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 191 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act.   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

The language of instruction is English. The  schedule is for 2 hours and will include grades 1 through 5. The program will be in cycles  alternating grades. We will  offer the program to entering through expanding ELLs. We will  invite each grade for 5 weeks at a time. This way we are able to target our instruction and focus  on skills for each grade. This program will bolster students' reading, writing, listening, and  speaking skills in order to better prepare them for the NYSESLAT, ELA, and to begin their path  to college and career readiness.   These Title III activities and materials will support English Language Learners and develop  their reading and writing skills during this after school program. These skills transfer over into  the content areas of math, social studies, and STEM. The supplemental instructional services are  based on student need and data gathered from the classroom teachers, the ENL  Teacher,  NYSESLAT data and the writing performance tasks.  According to the 2016-2017  NYSESLAT scores, most students in grades K-5 scores increased, but as the data shows, many  students scored the lowest on the writing portion of the exam.  Looking at their classroom  writing pieces, speaking to the teachers, and grading the writing performance tasks, we  determined that writing was in area in which all ELL students needed improvement. The new  exam is fully aligned to the Common Core Standard, which made it a bit more challenging. We  will once again work with the Teacher's College writing program.  The focus will be to improve  the overall writing of our ENL students (which includes Narrative, Argumentative and  Informational writing). The students will practice and implement the correct grammar,  conventions, vocabulary and sentence structure. Using the Teacher's College methodology they  will create essays using fact-based evidence. They will develop opinion essays and write  narrative procedures.   The teacher providing the service is a New York state certified in TESOL K-12 and in General  Education grades 1-6. There is no other program operating during the hours of the Title III  program therefore direct supervision by a licensed supervisor must be include in this  program. The principal will be there to support, supervise, and monitor the program and remain  with the students during dismissal.  The principal also takes part in student/parent activities,  writing celebrations, help plan instruction, review data and implement the program. The students  and the teacher will also work with the STEM/ Technology teacher on implementing hands on  computer based ENL programs and STEM related projects.    All materials used will be supplemental and distinct from materials used for daily instruction.  The ENL after school program has it"s own  nonfiction library of academic books in many  different areas and genres.  A picture library as well as reference materials (picture dictionaries  in English and foreign languages) aid vocabulary enrichment. IPads , books, and materials  (DVDs) with non -fiction based information will help them to create themes of study (National  Geographic videos, BrainPop ESL, BrainPop, Raz-Kids, Writing A-Z) to write about. Hands on  activities also include art and science activities using big books and graphic organizers for  writing (Thinking Maps) , teacher made materials, globes and maps which all tie into the  Common Core nonfiction areas of learning.  Students work together to use charts and word   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   banks with academic vocabulary to form sentences, paragraphs, stories and art projects. ELL  students listen, speak, read and write in every session.  We will purchase a subscription to  IXL.com for English Language Arts. IXL is a skill specific computer based program that  assesses student progress and informs the teacher of any skills that the student needs.   Attendance will be taken at each class and collected by the office. It will be reviewed by the  administrator and parents will be notified of any absences or issues regarding the program's  attendance. Parents will also be included in our Title III Program. We will provide continuous  communication through phone calls, teacher correspondence, newsletters, PS 191 app and letters  home in their preferred language (English).  Access to multimedia and technology programs will  be provided during class and shared with our parents in as many languages as possible.  Translators(parent volunteers) will also be available at parent events and throughout the program  duration. Where necessary we have staff that speak Spanish,Hindi, Punjabi or Chinese.  Our  families will join us during monthly writing celebrations other program activities and at our end  of the year celebration.               Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             The rationale for ENL professional development is to keep educators informed and involved  with ENL updates and new methodologies to enhance ENL learning and professional  expertise. The ENL teacher will conduct professional development activities for school staff  during grade conferences and faculty meetings.  There are informal congruence meetings with  classroom teachers throughout the year.  ENL monthly Liaison meetings as well as professional  learning meetings are provided throughout the year by Queens North English language learners  group that our teacher will attend and turn-key information to our staff. Updates on ENL  methodologies, policies and testing are reviewed by all staff members.  The ELL training for all  staff  is presented during staff conferences and professional days .  ELL learning techniques and  strategies are demonstrated for teachers in grades K-5.  One of the major focuses is on test taking  strategies to preparing them for the state exams.   Professional Development Time-Line: 1 hour sessions:  September 2018:  Review of ENL strategies for classroom.  November 2018: Interpreting ELL student data and how it applies in classroom  December 2018:  Techniques to help ELL students handle classroom work according to their  level of English proficiency.  February 2019:  Preparing ELL students for standardized assessments using ELL strategies.  March 2019: Preparing students for NYSESLAT.  May 2019: Academic vocabulary for ELL students.  Congruence meetings are held as needed to provide updates on children and curriculum  issues.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69         Part C: Professional Development   New teachers in the school also have the opportunity to "shadow" the ENL teacher to observe  ELL strategies in action.  This enables non-ENL teachers to see how English Language Learners  become engaged in a classroom setting as opposed to a much smaller ENL group.  Teachers will  also attend outside workshops about helping ENL learners meet standards.  Our Professional Learning Committee will work with our ENL teacher in creating an agenda  (including goals and objectives), and maintaining all attendance records. During teacher  classroom intervisitations and collaborative rounds the teachers and administration will share  feedback on ENL strategies learned and implemented that have a positive impact on student  learning.   Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as  parent orientation during ELL identification process.     rationale       schedule and duration      name of provider    how parents will be notified of these activities   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             Parents are notified with a translated letter for ELL parent workshops. The parent engagement  activities at 191 that are targeted toward parents of ELLs will help ELLs' educational  achievement.  These activities are designed to create strong family bonds with the PS 191 school  community. As the ENL teacher and other teachers model learning techniques during class  visitations, parent teacher conferences and ENL/school-wide/after school activities, parents will  learn how to help their children at home.  Parent involvement activities take place throughout the school year at PS 191 during the  program. They are invited monthly  to share in their child's learning and use the materials  provided during the after-school program  at home. The ENL teacher as well as other staff  members participate in these workshops and we will use parent volunteers to translate. Paid  translators will be used at parent teacher conferences    The following is a list of workshops and events for parents (1 hour sessions) Helen Parliaros  (ENL teacher)  September 2018:  ENL Parent Orientation  October 2018:  How to use IXL.com  November 2018: Multicultural Festival  January 2019:  Vocabulary enrichment, helping at home  March 2019: Overview of NYSESLAT Exam for parents of ELLs  In May 2019, the ENL Teacher and a local Artist will host a Parent/Child Art workshop where  they will create a painting on canvas. This hands-on activity will allow students to  strengthen their listening skills by following the directions they are given in order to create a  painting. This activity will directly engage parents in their child's learning and allow the parents  and students to learn from one another.  In addition, other parent involvement activities include:the following:   -PTA Meetings, Volunteering at PTA School Functions (book fair, school festivals, etc.)   -Parent/Child Movie:  teacher models questioning techniques/writing/art projects while viewing  a video (can be repeated at home).  -Thanksgiving/American Holiday:  ELLs create an edible food display for the dinner table.  This  promotes family bonding and knowledge of American history.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    -Open computer access for ENL families without a computer  -ENL Awards Ceremony:  Culmination activity/Celebration (parent  helpers/guests).   Refreshments and ceremony to recognize individual student  growth/achievement in the ENL after school program.  -The ENL teacher, Parent Coordinator, and multi-lingual nurse are present during these activities  to aid in translations and make parents feel at home in their neighborhood school.  Parent attendance logs will be kept and reviewed by administration. Surveys are send out  quarterly to all parents asking what they need to better support their child's learning and social  issues. Workshops will be offered throughout the year using data from the NYSESLAT, state  Math or ELA assessments. Other parental needs are addressed in other ways at PS 191.  Parents  in need of learning English are encouraged to attend free classes at a nearby District 26 school.  Parents are notified in writing about these events.  Our multi-lingual nurse as well as other  bilingual staff members are able to speak to non-English speaking parents directly to offer  information and assistance.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  PS 191 uses the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System to assess the early literacy skills.  In general most ENL  children, even those that are emergent readers, have difficulties with reading comprehension, vocabulary, and  writing.  Leveled libraries give these students a chance to read on an appropriate level of understanding.  The school's  instructional plan can accommodate children on different levels by differentiating instruction within the classroom and  departmentalizing those students far below grade level.  Concrete nonfiction reading and writing as well as vocabulary  development is emphasized in every classroom.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Every teacher uses the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System to assess individual student reading levels which  are collected 3 times a year. The students levels are recorded and given to the administration. The data is then used to form  reading partnerships in classrooms as well as guided reading groups. Teacher's College reading and writing is implemented in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74         every classroom by teacher collaboration and professional learning sessions in school focused on the Teacher's College  Program.  Teacher's meet with staff developers from Teacher's College and enVisions Math during Monday professional  learning sessions. They also discuss student data, teacher practice and students learning needs during common prep periods  during the week.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We use the NYC Performance Writing Tasks, NYSESLAT scores, Fountas and Pinnell reading and on demand writing samples  from teachers college.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered, the information is collected by the ENL teacher and is reviewed by the  administration and our AIS/ENL team. Team members meet with the  teachers during teacher team meetings and congruence  meetings on Tuesdays and throughout the month. They discuss student progress, skills needed to re-teach and share best ENl  teaching practices. The classroom teacher and the ENL teacher discuss strategies that will help individual students based on  their strengths, weaknesses and English proficiency level. The ENL also provides professional learning strategies to the entire  school staff during school meetings. These strategies are ways to differentiate learning in the classroom for English Language  Learners.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The AIS /ENL Team meet monthly to identify and discuss RTI students that are struggling using Fountas and Pinnell reading  assessment, classroom tests, and writing assignments. The state scores also determine which children get additional RTI  services.  RTI/ ELLs will receive strong Tier 1 instruction, which focuses on developing literacy and language with a focus on  reading and writing skill and additional Tier's according to their data .     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Using the EDAT tool, and proficiency levels on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT, State ELA and Math, writing performance tasks and  classroom teacher data en forms us of the success of our programs.   The NYSESLAT scores indicate higher entering and  emerging patterns in grades K and 1.  These levels rise to expanding proficiency for many as early as 2nd grade, after attending  PS 191 for 2 years.  In general, grades 3-5 usually reach an expanding proficiency level if attendance has been consistent at PS  191.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The teams meet to look at student progress, meet with teachers and parents to  inform them of strategies to use to improve  student learning. Each teacher is provided data on the ELL students in his/her class. The teacher is given a spreadsheet with  the student name, proficiency level, NYSITELL/NYSESLAT score, ELA, and Math scores from the previous year. The ENL teacher  meets throughout the year with the administration and classroom teachers  to review scores and adjust programs accordingly  to student needs.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75         a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our school provides ELL services through the Freestanding English as a New Language program model. The ENL  teacher is dually certified in TESOL (grades K-12) as well as Childhood Education (grades 1-6). Students are grouped by  grade level and proficiency level. The integrated groups that are serviced are taught by the ENL teacher that pushes  into the classroom alongside the classroom teacher.  Most of our ENL students on each of the grade levels are in the  same class; if they are not in the same class they are pulled out into a group and serviced by the dually certified ENL  teacher.  The ENL teacher collaborates with the classroom teacher on a weekly basis so that students are receiving  instruction on the same skills in both classrooms.  Students that require services in the stand alone model receive  services in a pull-out group with the ENL teacher.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A     2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?     All of our students are serviced according to the changes that are mandated under CR Part 154.2. Students with entering and  emerging proficiency levels receive Stand Alone ENL in a pull out group with the ENL (dually certified in Common Branches and  TESOL) teacher for 180 minutes each week. These students also receive integrated ENL services for 180 minutes either in a pull  out or push in group. Students with a proficiency level of transitioning receive 90 minutes of stand alone ENL per week and 90  minutes of integrated ENL for a total of 180 minutes per week.Students with a proficiency level of expanding receive 180  minutes of integrated ENL per week. Students with a proficiency level of commanding receive services for 90 minutes a week  with the ENL teacher in a push in or pull out group. All students that are serviced in a pull out group are grouped with students  from no more than two contiguous grade spans.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   In our ENL program all classes are taught in English, using a balanced literacy approach in order to meet the Common Core  Learning Standards.  ELA and Social Studies are the core contents that are focused on. The ENL teacher uses various  techniques that include the use of visuals, manipulatives, bilingual dictionaries, thinking maps, and previewing content specific  vocabulary in order to foster ELLs language development and meet the demands of the Common Core Learning  Standards.   Lessons are differentiated to meet the various needs of our ENL students which will incorporate and hands-on  approach to learning along with technology.  Students that require native language support are given bilingual dictionaries or  iPads.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   ELL students that may require an evaluation in their home language are tested in their home language with the help of the  school based support team (SBST) and outside services. The SBST is responsible for coordinating evaluations for students in  their native language. If needed, a translator will be hired to assist the school with the screening process.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76      a. We currently do not have any SIFE students in our school.  However, the following programs and interventions are available  should any SIFE students be enrolled throughout the school year: AIS programs, ENL afterschool program. In addition, teachers  would implement strategies to help these students move forward such as establishing partnerships within classrooms. Flexible  and differentiated groupings would be established to meet these students' needs . ENL and AIS teachers could push-in to  provide additional support for these students. At-risk counseling would be provided by our Guidance Counselor and Parent  Coordinator would become a home-school liaison to enhance the partnerships between the school staff and the child's  family. b. Newcomers are paired with a "buddy" that speaks their home language, if possible.  Newcomers meet with the  school counselor and ENL teacher in order to help ease the transition into a new country and school. The ENL teacher works  alongside the classroom teacher to help make lessons comprehensible to newcomer students.c. Developing ELL students are  also paired with a partner in class that can serve as a language role model, a student who shows commanding proficiency of  the English language. The classroom teacher and ENL teacher plan for multiple entry points in their lessons in order to help  foster the language development of these developing ELL students.d. Long term ELL's schoolwork is evaluated to see which  modalities are in need of improvement. The ENL teacher then focuses on improving students' skills in these areas (listening,  speaking, reading, or writing.)e. Former ELLs are serviced for 90 minutes a week by the ENL teacher. The ENL teacher works  alongside the classroom teacher to determine areas that these students needs improvement in. The work is differentiated  depending on what the students needs to work on. The ENL teacher will provide services to these students by co-teaching with  the classroom teacher through a push in model.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   SWDs and ELLs receive intense reading and math exam preparation. Teachers that are trained in Wilson and Fundations work  with students that need additional help. Various computer programs such as BrainPop, BrainPop ESL, Starfall, and Raz-Kids are  also available for teachers of ELL-SWDs to use. In addtion, picture dictionaries, visuals, manipulatives,  thinking maps, and  scaffolding are utilized to help provide access to academic content area and to accelerate English language development for  these students.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school uses a combination of a push-in pull-out model in order for ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and to attain  English proficiency within the least restrictive environment. Flexible scheduling allows for this to take place throughout the  school day. As a special education team we meet to discuss the present levels of performance for each student who has an IEP.  Based on the child's performance and their IEP they are then flexibly programmed to receive services in an ICT, 12:1 or SETTS  program. Then they are mainstreamed throughout the day to participate in the General Ed curriculum alongside their non- disabled peers.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Intervention programs for ELLs include enVisions (each student has an individual account and login), Raz-Kids, BrainPop,  BrainPOP ESL, Fundations, SETSS, Speech Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, as well as the after school ENL  program that takes place once a week. Native language support is provided when necessary to students for the content  areas.  Students will use the enVisions Diagnostic Tools  to differentiate math instruction for our ELL students.  Hands on  projects and internet websites (visuals) will help students understand the Social Studies topics.  Fundations is used to assist  students struggling with phonics and sight words, handwriting, decoding, and reading fluency.  Since our science teacher has  the unique opportunity to work in the computer lab, she is able to modify her instruction to include computer programs such  as Sammy's Science House and online websites to support her instruction.  The science and math textbooks can be viewed  online and students can watch videos to assist with their learning both in school and at home.   Both the math and science  programs also have online components which emphasize vocabulary development where the students can see and listen to  the new words along with definitions.  Students requiring native language assistance are provided with iPads  in order to assist  them with their translations needs (google translate).      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We currently use ReadyGen reading and this year we will supplement it with Teacher's College Writing Units. There are other  programs that we are currently implementing  for the upcoming school year like Fundations, Wilson, Passport to Social  Studies  and Sanford Harmony Social Emotional Program.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all programs that the school offers. Students are invited to participate in the AIS afterschool  program. During the school day the ENL teacher provides remedial reading instruction and vocabulary development. All school  programs offered to non-ELL students are also offered to ELL students. These include the after school Family Academy, After  School Remedial Programs, Enrichment Programs such as Art, Music and grade performances which are afforded to the entire  school population.  Our ENL teacher contacts parents to encourage them to become a part of the school community and take  part in these activities throughout the year.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   Some examples of instructional materials in the ENL program include big books, trade books, language work books, a leveled  library, word and phonics games, videos, books on tape, and a variety of resource materials (picture dictionaries, idiom  dictionaries, thesauruses, and encyclopedias).  These materials are available to the entire school to be used within all  classrooms.  The ELL students also have access to a computer program, Raz-Kids.  This program deals with reading skills and  comprehension.  It provides support to the student through auditory and visual prompts.  This program is individualized so  that each student is reading books on their appropriate reading level. The after school program focuses on language  development and acquisition through the use of literacy. Ipads are given to students needing additonal language support .  These students have access to Google Translate, and bilingual picture dictionaries on the iPad. DuoLingo is another program  that is used to provide Native Language support.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   There are bilingual picture dictionaries provided to students that need home language support.  If there are any cognates in  books that are read in class, these are discussed and a word wall is created.  Cultural awareness is also an important part of  ENL. We also have an international feast day which incorporates cultural performances as well as foods native to the children's  various cultures. Native language support may be given in the Free Standing ENL programs in a variety of ways. Native  language libraries and textbooks are available for ELLs who require their support. Technology based programs such as Rosetta  Stone also offer native language support. In addition, classroom and support teachers may give native language support to  individual students on a case by case basis.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Required services/resources correspond to ELLs ages and grade appropriate levels.  enVisions is available to all students and  the content on each students' individual account is grade level appropriate.  The assignments can be varied based on individual  student's need.  The ENL teacher and our Special Education Liaison meet weekly to discuss students' needs and ensure that  resources support their needs within all classroom settings.  Teachers work together to scaffold and differentiate activities for  all students so that each student is performing at his/her maximum potential.  All required support services and resources for  ELLs are determined according to the individual students’ grade and ability as indicated by their NYSESLAT results.  Student  peers provide assistance to students who speak the same language when possible.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We share the building  with a District 75 school. Our Team includes a member of their school to help us align services and  assist each other where possible.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Families of ELL students are always welcome into our school to meet with teachers and ask questions about their children. We  have workshops that take place throughout the year for families to attend, which cover a variety of topics, including  information on programs that the students will be using throughout the year, websites that are helpful to use at home, etc.  New ELL students are invited to attend the afterschool ELL program which offers enrichment in English Language acquisition.  The Principal, Assistant Principal, parent coordinator, guidance counselor and ENL teacher are all involved in these  workshops.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ENL teacher will attend a monthly meeting with the district.  She will turn-key this information with the staff including all  non-pedagogic staff during Monday afternoon professional learning sessions every month.  Monthly congruence meetings are  held between ENL teacher and classroom teachers.  Updates on ENL methodologies, policies and testing are reviewed by the  ENL teacher and administration and then shared with all staff members.  In April the ENL teacher will discuss the NYSESLAT  with the staff and provide training to those teachers who will be administering it alongside her.  Prior to the NYS ELA, Math  and Science assessment the ENL teacher will review accommodations that students have available to them.   Teachers of  ELLs  attend PDs and workshops provided by the DOE and Queens North Field Support Center. They are also encouraged to  research on EngageNY and speak with the ENL teacher on strategies and methods that they can incorporate into their  classroom. The ELL teacher attends the same PD that classroom teachers do regarding the Common Core Learning Standards.  These Professional Learning sessions cover Ready Gen and the enVisions math program, which are aligned with the Common  Core.  A presenter from the enVisions math program works with our school and the ENL teacher has an opportunity work with  her to make sure that the program supports the ELL students' needs.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Agendas, conference notes and meeting sign in sheets from ENL professional development meetings that staff attend are  returned and noted by administration and teachers. They also keep a log of meetings attended  and credits earned. Emails  containing ENL meeting dates and locations of these certified meetings are posted and sent out to our staff.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL teacher and the Parent Coordinator work together to schedule annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to  dicuss the goals of the program, language development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language  development needs in all content areas. These meetings are scheduled after school hours, at a time that is convenient for the  parents. Translators are scheduled to be in the school building during these meetings.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.      Parents are involved throughout the entire school year at PS 191.  Information is sent home in translated versions or stamped  indicating for the parents to have the information translated. The following is a list of workshops for parents:September  2017:  Orientation for newcomers - ongoing for new admitsOctober 2017:  Homework help/strategies (update on continuing  students)November 2017:  Workshop for reading; International Food FestivalJanuary 2018:  Vocabulary enrichment, helping at  homeFebruary 2018:  Preparing for NYS Exams (ELS & Math) - Overview of exams helping at homeApril 2018:  Talent ShowMay  2018:  Summer Learning/Activities Other Options for parents:  PTA Meetings, Volunteering at PTA School Functions (book fair,  school festivals, etc.)   In addition, other parent involvement activities include: Family STEM Workshops:  Parents along with  their children are invited to attend monthly learning sessions.    Parent/Child Movie:  teacher models questioning techniques/writing/art projects while viewing a video (can be repeated at  home). Thanksgiving/American Holiday:  Create an edible food display for the dinner table.  This promotes family bonding and  knowledge of American history. Game Afternoon:  Parent/child partner or compete in simple word/math games (scrabble,  bingo, etc). Awards Ceremony:  Culmination activity/Celebration (parent helpers/guests).  Gifts and refreshments to recognize  individual student growth/achievement in the Title III ENL after school program. The ENL teacher, Parent Coordinator, and  multilingual school nurse are present during these activities to aid in translations and make parents feel at home in their  neighborhood school. Translators are hired during parent teacher conferences to aid in translation needs for parents. The over  the phone translation services that are provided by the DOE are also used if necessary.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Michael Ranieri, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Mayflower School                                                                              School DBN: 26Q191  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The ENL teacher, parents of ELLs, parent coordinator, PTA President, and Leadership Team were consulted with in  reviewing our school's written and oral translation policies. After reviewing Home Language Identification  Surveys, environmental surveys, and speaking with the parents of our ELL students through translators, we came  up with a plan to ensure that all parents are provided with appropriate and timely information in a language that  they are able to understand. In order to determine the language preferences of the parent community, the RAPL  report in ATS is generated.

A Welcome Poster is located near the front entrance so that it is clearly visible to parents. A Language ID Guide is also  located at the front security desk as well as in the main office. We provide parents with a translation of any document  that contains individual, student-specific information regarding a student's health, safety, legal or disciplinary matters,  entitlement to public education, or placement into any special education setting. When the Translation and  Interpretation Unit or if our school is temporarily unable to provide the required translation into one or more covered  languages, we have a parent or staff member assist us. We also use a stamp notifying the parent to have the  information translated. We post this information near the front entrance of our school in each of the covered  languages, or most prominent covered languages, indicating the availability of interpretation services.    Our school's safety plan contains procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language access services are not  prevented from reaching the school's administrative offices solely due to language barriers. In addition, the  Department of Education's website provides information in different languages concerning the rights of parents to  translation and interpretation services and how to access such services. Parents who wish to receive language access  services are encouraged to contact us and we will assist them in translating the information orally or in written form.  We provide oral translations during the regular school day using our school nurse, occupational therapist, physical  therapist, paraprofessionals, school aides, teachers and parent volunteers all of whom speak most of the languages  spoken by the parents of our school community.                  Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Our school will use the parent surveys that are given to the parents during the first back to school night in September  and then again in January to gather the feedback from parents that will allow us to determine their opinion about the  quality and availability of translation and interpretation services. We also review the results of the yearly Learning  Environment Survey that parents complete for the DOE. We have an open door policy and parents can speak to the  Principal, Assistant Principal, ENL teacher, and other staff members along with our Parent Coordinator to ensure that  their needs are being met. Our ENL teacher also meets with parents 3 /4 times a year through our After-school Title III  Program to discuss their needs and how we can improve our services.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          87
