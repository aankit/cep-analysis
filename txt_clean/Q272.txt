This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of the George Washington Carver High School for the Sciences is to raise the knowledge, skills and  opportunities of every student to meet the New York State educational standards and complete the Regents diploma  graduation requirements within four years as each student develops the requisite skills needed to become a lifelong  learner.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    George Washington Carver High School for the Sciences is an academically rigorous small school which focuses  primarily on science education.

In addition to the academic aspects, the  physical, emotional and social well-being of our student populace will be nurtured through advisories and after school  programs serviced in a small, safe and personalized learning community.   George Washington Carver High School for the Sciences enjoys collaborations with the Advance Placement Access for  All Partnership Initiative which enables students to increase participation and performance in Advanced Placement  Courses; Expanded Success Initiative which provides opportunities that will increase career access and success for all  students with special emphasis on African American and Latino young men; School Time Lab which facilitates the  effective use of time to create a schedule that supported the school’s vision and goals for our students; Connect with  Kids which provides documentary-style videos, evidence-based curricula and books to guide and improve student  behavior, parent involvement and school culture; Queens College, CUNY, Investigative Science Fair Program; College  Now at York College, CUNY, which provides high school students the opportunity to take College Level Classes while  they are completing their high school program of study and College Access for All.    George Washington Carver High School for the Sciences is located in the Springfield Gardens environs in South East  Queens. This independent high school is housed within the Springfield Educational Complex on the second floor and  serves a current culturally diverse population of 427 students. The space occupied in the shared facility is well-kept,  where pride in the students’ accomplishment is evident in the prominently displayed students’ work.   Overview of Instructional Programs and Special Initiatives   The philosophy of the George Washington Carver High School for the Sciences is based on the belief that, given the  opportunity and resources in an environment that promotes learning and growth, all students can achieve and all are  capable of excellence through support and encouragement provided by the school through its two independent  programs – the Carver Research Institute and the Veterinary Science Institute where each is designed to challenge  each student to think independently and to be resourceful.    The Carver Research Institute encourages all students to conduct an investigation where everything else is kept  constant while changing a single variable. This ability presents an effective general strategy for solving many problems  that students encounter in school, at home, the workplace and in everyday life. Students are also given the  opportunities to work with dedicated professionals beyond the everyday science classroom where they learn and  further develop skills in problem solving, communication, and thinking skills that they will need to be effective  workers and citizens of the 21st Century. Such strategies have enabled students to work at their maximum potential  to achieve their learning outcomes. Students will be expected to conduct research and participate in field  experiences, symposia, expositions, and competitions.    The Veterinary Science Institute is designed to provide students with in-depth knowledge and a fundamental  understanding of the theoretical concepts utilized in Veterinary Science through genuine hands-on, inquiry based  laboratory, field experiences and problem solving as they develop techniques and skills used in the field of Veterinary  Science including the handling, care and maintenance of small animals. Veterinary Science classes stress hands-on  experiences with theory. Students will engage in the theory and practice of Veterinary Science laboratory techniques  and technology through hands-on activities and simulations. Our facility houses a selected variety of species of  animals, where students learn humane care and become proficient in the handling of animals. Our staff has extensive  training and experience in this field.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      In both programs, students are required to pursue their regular sequence of science classes to meet their  requirements for graduation. The overarching goal is to ensure that all students graduate with the knowledge and  skills necessary to make successful transitions to college and careers.       3.

Strengths:   ● 89% of families say that the principal encourages feedback from the community through regular meetings (2017- 2018 School Quality Guide).   89% of families say that the principal is strongly committed to shared decision making (2017-2018 School Quality  Guide).   94% of teachers say that the principal sets high standards for student learning (2017-2018 School Quality Guide).   94% of teachers say that the principal carefully tracks student academic progress (2017-2018 School Quality Guide).   Needs:   ● 62% of students say that they learn a lot from feedback on their work (2017-2018 School Quality Guide). Feedback  provided by teachers to students is not data driven, very general, and does not provide specific next steps for  learning, limiting teachers’ abilities to make strategic and purposeful modifications to lessons to meet the immediate  learning needs of all students.   ● This leads us to believe that the instructional staff needs to receive training on data usage to drive student  achievement.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. George Washington Carver High School for the Sciences in compliance with  the Section 1118 of Title I, and ESSA, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      George Washington Carver High School for the Sciences will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The assessment tools and data sources used to determine the literacy skills of ENLs are ENL Periodic Assessments, NYSITELL,  NYSESLAT and RNMR Modality data.  The information gleaned from the data showed that there has been improvement in the  academic performance of ENLs, but, more importantly allows for specific interventions that could be employed for the  individual student.  Hence, differentiated instruction.   Instructional staff also will be able to monitor and adjust instruction  more efficiently since the NYSESLAT Modality Report provides information to determine student deficiencies in listening,  speaking, reading and writing.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         The structures utilized to support this effort include disaggregation and analysis of the data to understand the areas where  students will need support.  This data is also compared with the previous year's data to determine movement as well as the  specific areas for intervention.  Strategies to address areas which need improvement are employed and are integrated into the  lessons to address the individual learning needs.  These strategies are reflected in the lesson planning.    To support the  Reading component, students are enrolled in the Achieve 3000 Program which focuses on the improvement of Reading  Comprehension Skills.  In addition, teachers integrate contextual considerations and cultural backgrounds of students into  lesson planning.  Instructional staff attend ongoing professional development which addresses the needs of ENL students.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of the ENL program will be evaluated through the NYSESLAT results, successful credit accumulation as an indicator  of classes passed and advancement to the next grade level, Regents examinations passed and graduation rate.  In addition,  ENLs are further evaluated based on class work assignments, tests, ongoing summative and formative assessments, and  student self-evaluations and assessments.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We provide targeted interventions through Achieve 3000 to support reading and comprehension.  After school content- specific  tutorials and Regents Preparatory Review sessions are offered.  Glossaries and dictionaries are provided to foster  literacy skills acquisition.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N. A.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   A comparison of the data was conducted for the 2016 and 2017 performance results.  An analysis of the results revealed  that 31 students took the NYSESLAT Examinations in 2017 as compared with 16 in 2016.  There were 16 students who took the  examinations in both 2016 and 2017.  Where the performances in the modalities were concerned, there were improvements  in various modalities in 2017.  There was a 75% increase in listening, 50% increase in speaking, 62.5% increase in reading and  81.25% increase in the writing modality.   In addition,  there were 5 students who achieved at the Commanding  level.   Students currently enrolled -  6.5% are Emerging, 29% are Transitioning and 64.5% are Expanding.  Students who take  the NYSITELL are placed according to their cut score performance on the examination.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The information is communicated with the Guidance Counselor and programmer to ensure that students are placed in their  correct classes according to CR Part 154.  Parents are notified about the child's status in the ENL Program through mailings in  their preferred language and in English as well as individualized workshops .  Instructional and School Support Staff receive the  information through Inquiry Team and Grade Level Team Meetings.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         All ENLs are programmed for the mandated units of ENL.  Students at the Emerging levels receive instructions in a  homogeneous setting via the stand alone model with the ENL teacher as mandated.  These students are also placed in  an integrated heterogenous ELA class for the mandated allocation of minutes as stipulated in CR Part 154.  Students  at the Transitional, Expanding and Commanding levels are scheduled for one period of integrated ENL through ELA or  Social Studies following the mandated allocation of minutes as stipulated by CR Part 154 in a heterogeneous  classroom setting.      b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   All ENLs are programmed for the mandated units of ENL.  Students at the Emerging levels receive instructions in a  homogeneous setting via the stand alone model with the ENL teacher as mandated one period per day, five times per  week.  These students are also placed in an integrated heterogenous ELA class for the mandated allocation of minutes as  stipulated in CR Part 154 one period per day, five days per week.  The ENL Teacher pushes into this class four days per  week.  Students at the Transitional, Expanding and Commanding levels are scheduled for one period of integrated ENL through  ELA or Social Studies following the mandated allocation of minutes as stipulated by CR Part 154 in a heterogeneous  classroom setting.  The ENL Teacher pushes into this class four days per week.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.    All content areas are taught in English, however teachers differentiate instruction to accommodate ENL  students.  Dictionaries, glossaries, and specific vocabulary for subject areas are also used, and scaffolding techniques.  The ESL  teacher and the content area teachers meet to discuss students' progress and to assist with techniques of how to work with  ENL students.  Teachers are also encouraged to participate in workshops and professional development related to quality  teaching for English Language Learners. Content areas deliver instruction following the standards for ENL, ELA and the  Standards for specific content areas.  This is accomplished through the use of a differentiated instructional framework that  includes explicit instruction, careful modeling, coaching, scaffolding, group discussion, problem solving, cooperative learning  groups, flexible grouping as well as ensuring that students practice opportunities and expectations for independent  applications to help student meet and/or exceed NYS and City standards.  Leveled reading materials, manipulatives, graphic  organizers, non-verbal and context clues are utilized to provide meaning for instruction and to promote success.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?    By evaluating foreign transcripts, by administering the NYSITELL, and by utilizing Teachers with the same native language for  translation services and academic support.  Additionally the Spanish LAB is administered to new Spanish Speaking  students.            5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.

Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    A SIFE students will attend one-on-one tutoring, read aloud activities, phonemic awareness instruction, fluency, spelling,  guided reading and writing, modeled writing, shared writing, audio books-listening, pronunciation and reading, visual  opportunities through technology and film and the use of manipulatives.  The use of the native language will be an integral   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      part of the academic intervention.     b. The school will give Newcomers many opportunities to read and write in meaningful contexts in their first and second  languages.  Draw on effective strategies for increasing literacy skills in their native language, that will promote English  language acquisition.  Draw on their background experiences and encourage connections between academic concepts and  students' cultural background.  Help students see the value of being able to communicate in multiple languages.  Connect with  students' families and culture.  Incorporate culture and native language, introduce multicultural literature, and draw on the  expertise on community members.  Give ENL students opportunities to teach others about their first language and home  culture.   Use effective strategies such as project-based learning, thematic instruction, and cooperative grouping to engage all  learners.  Give students opportunities to talk about shared learning experiences.  Hands-on experiential learning experiences  will develop understanding.  Help ENL students connect words with meaning by using nonverbal clues and non-linguistic  representation of ideas, including multimedia, manipulatives, simulations and modeling.  Vary assessment strategies.  Use  wide-ranging assessments, including observations, portfolios, and performance assessments.          c. ENL students have additional after-school help, one-to-one tutoring, and lunch time readings with a teacher or a peer  buddy.  Students also have the opportunity to participate in extended day activities such as after-school, Regents preparation  and tutorial sessions.  This will help them to further acquire the skills and subject content needed to pass the Regents  examinations.  Students and parents participate in individual and group counseling to keep both students and parents abreast  of their academic progress as well as graduation requirements.  Our instructional program places additional emphasis on the  writing, reading, and listening component.  We have established a successful reading and writing program by implementing  the following practices:  -Conducting explicit instruction of skill.  Students will write often and use their peers in the classroom as their  audience.  Students will work with partners to plan, write, and edit and provide ongoing feedback with one another.  By  examining the feedback and work of others, students will have ongoing opportunities to learn new words, and understand the  mechanics of writing.   -Setting classroom protocols.  The focus will be on the protocols of writing.  Activities will include the understanding of the  writing process, rules, and routines of writing and reading comprehension.  Students will be taught what to do during the  editing stages and conference with one another.  Dictionaries and glossaries, and highlighter will be used to facilitate the  process.  The teachers will manage time within the diverse writing activities but also incorporating writing across the  curriculum.  There will also be a computer workstation with directions for accessing direct instruction on all the protocols and  skills programs, the Internet and word processing programs.  -Set high standards for writing.  Although we implement all the learning standards in our ENL classes, we also need to  challenge every child with an enriched curriculum, which includes direct instruction on all the protocols and skills needed to be  a successful writer.  d. Long-term ENLs will work with content area teachers, especially ELA teachers.  They will work with vocabulary  development,   reading comprehension and techniques for completing multiple choice questions.  In addition, students will work with  Guidance Counselor in class placement; meet with students to discuss progress; provide support where necessary to advance  within college and career readiness and master skills needed to graduate, enroll in college, and have a productive career.     e.  All ENLs that have reached commanding levels for up to 2 years received .5 unit of integrated ENL through ELA or Social  Studies.  They also receive all ENLs testing accommodations in addition to counseling.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Instruction and grade level materials teachers use that both provide academic content areas and accelerate English language  development include:  Jigsaw reading techniques, Round Robin, Think-Pair-Share, double-entry journals, differentiated  instruction, scaffolding appropriate text level readers, and the use of native language materials.  The ENL teacher provide the  mandated unit of instruction and differentiate the delivery according to student's IEP.  Currently, there are 2 students  designated as ENL-SWD.  One student requires bilingual support in Haitian Creole.  However,  a Bilingual Paraprofessional  (Haitian Creole language speaking) supports the student in the content area classes.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ENL-SWDs within the least restrictive  environment includes weekday after-school programs . Students who are ENL-SWD are enrolled in ICT classes.  The lessons are  differentiated to meet the individual needs of students.  The instructional strategies include cooperative learning, role-playing,  the use of modeling, graphic organizers and visuals, concept mapping, vocabulary and language development, guided  interactions, scaffolding and the use of computer assisted instruction.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention programs for ENLs in ELA, math, and other content areas include after-school programs, small groups  according to individual weaknesses.  ENLs meet with content area teachers for individual tutoring: ELA, Math, Social Studies,  and Science teachers.  The use of the native language is reinforced during these interventions in the form of glossaries,  bilingual dictionaries and peer-tutoring.  The content areas teachers that speak the students' language also provide additional  support. Students are selected based on their progress and report-card data.  ENL students participate in the After-School  tutorials and extended day Saturday Regents review and preparation programs.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      The school will continue to improve the delivery of instruction to support the ENL's in their current content classes so that they  will meet and exceed the benchmarks for the Common Core standards.  The data gathered from the benchmark assessments  will  allow for us to continue Tier One interventions within daily class instruction.  George Washington Carver High School for  the Sciences will continue to use Achieve 3000 during this academic year.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?

ENL students in our school are encouraged to participate in all school programs including sports, clubs, and shows.  ENL  students are exposed to school-wide advertisements for all programs.  ENL students are encouraged to participate in all school  activities.  Funding sources for extra-curricular school activities include school per-session budget for staff members.    All  after-school activities such as clubs, tutoring, sports, and begin at 2:30 p.m. until 4:00 p.m on Wednesdays, Thursdays and  Fridays .       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The Achieve 3000 Program has been successful in helping ENL Students with reading and comprehending informational  texts.  This is evident in the increase of their lexile level scores. Teachers of content area use computers, overhead projectors,  and power point presentations, as well as glossaries and specific vocabulary to support ENL students.  Bilingual glossaries,  bilingual dictionaries, buddy system are used as native language support during content instruction.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   The native language support is given through the buddy system where senior ENL students assist incoming ENL  students.  Encouragement is also given to ENL students by staff members who are native language speakers in other content  areas.    These are in addition to bilingual glossaries, bilingual dictionaries, computers with translation applications, buddy  system are used as native language support during content instruction.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         ENL students are placed in grade levels based on the number of credits earned.  Grade and age levels are determined as per  the evaluation of foreign transcripts.  Required services, support, and resources will be identified as per the needs of each  individual ENL student.  If necessary, students will be directed to the resource center and other one-on-one tutoring.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Teachers of content area use computers, overhead projectors, and power point presentations, as well as glossaries and  specific vocabulary to support ENL students. Bilingual glossaries, bilingual dictionaries, buddy system are used as native  language support during content instruction.  All ENL teachers in the building attend professional learning activities  together.  The information gleaned is then turn-keyed to the staff in the various schools.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Activities for new incoming students include orientation by the Guidance Counselor where students will receive information in  their native language such as important areas in the school building, clubs where students can be assigned to a buddy, and  peer tutoring using native language as well as English. Translation is provided by staff members where possible.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N. A.       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The Professional Learning Opportunities support the school instructional focus which is Writing across the disciplines using  academic vocabulary, reading comprehension and evidence to support claims, generate hypotheses, pose arguments and solve  real world problems.  George Washington Carver High School for the Sciences staff, (Principal,  APs , all content area teachers,  the special education teachers, ENL teacher, guidance counselors, paraprofessionals, social worker, and secretaries).  They all  participate in ongoing, long term targeted professional development with strong emphasis on Vocabulary acquisition, Writing  across the disciplines and reading comprehension strategies.   Reinforcement of the Framework is also emphasized to ensure  high quality of lesson delivery to yield student achievement.  In addition, teachers from all content areas meet once a week to  work on the school inquiry focus targeting low performing students.  The targeted population are mainly ENLs and English  speaking students from the Caribbean.  Both subgroups display SIFE like characteristics with low literacy skills. George  Washington Carver High School for the Sciences utilizes Achieve 3000 and receive  professional development from the  vendor.    All teachers at George Washington Carver High School for the Sciences are teachers of ENLs.  Professional development is  offered in argumentative writing, using counterclaims, using evidence, vocabulary acquisition and questioning  techniques.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         2.

Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Through targeted Social and Emotional Learning, the staff is provided with materials that integrate all students into discussions  and assimilation of the school culture.   The ENL Teacher attend PD provided by the DOE which is turn-keyed to the rest of the  staff.  Professional development is provided every Monday as per Chancellor's Regulations.  Meeting agendas and minutes are  archived in a binder.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?

Sutton, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   George Washington Carver High                                                                              School DBN: 29Q272  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
