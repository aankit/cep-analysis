The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our mission statement is to provide all students optimal learning opportunities in order to reach their full academic  and social potential. We commit to working collaboratively to ensure each student and their family, has a positive  experience with their involvement at CS150. We will ensure student success by providing access for all students to a  rigorous curriculum in a nurturing environment with a staff that is committed to excellence in education.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   At CS150, both students and staff represent diverse backgrounds that add to a very rich and accepting school culture.  The school is located in a high-poverty area of the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx. Administrative and  instructional staff includes the Principal, two Assistant Principals, 66 teachers and specialists, 2 social workers and 5  paraprofessionals. The school serves Pre-Kindergarten through Fifth Grade in general, bilingual, and special education.  The student body is comprised of approximately 860 students who are 76.83% Hispanic, 19.91% African American,  0.35% Asian, 2.44% White, and .47% Other.    Instruction in the content areas is enhanced by content-specific cluster teachers. Science, Dance, Technology, Library,  Visual Arts, and Physical Education instruction is provided in a dedicated instructional space. This school year we will  continue to have two gym teachers in order to provide all students with more access to physical education classes.  Technology will continue to be provided utilizing two (2) Technology Labs. Students will be serviced by one science  cluster in the Science Lab. A Literacy Coach, and a Math Coach will provide training and support for classroom  teachers across all grade levels. In addition, a new teacher mentor will continue to support un-tenured teachers in  developing effective pedagogical practices. We will continue to have a DOE Universal Literacy Coach to work with K-2  teachers. There will also be a Reading Recovery teacher who will provide Academic Intervention Services to lower  grade students.    Through grant writing, we have managed to attain additional funds that have helped to further enhance the programs  at CS 150 for students and parents. Many of the programs have improved the existing school curriculum and  programs in performing arts (e.g.: instrumental and choral music programs, literacy and dance). The following is a list  of grants and enrichment programs that are provided to students at CS150:   1. My Own Book Fund allows every 3 rd grade student to go on a shopping spree at a local Barnes & Noble bookstore  with a $50 gift card to help build personal home libraries.   2. Literacy Inc. provides our school with the Buddy Reading Program, Literacy Celebrations, and the Very Involved  Parent (VIP) program.    3. The African, Latin, Jazz Alliance Program provides music instruction, utilizing various wind and percussion  instruments, to students in grades 3-4. The program culminates in a concert to which parents are invited and students  collaborate to perform as a band.   4. The Marquis Studios Program provides art education to students in grades 1-4. Art instructors introduce students  to different art techniques that encourage student exploration. At the end of each semester (grades 1-2 and grades 3- 4) participating students host an art exhibit.   5. Chess in the Schools program teaches students to play chess in order to develop their critical thinking skills and  problem-solving abilities. The program will promote discipline, focus, and enhancement of cognitive skills.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      6.

English Language Learners make up 24.4% of the student population; the vast majority of these students are from  Spanish-speaking households. In the last couple of years there has been an increase in the amount of Arabic students.  In meeting the special needs of its students, CS150 has six bilingual classes, an ENL program, and twelve special  education classes, as well as specialized staff to provide additional push-in and pull-out instructional support services.  Some of the needs identified for these sub-groups has been to further develop academic language, provide tasks that  are differentiated and develop phonics skills to support reading.   In an effort to further enhance instruction, each staff developer provides small group instruction for at-risk students.  A team of dedicated related services staff provides additional support to English Language Learners and at-risk Special  Education students in English Language Arts and Mathematics.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The school-wide instructional focus for the 2018-2019 school year is to engage in cycles of data analysis to monitor  student progress toward meeting goals, across grade and subject areas, using school-wide common assessments.  Teacher teams and instructional leaders will utilize the results to adjust curricula and instruction so that all  students, including ELLs and SWDs, demonstrate an increase in student performance.   In the 2017-2018 school year our school made progress in designing instruction through a vertical instructional team.  This team worked collaboratively throughout the year to develop curriculum maps, and ELA/Math tasks in order to  provide cohesive Common Core aligned instruction in grades K-5. In addition, teachers this school year enhanced their  collaborative practices by working in grade level PLCs to develop grade wide goals and analyze student work samples  to inform instruction and lesson plan collaboratively. This practice will enhance rigorous instruction in the classroom  and support best practices in all content area learning. Through purposeful and rigorous instruction, we strive to  make each and every student college and career ready.                   2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 12X150   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   857   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

As the NYS ELA  is   aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards, we need to engage students in intellectual activities and develop  critical   thinking skills in all subject areas to better our students for academic success.       Our NYS ELA subgroup results for 2017-2018 indicate that English Language Learners in grades 3-5 performed as follows:  Level 1   60%, Level 2 33%, Level 3 7%, Level 4 0%. When analyzing achieving performance levels of students in grades 3- 5 that  performed   on or above grade level, we have found that there is a need to develop students’ academic language and writing that is  supported   by textual evidence.       Our NYS ELA subgroup results for 2017-2018 indicate that students with disabilities in grades 3-5 performed as follows:  Level 1 71%,   Level 2 22%, Level 3 7%, Level 4 0%. When analyzing achieving performance levels of students in grades 3- 5 that  performed on or   above grade level, we have found that there is a need for vocabulary development and content analysis.       Our NYS Math results from 2017-2018 indicate that in fifth grade 29.3% performed at a level 3 or level 4. In the fourth  grade 23%   performed at a level 3 or level 4. When analyzing achieving performance levels of students in grades 4 & 5 that  performed on or   above grade level, we have found that there is a need to develop students’ problem solving skills and critical thinking in   Mathematics in order to bridge the achievement gap.

When  examining the proficiency levels, the data shows that there is a high concentration of expanding students in grades K-5.  The Data shows that students Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills are far more developed than their Cognitive  Academic Language Proficiency. In order to become English proficient English Language Learners (ELL) must develop  their academic English. Based on a review of the NYSESLAT, NYS ELA and NYS Math data we have identified that  developing academic language, reading and writing skills will support all learners. Common Core aligned curriculum  needs to be modified both for English Language Learners and Students with Special Needs in order to provide multiple  entry points into the curriculum.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Our school conducted a comprehensive needs-assessment aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Our focus is  on the element of Effective Leadership. We gathered and analyzed a variety of quantitative and qualitative data sources  such as Advance Measures of Teacher Practice (MOTP), NYS ELA & Math Common Core Exam scores, and Quality Review  report. We analyzed the trends in data and summarized the most significant student performance trends. This work is  summarized below:   Data Source: Advance Measures of Teacher Practice (MOTP) June 2018   In Domain D3: Instruction, 24.76% of teachers at CS150 were rated Developing and 2.91% of teachers were rated  Ineffective. In component 3b: Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques, 17.96% of teachers were rated Developing.  In component 3c: Engaging Students in Learning, 27.67% of teachers were rated Developing and 3.40% Ineffective. This  data shows that approximately ¼ of our teaching staff need further professional learning in the Domain of Instruction  with a focus on 3c: Engaging Students in Learning.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           31      Data Source: Quality Review 2016-2017      Our 2016-2017 Quality Review report identifies a rating for each Quality Review Indicator. We received a rating of Well  Developed   on 1.4 Positive School Culture, Proficient on 1.1 Curriculum, 1.3 Leveraging Resources, 4.1 Teacher Support and  Supervision, and 5.1   Monitoring and Revising Systems. We received a developing in 1.2 Pedagogy and in 2.2 Assessment. The findings in the  Quality   Review report indicate that school-wide assessments need to be further analyzed and used to refine instruction for a  diversity of   learners, including English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities so they can have access to the curricula and  are all   cognitively engaged. These findings further support the need for a more rigorous and differentiated approach to our  Professional   Learning plan.      Data Source- NYS ELA and Math Common Core Exam   Our NYS ELA results from 2017-2018 indicated that in third grade 33% of students performed at level 3 or level 4, in  fourth grade   26.1% performed at level 3 or level 4, and in fifth grade 23% performed at a level 3 or level 4. When comparing  achieving   performance levels of students in grades 3-5 that performed on or above grade level, we have found that there is an  increase   demand for teachers to collaborate and further develop rigorous instruction that aligns to the Common Core Learning  Standards   in order to bridge the achievement gap. As the NYS ELA is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards, we need to  engage   students in intellectual activities and develop critical thinking skills to prepare our students for academic success.      Our NYS Math results from 2017-2018 indicated that in third grade 31.2% of students performed at level 3 or level 4, in  fourth grade       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           32      23% performed at level 3 or level 4, and in fifth grade 29.3% performed at a level 3 or level 4. When comparing  achieving   performance levels of students in grades 3-5 that performed on or above grade level, we have found that there is a need  to   develop students’ problem solving skills, number sense and critical thinking in mathematics in order to bridge the  achievement   gap.      Based on the 2016-2017 Quality Review report, and NYS ELA and Math Common Core Exams data, we have identified  that there is   a need for more professional learning in the domain of instruction with a focus on 3c) Engaging Students in Learning and   3b) Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.   By June 2019, school leaders will create and implement a professional development plan that builds teachers’ capacity  to use questioning and discussion protocols for all students. As a result, there will be a 8% increase in teachers  improving one performance level as reflected in component 3c) Engaging Students in Learning, in Advance. This will  directly increase NYS ELA & MATH student performance levels by 5%.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           33     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this  Framework for Great Schools element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Our school conducted a comprehensive needs assessment aligned with the Framework for Great Schools by focusing on  the element, Strong Family and Community Ties. We analyzed the results of the school environment survey, parent  workshop participation logs and Year-To-Date (YTD) Attendance . The following are the findings and trends in  performance of the three data sources listed above.    Data Source - Parent Environment Survey    Findings: Our school environment survey showed that only 67% of parents participated in the survey. Therefore 33% of  parents at C.S. 150 did not complete the school environment survey. Although these percentages showed an increase of  13% in survey responses when compared to last year's survey, the current data indicates that parent participation needs  to improve in order to support family and community ties.   Data Source- Parent Participation Logs       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           37      Findings: Our parent workshop logs during Parent Association meetings show that 5% of parents participate. Data  reveals that 95% of parents don't attend these meetings. There is a need to improve parent participation during Parent  Association meetings in order to support the academic progress of our students.   Findings: Our parent logs during School Wide Events show that an average of 15% of parents participate. Data reveals  that 85% of parents do not participate in these events. There is a need to improve parent participation during school  wide events to support the academic progress of our students.   Data Source - Current Year Monthly Attendance   Findings: According to ATS Report (RYMA) during the months of Sept. - Dec., the school maintained 91.40% attendance  rate. However from Jan. - April, attendance dropped to 88%. It was also observed that attendance rate went up in the  month of May to 90.43%. In summary, our school percentages are indicating a YTD attendance of 89.80%. The data  indicates that attendance rate needs to improve to meet the Chancellor's Regulation and NYCDOE expectations.    Based on the data from, Parent Environment Survey, Parent Workshop logs, and Current Year Monthly Attendance, we  have identified a need to develop committees (Attendance, Parent /Teacher) comprised of teachers, paraprofessionals  and parents to increase academic progress, parent engagement, and student attendance that will promote college and  career readiness and close the achievement gap for students at C.S. 150.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.   By June 2019, our C.S.150 staff will collaborate with parents to establish committees for school-wide events that  promote academic success, parent engagement and student attendance. This will support content area learning in the  classroom and an increase in parent engagement by 10% as measured by parent participation logs, Parent Environment  Surveys and 2% increase in student attendance as measured by ATS - RYMA Report.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           38     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this  Framework for Great Schools element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teachers are provided with common planning time vertically in grades Pre-K-5 to discuss measures of student  learning and assessment tools available. During this school year, we will continue to have a PD & Instructional  committee to critically think about assessment measures and develop rigorous instructional practices that support  student achievement. This MOSL team makes decisions regarding assessments as it relates to Advanced. Inquiry  teams in grades K-5 will make assessment decisions to support ongoing monitoring of growth as it relates to NYC ELA  performance assessments. Teachers will engage in various cycles of data analysis througout the school year and  examine student work samples to make curriculum/instructional shifts. Professional development will be provided  throughout the school year to address the achievement gaps as noted in school-wide common assessments. In grades  K-5, teachers provide students with DRA2 assessment periodically throughout the school year and results are  summarized by grade and students are grouped based on data.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           54           Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           55      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. CS 150, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      C.S.150 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology.     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;     The school’s Parent Involvement        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           56         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.        In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing  technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;      maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;         provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State   accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality  Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;     host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise   parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right  to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118  and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act.  schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the  Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;               The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           57              holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;    hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school   year;     encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-  Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  supporting or hosting Family Day events;       establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;    encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;    providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their   children’s progress;     developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about   school activities and student progress;     providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a   format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Both students and  staff represent a diversity of backgrounds that add to a very rich and accepting school  culture.  The school is located in a high-poverty area of the Hunts Point section of the South  Bronx. At our school we service our English Language Learners via our ENL or Transitional  Bilingual Programs.   Data  At C.S.150 there is a trend in the way ELL students perform in the four competences, as per the  NYSESLAT.  In the strands of Listening and Speaking students seem to perform significantly  better than Reading and Writing.  The Data below shows that students' Basic Interpersonal  Communicative Skills are far more developed than their Cognitive Academic Language  Proficiency.  In order to become English proficient ELL students must develop their academic  language in English.  NYSESLAT Data  Findings: Student results in grades K-5 on the 2017 NYSESLAT indicated that 32% of our  students scored at the Entering and Emerging levels, 20% at the Transitioning level, 36% at the  Expanding level, and 12% at the Commanding level.  There is a large concentration of  Transitioning and Expanding students in grades 3-5 averaging out 61% . When examining the  proficiency levels, the data shows that 52% of the students in grades K-2 are in the Transitioning  and Expanding levels. The Data shows that students Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills  are far more developed than their Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency. In order to become  English proficient English Language Learners must develop their academic English to reach the  commanding level.   NYS ELA Data:  Findings: In the NYS ELA data for grades 3-5, English Language Learners performed as  follows: 51% at level 1, 39% at a level 2, 10% at level 3, and 0% at level 4.  When comparing  the NYSESLAT and NYS ELA, 10% of ELLs performed at level 3 that were at the Expanding  and Commanding levels. This data shows a need for more content area learning with a focus on  academic language.  Based on a review of the NYSESLAT and NYS ELA data we have identified that co-teaching  will support ENL and content area instruction.  Developing academic language, reading and  writing skills to move along the five levels of progression is our goal.     Rationale for proposed program:  Based on our needs assessment findings of English Language Learners, we have concluded that  the major deficiencies are in reading and writing.  Our goal is to provide enriched support for       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   struggling ELLs, which include students with Interrupted Formal Education and ELLs that have  IEPs.   We will design a program for our First through Fifth Grade Bilingual/ENL population that will  provide support in English Language Arts for Transitioning and Expanding students.  The  language of instruction will be English with an academic intervention approach.  Instructional  staff will provide opportunities for students to build oral language, vocabulary, listening/reading  comprehension, and writing in the English language.  The after school program will run for  29 sessions from October 17, 2018 through January 31, 2019 on Wednesdays and  Thursdays,  from 2:25 pm to 4:25 pm. It will be offered to ELL students in bilingual classes and  selected ENL students that are in need of academic intervention services.  There will be 6  classes, 1 first grade, 1 second grade, 1 third grade, 2 fourth grade, 1 fifth grade and a content  teacher with a specialty in technology.  Each class will have 20 students and 1 Bilingual or  ESOL certified teacher, with a content area teacher for selected periods. An Assistant Principal  will oversee the program to ensure its correct implementation as well as monitor student progress  and attendance at no cost to Title III funds. A school aide and an ENL staff developer will be  assigned to the Title III After School Program to maintain attendance records and send parent  notifications in parents' preferred languages.  These services will be provided at no cost to Title  III funds.   Another goal of this program is to strengthen the students’ English language skills by providing  additional support using ENL methodologies through a thematic approach. The language of  instruction will be primarily English with appropriate language scaffolding. During the two  hours of instruction students will work on listening, speaking, reading, and writing  activities.  Students will be engaged in whole class shared reading, guided reading, and writing  strategies and techniques.   In addition, all students who are Transitioning and Expanding as  determined by the NYSESLAT will have an I-Ready NYS CCLS Reading online program  license.  This license will allow the students to have daily access to listening, reading, and  vocabulary activities that will support English development.  The program will monitor student  progress and tailor instruction to individual student needs.  The Home Language will be  supported through the use of bilingual dictionaries, small group instruction, the buddy system  (pairing students at different progression levels together, to support each other), and classroom  libraries that include books in their native language.   We will use Write Time For Kids in grades K-5, which offers engaging resources to support  students in writing and help teachers model and explicitly demonstrate the steps of the writing  process.  Write Time For Kids uses modeled and shared writing to demonstrate, teach, and  practice the steps of the writing process while focusing on a specific text type. Each lesson  provides specific suggestions for supporting English Language Learners. We will use Title III  funds to purchase  Focused Reading Intervention program in grades 1-5 published by Teacher  Created Materials.  In addition, we will use Santillana Spotlight on English; which is a  comprehensive, standards-based program for English Language Learners.  This program  provides the academic language students need to develop proficiency, differentiated reading  instruction, and opportunities for students to practice using Academic English.  This program  provides students will the opportunity to read in a small group, on how to talk, read, and think  purposefully about text.  There is an assessment component to the program that will be used  periodically to assess students' progress in the program.  This intervention program will support  our ELL students in learning the skills and strategies they need to become better readers and  writers. The content teacher will utilize the I-Ready technology program to provide differentiated  instruction based on the levels of language progression.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63      Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             C.S.150 will provide a strong professional development program for all teachers who have direct  contact with ELLs and are part of the Title III after-school program. Our ENL coordinator,  Literacy Coach and ENL teachers will provide professional development on instructional  strategies to support English Language Learners, curriculum supports for ELLs and second  language acquisition theories. Due to our large ELL population, teachers have expressed the  need for training on Engage NY online resources with a focus on the Next Generation Learning  Standards. These trainings will provide teachers with an in depth study on NYS Targets of  Measure (TOMs) and the five levels of progressions to effectively and appropriately instruct  English language learners using knowledge of linguistic demands.  In addition, a selected group of ENL teachers and bilingual teachers will attend a WITsi (Writing  is Thinking through Strategic Inquiry) 101 training, funded by the Title III LEP Program.  This  training will be a 3-day workshop that introduces the overall WIT approach while focusing  deeply on the most foundational material sentence strategies, along with entry points for all  student populations, including ENL, Bilingual and SPED.

Providing ENL classes to  parents will help support parents in their journey to assist and develop proficiency in  English.  There will be 20-25 parents invited to attend our ENL Adult classes. Parents will be  registered on a first come first served basis.  The program will take place at C.S.150 for 10  Parent Tuesdays, from 2:25 pm – 3:35 pm.  The program will begin on December 2018 and end  in February 2019.  Our Parent Coordinator will provide parents with registration forms and  participation information. One NYS certified TESOL teacher will provide instruction for our  ENL Adult class.  This teacher will provide parents with differentiated ENL instruction based on  need.  One key component of the program is to provide parents with survival English classes to  support their communication with the school and community. We will work closely with our  bilingual staff to provide additional translation support to parents.  In return parent  communication will be enhanced and student performance will improve.   Before the Adult ENL classes begin, we will offer parents two workshops to educate them on the  Next Generation Learning Standards and the I-Ready online reading/math program.   In  November 2018 parents will participate in a workshop with an overview on the Next Generation  Learning Standards and how it impacts English Language Learners.  The second workshop will  be held in December 2018 in the technology lab to provide parents with an opportunity to learn  about the I-Ready online Reading/Math program, as well as other educational websites they can  access at home.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

For grades K-5, DRA 2 in English and Spanish is used to assess literacy skills. The lower grade Bilingual teachers use the  Estrellita Program to support native language.  The teachers in grades 3-5 use the Yabisi Program also to support native  language.  The ESOL teachers use the Spotlight on English reading Assessment Kit to assess ELL students in the four skill strands  of Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing. The result that the ESOL teachers gather from this assessment is used to guide  their instruction and identify students strengths and weaknesses. This school year in order to support our ELLs in literacy, we  will work with the Common Core Learning Standards in literacy and the NYSESLAT targets of measure for grades K-5. We will       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69      modify writing tasks that are aligned to the CCLS to support our ELL students within the ranges of language progressions. We  will include opportunities for students to engage in language rich activities that will enable them to develop reading and  writing skills.  In order to ensure that instruction is informed by data, our DRA2 data identifies ELLs as a subgroup. This data is  used in developing small group instruction for ELLs and pull-out and push-in programs.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   At CS 150 we have established a cohort of teachers in grades K-5 to create curriculum maps that are aligned to the Common  Core Learning Standards in order to address the needs of our English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities.  The  team meets twice a month to review and modify lessons in all of the content areas.  Teachers administer the DRA 2 three  times throughout the year and develop action plans with goals and instructional next steps.  Teachers also use the  NYSESLAT data to design instruction according to levels of progression.  ENL teachers use the Spotlight reading assessment to  further analyze performance trends for listening, speaking, reading, and writing.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Through out the school year, we review on a quarterly basis our ELL subgroup through our literacy data base system.  Identifying students who are at risk for academic intervention services is an essential component to the success of our  program. At the end and beginning of each school year, we analyze student performance across the grades. At this point, we  identify areas of strength and areas that need improvement. We continue instructional practices that have proven to be  successful in the past. We also analyze our areas of challenge and collaboratively identify a new strategy to implement and  improve student performance. The two ESOL certified teachers each use Spotlight on English assessment, in order to assess  students in the four modalities: Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing.We have identified all ELLs in monolingual  classrooms and placed them in one classroom where the ESOL certified teachers push in throughout the week and provide  differentiated and small group instruction. Tier II program instruction is monitored and used to adjust program materials,  lessons, and strategies.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Principal and Assistant Principals meet with teachers after administering summative assessments to determine instructional  next steps. During these data dialogs teachers create class goals and individual student goals based on student performance.  Action plans are revised and lesson plans developed to meet the needs of English Language Learners at all levels of proficiency.  The Title III LEP and Title III Immigrant Programs are used to provide instructional interventions. Students are selected based  on the NYSESLAT levels of proficiency. The R-BERN specialist works with our ENL Inquiry team to select students who would  benefit from instructional intervention in reading and writing for the Title III LEP Program and listening and speaking for the  Title III Immigrant Program.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    Data is used from a variety of assessments mentioned above to develop instruction that is meaningful and target the specific  needs of our ELLs.  Bilingual Classroom teachers and ESOL teachers provide Tier 1 RTI instruction to meet the needs of the ELL  population they service. They provide differentiated instruction using the scaffolded strategies handbook for the ReadyGen  Reading program. Tier 2 and Tier 3 instruction is provided during small group instruction to ELL students using Go Math  instructional materials and ReadyGen's flexible grouping component. In addition students that are identified for Tier 2 and 3  instruction are invited to attend our Title III after school program that provide academic support in literacy via Spotlight on  English Program. This program provides us with guided reading materials and oral language development lessons that are  aligned to the common core learning standards.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70         Overall the NYSESLAT proficiency results analysis indicates that 28% our students scored at the entering and emerging levels,  22% at the transitioning level, 43% at the expanding level, and 7% at the commanding level.    When examining the proficiency  levels, the data shows that most students are at the expanding level followed by entering and emerging at 28%.     When comparing 2017 NYSESLAT proficiency levels and 2017 NYS ELA performance levels there are 31 ELLs that scored a level  1, of these students 1 is at Entering, 11 at Emerging, 8 at Transitioning, and 11 at Expanding.  At level 2 there are 24 ELLs in  ELA, there is 1 at Transitioning, 18 at Expanding and 5 at Commanding.  At level 3 there are 6 ELLs in ELA, there are 4 in  Expanding, and 2 in Commanding.  There are no former or current ELLs at level 4.      When comparing 2017 NYSESLAT proficiency levels and 2017 NYS Math performance levels, there are 43 ELLs at level 1, of  these students 8 are at Entering, 15 at Emerging, 5 at Transitioning, 14 at Expanding and 1 at Commanding.  At level 2 in  Math there are 26 ELLs, 2 at Entering, 2 at Emerging, 4 at Transitioning, 16 at Expanding and 2 at Commanding.  At level 3 in  Math there are 9 ELLs, 2 at Transitioning, 4 in Expanding, and 3 in Commanding.  At a level 4 in Math there are 3 ELLs, 1 at  Expanding and 2 at the Commanding proficiency level.    The data collected for different subgroups shows the following: In NYS ELA Students with Disabilities that are ELLs performed  85% at level 1 and 15% at level 2.  There are currently 4 Long Term ELLs and 75% performed at a level 1 in ELA, and 25%  performed at a level 2.     The 4 students that preformed at a level 3 in the 2017 NYS ELA assessment and Expanding on the NYSESLAT will be moved  over to Commanding.  There new proficiency level will change their programming of ENL/ELA minutes from 180 minutes to 90  minutes.  Students with disabilities in the Entering and Emerging levels will be serviced with 180 minutes of  integrated  ENL/ELA and 180 of Stand Alone ENL.  Long Term ELLs will be provided with additional intervention services via our  Title III after school program.  Providing an academically rigorous program to support proficiency in second language  acquisition.             7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   During the beginning of the year the ENL teachers and Bilingual teachers meet with administration and R-BERN specialist to  disseminate NYSESLAT data. ELL student data is analyzed vertically and areas of strength / challenge are identified by  grade.  ENL teachers use EDAT to adjust program scope and sequence for grades K-5.  During ENL / Bilingual Professional  Learning Community meetings teachers and staff developers use findings to group students based on instructional needs.  Embedded into the professional development plan there is time allotted on a monthly basis for rounds of data analysis with a  vertical ENL inquiry team.  During this time, teachers use a protocol for analyzing student work and identifying students in  need of academic intervention.  The findings will also be used to make program adjustments to meet CR Part 154-2 mandates.  In addition, teachers will adjust ENL units based on student data and provide appropriate programming.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71         At P.S. 150X, one-quarter of our K - 5 student population is comprised of English Language Learners, and a large  majority of these students are native Spanish speakers. Approximately half of our ELL students are part of our  Freestanding ENL Program.  They receive instruction through an Integrated and Stand Alone model. The  program follows the guidelines provided by Part 154 of the Commissioner’s Regulations and the New York City  Chancellor’s Recommendations for ELLs, ensuring that all ELLs receive their mandated 360 / 180 / 90 minutes of  ENL/ELA instruction (and HLA where necessary). (See question #2 for more a more detailed description of the CR Part  154 breakdown.)  Our ENL program serves ELLs in monolingual English classes. These students' parents/guardians  have opted them out of the bilingual program. That includes a few students who speak a language other than English  or Spanish, after their parents turn down the option, if available, to place their child in an appropriate bilingual  program in another NYC public school. Grouping for ESOL instruction is homogeneous, based on level of English  proficiency.  As per the CR Part 154 the ESOL teacher will co-teach with a content area teacher to provide students  with the appropriate integrated mandated minutes of ENL. ESOL teachers will use the five levels of progression to  group students and provide students with their stand alone ENL units. We also use iPads in many classrooms for small  group instruction, that provide ELLs with tutorial sessions in ENL. Teachers have a schedule to ensure that students  use the iPads daily.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     At P.S. 150X, we have one Spanish Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) class in grades K, 3, 4, and 5 with one bridge  class in grades 1 and 2.  Approximately half of our ELLs are in the TBE program. This program follows the guidelines  provided by Part 154 of the Commissioner’s Regulations and the New York City Chancellor’s Recommendations for  ELLs, ensuring that all ELLs receive their mandated 360 minutes of ENL/ELA instruction (and HLA where necessary).  (See question #2 for more a more detailed description of the CR Part 154 breakdown.)  We also use iPads in the  TBE classrooms for small group instruction, where ELLs in need have applications that provide ELLs with tutorial  sessions in ENL. Teachers have a schedule to ensure that students use the iPads daily.       c.  DL program.  If applicable.       Not applicable        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   We have five Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) classes, one of which is a 1/2 bridge taught by 5 certified ESL/Bilingual  teachers. All bilingual teachers develop their literacy and ENL schedules according to the mandatory number of instructional  units, dictated by CR Part 154, for the various levels of ELL proficiency in their classrooms. The amount of time bilingual  students get ESOL instruction, varies according to proficiency level. Entering and Emerging level ELLs receive 360 minutes of  ENL per week and Transitioning and Expanding level ELLs receive 180 minutes of ENL per week and Commanding level ELLs  receive 90 minutes of ENL per week. ENL teachers use Stars to program mandated minutes for their students to ensure  instructional minutes are provided. There is a converse relationship between the amount of time students are exposed to their  home language and their English proficiency levels. Instruction in Home Language Arts decreases as English proficiency levels  increase; entering and emerging students get the most support and instruction in HLA, transitioning and expanding students a  bit less, and commanding less still. This lessening of home language support leads to the expected transition from Spanish to  English. Our "ELL" students (ELLs in monolingual classrooms) receive the same breakdown of ENL/ELA minutes as those  students in bilingual classes, that is, based on their proficiency level. These students get their instruction from one of our two  certified ESOL teachers, who follow either the Integrated or Stand Alone model. They do not receive any Home Language Arts  instruction, but whenever possible their ESOL or classroom teacher can support their learning with their home language. (Our  greatest ELL population consists of Spanish speakers, and both ESOL teachers, as well as many other teachers in our school,  speak Spanish).            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Based on Cummins' BICS and CALP distinction, we are cognizant of the difficulty ELLs have with the academic English found in  content area studies. Cognitive academic language is quite different than interpersonal language skills, requiring higher order  thinking skills so students are given as much support as possible in the content areas.  In the ESOL program, the content areas  of ELA, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies are taught using English textbooks and leveled readers in monolingual  classrooms.The ESOL teacher collaborates with the content area teacher to provide content area instruction. ELLs use word-to- word translation dictionaries that support them in their learning of academic language. In our Transitional Bilingual program  content areas of mathematics, science and social studies are taught using Spanish textbooks and leveled readers. The  percentage of time using one language or the other depends on each student's proficiency level. The 60/40 model is used with  entering and emerging ELLs, 60% Spanish and 40% English, and somewhat of an inverse equation is used with more advanced  ELLs. In order to make content comprehensible for our ELLs in both monolingual and bilingual classrooms, teachers build on  students' prior knowledge, and use scaffolding techniques to support student learning. Thematic units of study make each  content area subject more meaningful, where students can see the interconnectedness of these different areas of study.  Content area vocabulary is better developed in this way, where students repeatedly focus on the same theme, albeit in  different subject areas. In the bilingual classrooms content area word walls are in both languages, each language color-coded.  In both bilingual and monolingual classrooms LEA charts hang from light.  We use ReadyGen,  and Go Math Programs that are  aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   The Spanish LAB, administered to Spanish speaking ELLs upon entry to the NYC Public School system, is the first native  language evaluation given. In the case of kindergarteners, it assesses the child's verbal skills in their native language. For older  children entering the NYCDOE for the first time, the Spanish LAB provides a snapshot of their native language literacy skills.  The DRA 2 in Spanish is used to evaluate progress in the native language by tracking reading progress and determining  students' strengths and weaknesses periodically throughout the year. These assessments also help to drive instruction for  students in their native language. Students in grades 3-5, in Spanish TBE classes, take the NYC ELE, a Spanish reading test, in  the Spring of each school year and have the option of taking the NYS standardized content area exams in their native language.  Other students in monolingual classes that speak a language other than Spanish have the opportunity to take the test in their  native language, whenever that language edition is available, or as has been done in the past, through an interpreter, when  there is no written form of the test in their language. These translated editions, or those given through an interpreter, are  generally used with beginner ELLs who are recent arrivals in this country and are in the testing grades.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     We have implemented the use of ReadyGen and Go Math CCLS aligned programs in grades K-5.  These programs are being  used in our TBE classrooms.  These programs provide differentiated instruction in literacy and math.  The Go Math program  provides teachers with resources for tier 2 and 3 instruction.  ReadyGen provides teachers with a scaffolded strategies  handbook to support differentiated instruction for ELL students. Our Newcomers in testing grades are transitioned into a  Balanced Literacy approach to reading English within their first year.   In order to build language, newcomers will be provided  instruction using Mondo Educational Publishing's “Let’s Talk About It”. This program allows students to engage in oral  language activities and explore reading and writing skills like making predictions, grammar usage, analytical thinking, and  linking new learning experiences to what is already known. In addition, newcomers in grades K-5 have received iPads. The use  of ESOL applications on the iPads allow students to receive instruction in language vocabulary and reading. Our ELLs with       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           73      disabilities are placed based on their IEP program recommendation. Some are placed in self-contained monolingual special  education classes, and still others in monolingual or bilingual general ed. classes with related services. These students in  monolingual classrooms receive ESOL services from a certified ESOL teacher. This ESOL teacher collaborates with a content  area teacher to provide ENL units through content area with a differentiated approach to learning. Teachers ensure that  students use iPads daily and monitor student progress and assign tasks based on student need. Special Education students in  grades K-5 receive instruction through a pull-out ESL program with a 1:10 teacher-student ratio. Students in grades K-5 use the  Spotlight on English program which includes a word study component that focuses on narrative and informational texts to  develop academic English. ELLs receiving services 4-6 years benefit from being in monolingual and bilingual classes. Those in  bilingual classes receive their ESOL instruction from their classroom teachers that are certified and plan for this time which is  embedded in the school day. Those in monolingual classes receive their ESOL instruction from a certified ESOL teacher via  content area subjects. The ESOL teacher ensures students receive their appropriate amount of ENL instruction. These teachers  also collaborate with the content area teachers in order to support these students academically. Both content teacher and the  ESOL provider meet periodically to discuss lessons to be taught and to review student progress. The ESOL teacher also focuses  her lessons on English Language Arts (ELA) as it relates to the reading and writing strands of the NYSESLAT exam. Some of the  materials used with this sub-group include: Wilson, Fundations, Reading Reform, and MONDO. Our primary goal for our SIFE  students is to identify their areas of strengths and weaknesses and evaluate and place students in the program that best fits  their needs. In aligning resources to students, we are able to maximize academic potential for our SIFE students. SIFE are  invited to participate in our ELL after school programs where the teachers providing instruction are certified in ESOL and  Bilingual education. These students are included in our school-wide data based system for literacy. This allows us to monitor  progress and drive rigorous instruction (through the use of guided reading groups, differentiated tasks, and individualized  action plans). One of the programs that is used to provide instruction in reading and writing, is Mondo's guided reading  program, which is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards.  This allows teachers to provide systematic instruction in  reading and writing that is standard based.  Long term ELLs within the program will receive scaffolded instruction through the  use of the following programs: National Geographic thematic learning literacy program with native language support.  In  addition, the Leveled Literacy Intervention program by Fountas and Pinnell.  This will support Long Term ELLs in meeting the  Common Core Learning Standards.  All Former ELLs will be provided small group instruction with ESOL teachers weekly for .5  units of ENL services to build academic English and support language through the content areas.  Test accommodations will be  provided to all ELLs and Former ELLs during testing throughout the year.  The testing coordinator will provide teachers with a  proctoring list that will details all extended time for all ELLs and Former ELLs.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   P.S.150X has always tried to place our ELL-SWDs in the least restrictive environment, whenever appropriate. In the past, on  most grade levels, students that were eligible for this sort of placement had been placed in bilingual inclusion classes. In recent  years the number of bilingual inclusion classes has decreased due to a decrease in students who are recommended for this  type of placement. For students whose IEPs indicate placement in self-contained bilingual classrooms and none are available,  an alternate placement para is assigned. For those students who are in monolingual self-contained classes, a certified ESOL  teacher provides ENL instruction. Classroom teachers work in conjunction with the ESOL teacher to plan lessons and find the  most effective way to meet the needs of the ELL-SWD. Many teachers who work with special ed. ELLs have attended  professional development sessions offered by DELLS. These workshops deal with a variety of issues, from learning how to  improve instruction for our ELLs with disabilities to learning to distinguish whether ELLs are still developing English proficiency  or have a disability. Special Education teachers collect data periodically based on simulated test and diagnostic reading  assessments to develop small group/individual instruction for students based on academic needs. Throughout the school year,  teachers reassess groups and adjust placement accordingly. These students are provided with academic intervention during  ELL after school programs. Materials include NYSESLAT and Beyond workbooks, Common Core Aligned New York Ready  materials in ELA and Math workbooks. ELL-SWD students have been provided with iPads. The applications chosen provide  students with differentiated instruction in listening, speaking, and reading. Teachers use data to assign independent skill  practice and small group instruction. There are numerous approaches and strategies that teachers of ELL-SWD are using to  increase language acquisition: BICS (Cummins)- Basic Interpersonal Communications Skills: it takes 1-3 years to develop       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           74      interactions. CALP (Cummins)- Cogntive Academic Language Proficiency: It takes 5-10 years to develop, the development is  directly correlated to higher order thinking skills. Language development is connected to explaining, clarifying, generalizing,  and manipulating ideas. Over time, students can apply knowledge learned and demonstrate an understanding of vocabulary. In  addition, in order to sustain programs and resources provided through the ELL summer enrichment program we will continue  implementation of the following for the 2017-2019 school year:  • Mondo Bookshop Reading Program for grades K-5  • Mondo Guided Reading book sets for first grade; Guided Reading small group instruction  Spotlight on English Program  • Language Power and Focus Intervention Kits  • iPads will be used for research, reteach, and guided practice through the use of educational apps.  • Dictionaries and thesaurus will be used to support vocabulary development for ELLs.  • Classroom libraries in Spanish and English will be utilize to support native language and develop English proficiency.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  In our school for many of our ELL (English Language Learners)-SWD (Students with Disabilities), when recommended are placed  in inclusion classes. These classes have two certified teachers, one General Education teacher and one Special Education  teacher. Students in these settings benefit from a lower student to teacher ratio and a diverse student population  (mainstreamed students and students with needs are placed together), it provides students with an optimal learning  environment. There is more opportunity for smaller group activities and much easier for teachers to identity areas of weakness  and target instruction to correct these weaknesses.  All ELL after school and summer grants allowed our school to run after  school programs throughout the school year and a summer enrichment program specifically for this targeted group.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The following is a description of targeted intervention programs provided and materials used to service our general education  monolingual students, ELL students, and Special Education Students at CS150. Due to the large number of ELL students at  CS150 which consists of about ¼ of our population, they are serviced in all AIS services provided in ELA, Mathematics, Science,  and Social Studies. In the TBE program students are provided with AIS in their native language for Mathematics, Science and  Social Studies.  ELA: During the school day, academic intervention services are provided to students through both push-in and pull-out small  group literacy instruction with ESOL teachers or staff developers in grades K-5. The Literacy Coach and Reading Recovery  Teacher provide additional support utilizing a push-in model. Programs used include: Reading Recovery, ReadyGen, Language  Power, Spotlight on English and MONDO. ELL After-school Program: ELL students in grades 1-5 attend an after-school program  from 2:20 pm – 4:20 pm, Wednesdays & Thursdays. The ELL program focuses on developing proficiency in the English  language. Students are grouped according to their proficiency level and small group instruction is provided. AIS Literacy  Intervention: Literacy Intervention Specialist, Literacy Coach and ESOL Teachers provide services in grades K-5 utilizing a pull- out or push-in model. They teach guided reading skills and test sophistication strategies in small groups, working primarily with  Level 1 and 2 students. These providers push-in or pull-out weekly from their assigned classes during the literacy block.  Mathematics: During the school day, students in 3rd, 4th and 5th Grade receive additional support for Math. As well, the  students receive push-in and small group instruction from the Math Staff Developer/Math cluster teacher. Small group  instruction is provided for the identified students. Science: The classroom teacher provides AIS to students through small  group instruction and hands-on inquiry-based lessons that address the different needs of the students. The Science cluster  teacher also works with identified students. Social Studies: Students are taught social studies through in-classroom thematic  units. The students will engage in hands-on activities to learn the social studies concepts appropriate to the grade.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           75      This school year, we continue to have two ESOL teachers. In addition, we will offer an ENL after-school program for grades 1-5  that will service our bilingual students by providing instruction in ELA, language development, and test sophistication for  NYSESLAT.  Also, as part of our 2017 summer school program for ELLs, we are using materials for all content area learning  provided by Summer in the city. These programs are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards.  ESOL Reading Program  (Guided reading books, big books for shared reading, read alouds, audio CDs, phonics intervention kit, and instructional  guides). We are also providing teachers with Learning A-Z licenses to provide CCLS aligned instruction.  Teachers in grades K-5  have been provided with laptops, iPads and smartboards to enhance instruction.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   There are no programs/services for ELLs that have been discontinued this year.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELL students are afforded equal assess to all school programs. All ELL students regardless of level are given applications to all  after school programs and given the opportunity to participate. We also include ELL students in our extended day program  which is based on student need. We provide numerous workshops for parents of ELLs to keep them informed on the latest  programs available for ELL students and the opportunity to have their child partake in programs available at our school. A  variety of methods are used according to the English level of proficiency of the students by incorporating more educational  trips, more literacy integrated into the content areas, as well as the established variety of methods such as TPR, Natural  approach, and Calla. Also incorporated into our plan for meeting individual needs of our students’ proficiency levels are  individualized instruction based on specific language deficits, small group instruction, and extended day focusing on literacy in  both the native language and English for all the content areas but especially reading and math.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Both our ESOL and Bilingual Programs in grades K-5 utilize the following programs and materials:  • ReadyGen Scaffolded Handbook  •Spotlight on English  •Language Power  •i-Ready  •Reading & Writing A-Z (K-5)  • NYSESLAT & Beyond test prep books  • Harcort Science Textbooks (ELL component)  • MONDO ESL Reading Program (Guided reading books, big books for shared reading, read alouds, audio CDs, phonics  intervention kit, and instructional guides)  • Spanish libraries for grades K-5  • Spanish dictionaries  • Ipads/ laptops / smartboards  Home language/Content Area/Language Material include:*Yabisi  *Estrellita  * Classroom libraries in Home language including big books  * Go Math Program  * Core curriculum materials in Science and Social Studies(Harcourt Brace)  * Common Core Aligned New York Ready Test Ready Materials  * Mondo Let's Talk about it (Language Development)  *Measuring Up Science Workbooks by People's Publishing.      Technology will be embedded throughout the day in all programs. ELL students will be provided with ipads and laptops during  small group instruction in all content areas to address speaking, listening, reading, and writing modalities.  I-Ready will be used  during ENL/ELA integrated units of service.  This program will provide students with listening, speaking, and reading tasks at       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           76         their level and will be used to monitor growth throughout the year. Listening centers will be utilized during the literacy block to  develop language skills.  Lessons using the smartboard will be used during all content area learning to engage students in  academically rigorous tasks that promote English language acquisition.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   The transitional bilingual program provides home language support through content area instruction in the student’s home  language. In our Transitional Bilingual program students receive one class of home language arts daily and a minimum of two  bilingual content area subjects.  Materials used within our Transitional Bilingual Program include: Yabisi, Estrellita, ReadyGen  Reading Program, Go Math, Core Curriculum Science/Social Studies, and Classroom Libraries in Home Language. According to  the home language program models, if the teacher speaks the students’ home language and communication in the child’s  home language is required, the ESOL provider should shift to this language and speak to child in their home language.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    At our school we work within two different grade bands. The first is a K-2 band and the second is a 3-5 band. Each band has a  certified ESOL teacher that specializes in Early Childhood/ESOL for the lower grade and an ESOL teacher for upper grades that  specializes in Reading/ESOL. These two teachers work cooperatively in planning differentiated instruction for students in each  band. Grades K-5 will use a co-teahing model that includes a content area and ESOL teacher.  In addition, ESOL teacher will  provide stand alone units to students according to levels of progression to provide mandated minutes.  The Mondo Language  Development program ("Let's Talk About It") will be used to build vocabulary.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Not Applicable     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   During our ELL Summer Programs we invite newly enrolled students to attend and participate in academic activities with a  multicultural approach.  Parents are provided with workshops and ENL adult classes throughout the school year.  Students are  invited to participate in after-school programs that are designed to meet the needs of new immigrant students and ELL  students.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Not Applicable         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not Applicable      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           77         All staff members including assistant principals, teachers, social workers, and para professionals will receive mandated  professional development as per CR Part 154-2.  We will custimize our professional development to provide ELL personnel with  50% that is required of professional learning, as per part 154-2.  In addition, all other staff members will have 20%  of their  professional development time dedicated to learning about mandates and strategies for ELLs. The following are professional  development sessions that will be provided to staff:   * New mandates of CR Part 154-2  * SIOP Model training  * Co-teaching and collaboration methods  * Implementation of new home language arts program  * Scaffolding instruction for ELLs in all content areas  * Developing academic language in the classroom  * How to use the scope and sequence in Science and Social Studies to plan scaffolded instruction for ELLs  * Using manipulatives in the classroom to engage ELLs at different levels of language acquisition  * Developing academic language through content area learning via an interactive tiered word wall   In order to support teachers of ELLs in helping students to become college and career ready we strive to meet the common  core learning standards through standard based instruction.  Teachers in grades K-5 work in professional learning communities  to develop curriculum plans that use various resources and that are CCLS aligned.  This ensures there is coherence across the  grades and tasks are modified for ELLs in all content areas. The units support common core writing helping students to develop  academic writing and supporting ideas with evidence from texts.   Non-pedagogical staff will attend professional development during Monday PDs on the mandates of the CR-Part 154-2 and  translation services for all families. These professional development sessions will be led by the ENL Coordinator and  ESOL teacher.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our parent coordinator provides students with information about all middle schools and provides parents with workshops on  the middle school application process.  These middle schools also visit our 5th grade classrooms to inform students about their  programs and services.  Parent coordinator work with families to fill out middle school applications and offer support when  needed. Fifth grade teachers and social workers at our elementary school will be provided with professional development on  the New CR Part 154 mandates during Mondays professional learning time.  Social workers and teachers will work within a  professional learning team during the Spring to develop strategies in order to assist ELLs as they transition from elementary to  middle school.  This will include parent contacts, newsletters, one to one conferences with parents and parent workshops. In  order to meet the mandates of CR Part 154-2 50% of professional development for all ELL personnel will be related to English  Language Learners and all teachers will receive 15%.  In order to comply with theses requirements teachers will join ELL  professional learning communities, ELL inquiry team, PD provided by DELLS and collaborate with R-BERN specialist to provide  in house training /Fordham University PD offerings for ELLs.  Our ESOL teachers will document all professional development  activities and keep agendas, minutes, and attendance of all in house PDs.  R-BERN specialist and administration will develop  teacher surveys to provide differentiated PD.  Teacher will write a one page summary after attending all out of school PD and  share out with colleagues.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           78            Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our school offers parents annual meetings throughout the school year to discuss goals of the bilingual or ENL program,  language development of the student, proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content  areas.  Teachers provide parents with an overview of Common Core aligned program such as ReadyGen, go math, science and  social studies scope and sequence, Yabisi, Estrellita, and Spotlight on English.  In addition,  teachers of ELLs inform parents of  the levels of progression and where their child is currently within those levels.  They are informed of their child's progress  throughout the year via progress reports that are translated.  Teachers share an action plan with parents that he or she has  developed according to NYSESLAT results. Teachers share next steps to improve child's academic performance.  All meetings  are translated in the parents' home language.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Our school offers parents an orientation workshop in the beginning of the year explaining all programs offered at C.S.  150.  Parents are also invited to "Meet the Teacher Night" where parents are given information about the core curriculum in  all subject areas and assessments.  They are informed of their child's progress throughout the year via progress reports that  are translated.  Teachers share an action plan with parents that he or she has developed according to NYSESLAT results.  Teachers share next steps to improve child's academic performance.  The parent coordinator works with parents of ELLs to  provide extra guidance and help them learn/link with community resources like: The NYC Public Library, academic after school  programs, sports and arts, Literacy Inc., and health organizations such as Bronx Lebonon Hospital.  All activities will be  translated in the parents' home language.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Edwin Irizarry, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           80                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Charles James Fox                                                                              School DBN: 12X150  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Generally our school uses Part 3 of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) to determine the written and  oral language of our parents. It also helps with the translation and oral interpretation needs of our parents. Since  the HLIS form is a part of every first time NYC Public School student registrant, the adult's preferred language  (RAPL) is known immediately. The English Language Learner (ELL) Coordinator and the ENL teachers orally  interview the parents and assesses their preferred language. If the child is transferring from another NYC public  school, and the student's records containing their HLIS haven't yet arrived, then the Adult Preferred Language  Report (RAPL) is informally ascertained immediately by the staff members that handle registration. The RAPL is  then noted on the child's registration materials. All RAPLs are then put into ATS using the UPPG function, at the  same time that other registration information is being entered. In addition to using the Home Language       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           82      Identification Survey, ATS, and emergency cards are used to identify preferred languages to enhance  communication with all families. The languages below were the ones identified in Part III of the Home Language  Identification Survey (HLIS) at our school.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.
