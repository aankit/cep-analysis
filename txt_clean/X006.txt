The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and informed by New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          7     comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement      NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          9        Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Implement at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify   the instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content  standards; provide time for collaboration on the use of) beginning no later than the 2018-19 school year.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.      Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?  PS 6X ~ The West Farms School's Mission Statement reads as follows, ''Our mission is to create leaders of the world by  empowering the whole child through physical, intellectual, emotional, and social growth in a safe, nurturing  environment."        2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, including   a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   PS 6X has partnered with a number of third-party groups to achieve our vision and mission including: Teachers College  Reading and Writing Project at Columbia University to support the school's reading and writing curricula; The New  Teacher Center through Community School District 12, to support the development of new teachers with highly- trained mentors; Fordham University’s NYS/NYC Regional Bilingual Education Resource Network to support Language  and Literacy instruction; and the support of our District Office Instructional Team to support instruction and curricula  alignment to the Common Core Learning Standards.   Teachers College Reading and Writing Project is a researched-based project that provides teachers with the latest and  most rigorous instructional practices and resources. Teachers receive training from Teachers College consultants and  are given multiple opportunities to attend professional development sessions at Teachers College Columbia  University's Calendar Days. The New Teacher Center is a district-wide initiative that specializes in developing mentors  who will provide ongoing, systematic, personalized supports to new teachers. The partnership with Fordham  University’s NYS/NYC Regional Bilingual Education Resource Network has expanded its focus from working with ENL  teachers and ELL strategies to focusing on teacher practices that address the needs of the school’s overall population.  Another goal of the partnership is to build capacity by developing the leadership of teachers within the building  through co-planning and facilitating professional learning sessions and series. The primary goal of the Southern Cross- Consultancy Education Consultant is to support teachers in implementing rigorous math instruction by providing  guidance with utilizing math resources to provide individualized student instruction. Part of this work involves refining  assessments, planning units of study, and prioritizing math lessons according to student needs and the CCLS. The  school has also instituted a number of special initiatives, including the Positive Behaviors Intervention and Supports  (PBIS) program, which has been in place for the last five years, as well as a strong Student Council. The school’s  strengths include building a positive school culture through the PBIS “B.R.I.G.H.T.” expectations - Believer, Respectful,  Intelligent, Goal-Oriented, Honest, Team Player (such as the BRIGHT store, BRIGHT assemblies, and a Book of the  Month predicated on the applicable BRIGHT expectation), Parent Welcome Center, and multiple teacher teams to  promote staff ownership and distributive leadership practices.    The school’s greatest challenges lie in improving student attendance, increasing levels of proficiency in literacy and  math performance, as well as building teacher pedagogy to meet the wide range of students' abilities throughout the  school. PS 6X is also working to strengthen various assessment strategies (including the provision of clear, specific and  targeted feedback to students and teachers), progress monitoring, and resulting adjustment of practices for teachers  and students. This year, there is an emphasis on DTSDE4.4 where teachers and students work together to implement  a program to create a learning environment that is responsive to students' varied needs. Using assessment in  instruction to check for understanding and encouraging students to make their thinking visible is the instructional  focus for achieving our targeted goals.     3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   PS 6X-The West Farms School is an elementary school with approximately 550 students from grades Pre-Kindergarten  through 5. The school population is comprised of 75% Hispanic, 22% Black, 1% White, and 1% Asian students. The  student body includes 9% English language learners and 21% special education students. Boys account for 50% of the  students enrolled and girls account for 50%. Currently there are about 148 students living in temporary housing. The  specific needs of these students include, but are not limited to: counseling to support social and emotional needs,  smaller groups for individualized instruction and caring attention, and English as a new language as well as academic   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          11      intervention services. Students with instability out of school, require a supportive and nurturing environment, which  PS6X provides.      4.  Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over the   past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   During the 2017-18 school year, progress was made in the Strong Family-Community Ties element of the Framework  for Great Schools from 2.76 in 2016-2017 to 3.28 according to the NYC School Quality Guide specifically around  outreach to parents. Over 90% of our families report feeling welcomed to our school and feel that teachers effectively  communicate with them about their child's progress. Over the year, in addition to expanding our efforts to  communicate with parents and families in multiple languages through translated school documents, phone blasts,  emails, flyers and use of social media, we also implemented various strategies to ensure our families had multiple  opportunities to come into our school, volunteer their time and efforts and to interact with our staff as partners in  their children's education. Though we made progress in the area of outreach to parents, we recognize that we need  to make more progress in the area of parental involvement in school. Thus, during the 2018 - 2019 school year, our  key areas of focus will include partnering with parents to assist with students making progress in Mathematics and  Reading. Our approach will center on the provision of parent workshops, educational trips and parent empowerment  initiatives - all in service of increasing parent power and involvement in their children's educational journey, leading to  increased academic performance for our students.    With a continued focus on student learning and achievement, we have decided to keep our focus on the Danielson  Framework for Teaching Rubric Component 3C: Engaging Students in Learning. Our 2018-2019 Instructional Focus  remains: Across all classrooms, we will consistently encourage our students to make their thinking visible so we can  more accurately assess students’ current level of understanding and provide the necessary supports, including  meaningful feedback, to accelerate student achievement. Students will…participate in daily classroom discussions and  share out their thinking.Teachers will…follow the Instructional Expectations in Literacy and Math to embed coherent  structures across the school and use formative assessment strategies such as: checklists, exit slips and Post-It  feedback notes to monitor progress and inform instructional adjustments. Administrators will…monitor student and  adult learning through daily walk throughs, providing support, feedback including Glows and Next Steps as well as  professional learning opportunities around best practices.   We believe that activities and assignments must be differentiated according to student ability and level. Thus,  instructional materials and resources must match the Learning Target for students, as well as help students produce  high student outcomes. Instruction is structured, yet paced for student interest; at the same time, students are  comprehending core subject material and applying their knowledge to tasks and activities.       5.  Identify at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify the   instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content standards;  provide time for collaboration on the use of data) to be implemented in the 2018-19 school year.   We have arranged the Master Schedule so that all staff members are present in the cafeteria for Morning Arrival,  providing an opportunity for students to start their day with positive greetings and friendly reminders about  expectations for learning from adults who know them well. Additionally, we provide time for collaboration on the use  of data - the inquiry work of teacher teams ensures that trends are identified, lessons and units planned and activities  created that allow students’ individual learning styles and preferences to be considered and addressed. The analyzing  of student work reminds teachers of the importance of approaching instructional planning from a perspective of a  question (such as, “What does this student understand?”) in order to effectively adjust instruction so that the student  can understand more after each lesson. The work of Teacher Teams also provides an opportunity for teachers to learn  about each other’s effective and highly-effective instructional practices, building collegiality among the teams and  improving student outcomes for more students than could be accomplished by teachers working in isolation.             2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 12X006   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   529   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Team members also present this  information in a professional learning environment whole school, in grade bands, and/or within grade levels. Some of  the teams charged with this task include:   ● Grade Leader meeting    ● School-Based Development Committee   ● School Local Measures Committee   ● Professional Learning Teams (Grade Level)   ● Instructional Cabinet        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          42         amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          43     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 6 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student  Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the  connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed  to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of  their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and  Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 6 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent-related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community.

The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Based on the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project's assessment of early  literacy skills of English Language Learners (ELLs), we found that data provided for our ELLs  correlated with Listening, Speaking, and Reading scores on the New York State English As A  Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT).  Our newcomers, identified as students with  0 – 3 years in the United States and Students With Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE), along  with ELL students entering Kindergarten may recognize vowels, but have difficulty identifying  their sounds corresponding to English. Consonants with same sounds (examples being ‘c’ and  ‘k’) are not recognized.  Thus, it would be beneficial for our ELLs to receive intense instruction  in letter sounds and print concepts.    As a school, we have noted that our ELLs who have been in the United States and educated in  Pre-kindergarten and Kindergarten show a 50% understanding of alphabet letter identification  and sounds at the beginning of the first grade school year.  The 50% recognition of the alphabet  can be attributed to reading loss over the summer months. Second grade ELL students, educated  in Pre-kindergarten/Kindergarten and first grade, recognize 60% of letters and sounds.  The loss  may be attributed to infrequent summer reading and interrupted education in the native  countries.  However, it has been noted during reading assessment that students apply strategies  learned in first grade for print concepts.   Second grade students educated in the United States  show an approximate 40% retention for high frequency words, but start the school year at least  one (1) level below the previous school year's end-of-year assessment.    In the older elementary grades (3, 4, and 5), loss of reading strategies and skills can be attributed  to infrequent reading during the summer months.  Like their younger counterparts, they start the  school year at least one or two levels below the previous school year's New York State English  Language Arts (ELA) assessment's level of proficiency. Recent data also shows that students are  below grade level in reading in their native language. Current NYSESLAT data shows that  approximately 50% of Grade 4 students are not interpreting spoken information in English  through listening.   'Newcomers' without prior schooling or a lack of cohesive schooling in their  native language are in need of support in core subjects.      The subgroups include boys and girls in the lowest third of their classes; boys and girls who are  newcomers; boys and girls who live in temporary housing; boys and girls who are classified as  Students with Disabilities; and boys and girls who are classified as English Language  Learners.  Grade levels include Kindergarten through 5.  At present, the after-school program will take place twice each week, on Wednesdays from  2:30P.M. - 4:30P.M. starting on October 24, 2018 and finishing on May 9, 2019.   There are a  total of 26 sessions.   Language of instruction will be English.  However, to support student  learning for newcomers and those students who scored 'Entering and Emergent' on the  NYSESLAT, the native language may be used to explain concepts; the teacher will then explain  concepts in English using English as New Language (ENL) strategies and  methodologies.  Students will be grouped for instruction as follows: K/1, 2/3, and 4/5 and by  reading levels within three classrooms and 16 students in each room.  One teacher will be   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          51         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   stationed in each classroom.  Three teachers are to participate in the program.  Two teachers  are  permanently certified in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) instruction  and will be assigned to the K/1 and 4/5 classrooms.. One teacher is permanently certified in  Bilingual instruction and Special Education instruction; she will teach students in Grades 2/3  utilizing strategies that will support student learning in the classroom.  Attendance will be taken during each session and placed in a binder dedicated to the Title III  Program. Program notification in parents' preferred languages will also be placed in this binder.  Types of materials include:     A-Z leveled books for Guided Reading (paper for printing from computer).  Imagine Learning electronic program for listening, reading, and speaking skills.

Three (3) teachers will receive training; these teachers have certification in  TESOL (Instruction) and Bilingual Education/Special Education.   They are Ms. Irasema  Alvarado, Ms. Ana Rodriguez, and Ms. Freiderys Cedeno.  Each teacher will receive ongoing  Professional Development as follows: CSD 12 ELL Liaison Professional Development, UFT  Workshops, Teachers College Workshops, Professional Development in school from a former  Principal who is an R-BERN at Fordham University,   Note that this Professional Development  will support instructional strategies and methodologies that are incorporated in classrooms.  The schedule for staff Professional Development will be devoted to once per month for a period  of one hour to be held during Monday Professional Learning.  The administration will support  the coordination of professional planning and execution of topics.  Staff may be called upon to  implement Professional Development topics. However, a certified TESOL staff member will be  in attendance to work with selected staff.  Please note that Professional Development is provided  to staff at no cost to the program.  Our Professional Development has been strategically planned and designed to positively impact  the progress of our ELL students.  We have incorporated strategies in core subjects to support  learning and student outcomes.  Vocabulary techniques are essential for Tiers 2 and 3, as words  spoken and read by students are essential for content and academic background.  The New  Language Progressions for Learning allow for students to receive strategies and materials that  will support small group and individual tailoring of core subject content.  All of the Professional  Development received by staff and implemented in classrooms will show student growth in  formative assessments.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          52      Part C: Professional Development   Records, including agendas and attendance sheets, will be maintained in a binder throughout the  school year.  Topics to be covered are as follows:  Topic 1: Making Thinking Visible     Rationale: Visible thinking routines guide the ELLs' thought processes and encourage active  processing of the language by engaging students in cooperative group activities. These activities  help ELLs to deepen their thinking and become part of the classroom community.    Date:  October 2017    Time:  2:30P.M. - 3:30 P.M.    Name of Providers:  Ms. Irasema Alvarado, Ms. Laura Dellatte, and support from Ms. Susan K.  Aker    Audience:  Teachers and Paraprofessionals    Topic 2:   Proficiency Levels and what every student is able to do at each level of language  proficiency - Native Language Arts Progressions  Rationale: Proficiency has to do with functional language abilities and at various  levels.?  Teachers and Paraprofessionals will explore 'can do' activities that would benefit ELLs.  Teachers and paraprofessionals will also  have an opportunity to examine the NLAP in order to  develop their understanding of the  linguistic demands use in content specific context and  the developing activities geared to their ELLs language development needs.  Date:  November 2017  Name of Providers: Ms. Irasema Alvarado, Ms. Laura Dellatte, and support from Ms. Susan K.  Aker    Topic 3:  Scaffolding Strategies to Use with All Students  Rationale: Teachers can meet the language needs of their students through scaffolding, taking  into account the language demands of their students in content classrooms.  Scaffolding  strategies break down academic components so that all students can learn and apply concepts  that will align with components used on all grade levels. Teachers and Paraprofessionals will  learn about different scaffolding strategies developed to support  ELLs.    Date: November 2017  Time:  2:30P.M. - 3:30P.M.

NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as  parent orientation during ELL identification process.     rationale       schedule and duration      name of provider    how parents will be notified of these activities   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             PS 6X - The West Farms School believes in a home/school partnership to support the education  of all students. Therefore, parent involvement is integral to maintaining a strong relationship  between the home and the school.  When parents feel welcome at their children's school, they  will be encouraged to learn about educational initiatives and reach out to the school in order to  provide support at home.  Parents will be notified of these activities through telephone, e-mail, monthly calendars, PA  Newsletter, Flyers, and media (an example being Channel 12).  Translation and interpretation of  subject matter are available during every Parent Engagement Activity.  Records, including  agendas, attendance sheets, and invitations in parents' preferred languages will be maintained in  a binder.  For the 2017 - 2018 school year, we have the following 'Shining Bright Like a Lighthouse'  Professional Development topics for parent engagement:  Topic 1:  Attendance Counts- What parents need to know!  Rationale:  When children come to school daily and on time, they become part of a learning  community where their academic and social abilities are met, i.e. through academic intervention  and enrichment.   Children do not fall behind in their school work and can thus move ahead to  the next exciting component in their studies!  Date:  September 2017  Time:  8:30A.M. - 9:30A.M. and 2:30P.M. - 3:30P.M.

Aker  Topic 2:  How to Make Parent/Teacher Conferences Work for Your Child  Rationale:  According to the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA), only one in four  parents are actively involved in their children’s school.  Studies show that when parents are  involved in their children’s education, their children will generally have higher grades and test  scores, better attendance and self-esteem, higher graduation rates, and be more likely to go to  college. One way to be involved in your child’s education is to attend parent teacher conferences.  It is a time for parents and teachers to work together as a team to discuss ways children can be  supported.     Date:   October 2017  Time:  8:30A.M. - 9:30A.M. and 2:30P.M. - 3:30P.M.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  PS 6X - The West Farms School uses the TCRWP to assess the early literacy skills of English Language Learners (ELLs). The  insights that data provides for our ELLs correlate with Listening, Speaking, and Reading scores on the NYSESLAT.  Our  newcomers, identified as students with 0 – 3 years in the United States and SIFE students, along with ELL students entering  Kindergarten may recognize vowels, but have difficulty identifying their sounds corresponding to English.  Consonants with  same sounds (examples being ‘c’ and ‘k’) are not recognized.  Thus, it would be beneficial for our ELLs to receive intense  instruction in letter sounds and print concepts.       As a school, we have noted that our ELLs who have been in the United States and educated in Pre-kindergarten and  Kindergarten show a 50% understanding of alphabet letter identification and sounds at the beginning of the first grade school  year.  The 50% recognition of the alphabet can be attributed to reading loss over the summer months.  Second grade ELL  students, educated in Pre-kindergarten/Kindergarten and first grade recognize 85% of letters and sounds.  Some loss may be   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          60      attributed to infrequent summer reading.  However, it has been noted during reading assessment that students apply  strategies learned in first grade for print concepts.   Second grade students educated in the United States show an  approximate 40% retention for high frequency words, but start the school year at least one (1) level below the previous school  year's end-year assessment.     The data will inform the school’s instructional plan as follows:  • As per CR Part 154, students with Entering, Emerging, Expanding, Transitioning, and Commanding NYSESLAT scores will  receive tailored instruction from the ENL Provider utilizing 180 to 360 minutes.  This will be done through the ‘Push-in’ model.  • Classroom teachers and the ENL Provider will continue to articulate about student data, strategies, and methodologies for  reaching all students.  • Use auditory, visual, and tactile methods to reach students through a research-based program (Fundations).   • Continue to use successful ENL methodologies for listening, processing information, and speaking.  Examples include ‘turn  and talk’; ‘think/pair/share’; and build on student’s prior knowledge.  •  Engage students in small group instruction tailored to their instructional needs.  Examples consist of Teachers College  Reading and Writing Project, Read Alouds, Shared Reading, Guided Reading, and TC Writing components.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   In order to make thinking visible, The West Farms School ~ PS6X integrates questioning and discussion techniques during  instructional time.  For example, students are prompted to respond to a critical thinking question in pairs or triads.  This is  ‘turn and talk.’  The teacher checks for student understanding and then has students share out their ideas using visuals, such  as sentence frames, anchor charts, and pictures that may be labeled with Tier II or III vocabulary.   Students also ‘think, pair,  and share’ in that they will first think critically, then formulate a response individually.  Students then turn to a partner and  share their thoughts.  After speaking to one another, students are encouraged to share out their thinking to the whole class.     Another method of students sharing their visible thinking is to either have the teacher formulate and ask tiered questions,  ranging from lower order to higher order, and then to open-ended questioning.  Students use visuals displayed in their  classroom to support their answers, examples being question starters, anchor charts, graphic organizers, and Word  Walls.  These are known as nonlinguistic representations which support student comprehension, language acquisition, and  proficiency for English as a new language.    Another practice is small groups or cooperative groups where ELLs can practice L2 with their peers in a more personal, lower- risk setting.  Teachers also work with smaller groups that may consist of students who speak English as a first language and  ELLs who speak a native language.  This practice gives ELLs quality time to practice listening, comprehending, and speaking to  L1 peers.    Another example of structures in place at The West Farms School ~ PS6X is honoring the silent period which allows students to  be part of the classroom community while learning their L2 without feeling pressure to speak a language that they are not yet  comfortable speaking. Lessons are clearly structured, and the pacing of the lesson provides students the time needed to  intellectually engage with and reflect upon their learning and to consolidate understanding.    Another structure is the use of scaffolds using the native language. This is done with the use of native language readings,  organizers, pictures, videos, sentence frames, regalia, and a peer that speaks the student’s native language. ELLs exposed to  this structure show increased knowledge of background information that helps them understand the lesson or unit.    To better serve our ELL population, teachers are directed to learn as much as they can about the cultural background of their  students and to use this information to create bridges within the school and the home. This structure helps the students to  feel more accepted and welcomed into their school community.    To further support staff, professional learning is ongoing in order to support teacher practices and strategies in their  classrooms.  Examples are ‘Vocabulary Development,’ ‘Getting to Know Your ENL,’ ‘TOMS,’ and NYSESLAT.  The ENL Team   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          61      articulates with classroom teachers to learn about student progress, student data in the core subjects, and parent support.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of programs for ELLs is determined through the following:    Progress Report and Environmental Survey:     The Progress Report grade is based on student progress (60%), student performance (25%), and school environment (15%).  Scores are based on comparing results from one school to a peer group of up to 40 schools with the most similar student  population and to all schools citywide.  PS 6X - The West Farms School uses ELL data to determine growth in student progress,  especially in ELA and Math.  10% - 15% of the NYC Schools Survey make up the Progress Report grade.  The school community  indicates responses to several key areas, including academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and  respect.  PS 6X - The West Farms School focuses on community perception of programs for ELLs.        Quality Review:    A rating is determined based on effective methods of accelerating student learning.  PS 6X - The West Farms School uses data  to determine the consistency of instructional practices among grade levels for all students, inclusive of ELLs.      Grades 3–8 State Tests and Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP):  Yearly State tests in core academic subjects assess their mastery of the Common Core Learning Standards.   PS 6X - The West  Farms School analyzes students’ test results to help determine which instructional standards to focus on.  The results are then  compared to prior years, and, based on state-determined AYP standards, used to determine if the school has made adequate  progress towards the proficiency goal.      Annual Measurable Achievement Objectives (AMAOs) are measured at the district level to determine accountability for the  performance of ELLs.       NYSESLAT:  A yearly assessment in ELL students' listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills (Grades K - 5) determine how much  progress students have made from one year to another year.  Comparisons in student growth are also determined by  evaluating scores within three (3) years.     Periodic Assessments:  Periodic Assessments predict students' performance on New York State Tests so that teachers can help every student meet or  exceed State Learning Standards.          4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The NYSESLAT is a summative assessment that assesses ELLs’ speaking, listening, reading and writing proficiency levels in  English. The data gathered from the NYSESLAT gives the ENL providers information about the ELLs’ level of language  acquisition.  We are interested in analyzing components that focus on listening, speaking, reading and writing.  We look at  student levels ranging from ‘Entering’ to ‘Commanding.’  We analyze student growth over a three-year period, as well as areas  of concern.  We notice which students are ‘pushables’ and ‘slippables’ in order to create lessons that will address grouping and  differentiation.  The data supports ENL Providers to identify areas of growth and areas in need of support, as well as to  determine the composition of specific ELL groups based on linguistic and academic needs.     The ENL providers use information on students to generate new knowledge on what works and why.  They share their  knowledge with staff, and build their ability to address a greater range of their students’ learning needs. The NYSESLAT helps  teachers adjust their teaching methods to meet the needs of a variety of ELLs.     2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          62         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   PS 6X - The West Farms School reviews student data (inclusive of ELLs) throughout the school year to determine guided  instruction for all students in Grades K - 5.  Student data reveals reading and math levels of mastery; strategies understood and  applied for reading text and showing work for math problems.  Student writing depicts an understanding of using the English  language, as well as applying grammatical concepts.  Teachers use student data to inform instruction through teacher  observation and anecdotals, formative and summative assessments. We analyze student understanding and actual student  work during each phase of the core subjects, examples being noting student progress during units of instruction and at the end  of each unit.  Examples of formative assessments include teacher-based tests, NYSESLAT baseline and midline, journal writing,  Quick Check for Math, and periodic assessments for ELA and Math.  Summative assessments  include NYS ELA, Math, and  Science assessments (Grades 3 - 5: ELA and Math; Grade 4 - Science); NYSESLAT, (K - 5); and TCRWP for primary grades. The  Performance Task is administered to Grades K through 5.       The above data guides instruction for all students, inclusive of ELLs.  By studying students' instructional needs, the school  aligns the Response to Intervention Framework to K - 5 students' second language needs.  The Core of Instruction (Tier 1)  provides instructional support consisting of rigorous and evidence-based curriculum, inclusive of English language  development for ELLs.  This covers 80% of students' needs, inclusive of ELLs.  Tier II, covering 5 - 10% of students (including  ELLs) focuses on teachers providing core instruction from rigorous and evidence-based curriculum, in addition to giving  students extra attention (example: small group or individual tailored instruction) and differentiated activities.  Intensive and  individualized instruction make up Tier III instructional support.  Here, mostly individualized and small group instruction are  carried out for 1 - 5% of students, inclusive of ELLs.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data patterns across proficiency levels on the NYSESLAT show that approximately 30% of our students in Grades K - 5  improved in their speaking, from Emerging to Expanding and Expanding to Commanding.  Traditionally, K - 5 students have  done well in listening (Transitioning and Expanding) and continue to show gains in this area. Grades 3 - 5 students made a 10%  gain in reading and writing on the NYSESLAT.  The NYSESLAT, administered to students in K - 5 who are new to New York City  Schools, continues to show that ELLs need Listening and Speaking strategies to improve their comprehension and language  skills.           7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   ENL Benchmarks; RTI, and Tier Level Interventions         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   a. Push-in Model:  The ENL and classroom teachers work together to provide support, modifications, and  accommodations with lesson planning, activities, assignments, and projects.  Articulation pertaining to student data  enables teachers to differentiate instruction for students.  Teachers are aware that ELL students receive the  mandatory minutes per week according to NYSESLAT scores:  Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning: 360 minutes.  Expanding: 180 minutes.  For former ELLs (ELLs who have received 'Commanding' on the NYSESLAT), regular  consultation between teachers continue.  Instructional support in the core subject is given, along with differentiated   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          63         instruction.  For at least two years, students who are rated 'Commanding' receive 90 minutes per week of ENL/ELA or  another content area.  b. Homogeneous (proficiency level is the same in each class).     c. English as a New Language instruction is required to be offered through two settings: (1) Integrated ENL  methodologies in content area instruction co-taught or individually taught by a dually certified teacher.  d.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   As per CR Part 154, ELLs in the ENL Program who have scored Entering and Emergent receive 360 minutes of  instruction.  Transitioning and Expanding receive 180 minutes of instruction.  Commanding students receive 90 minutes of  instruction.  All listed minutes of instruction are done during the school week by the ENL Provider.  A schedule of students and  their instructional time is on file at PS 6X - The West Farms School and populated in STARS.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Content areas in the English as a New Language (ENL) model are designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading,  writing, and communicating in English through the integration of academic content appropriate for the student's age, grade  level, and English language skills, as per the Common Core Learning Standards.  Instruction is provided in 45 minute  blocks.  The following instructional approaches and methodologies support student learning and meet the demands of the  CCLS in the ENL program model:    - Increase Wait Time:  Students are given time to think and process information.  More processing time allows students to  think about their responses in English.  As students think about processing their responses, they can refer to sentence starters,  anchor charts, and graphic organizers.     - Simplify Teacher Language:  The teacher speaks directly to the student, emphasizing important nouns and verbs.  The teacher  may rephrase questions in order to use words that are understood by the student.  This methodology supports students who  have scored Emerging through Commanding on the NYSESLAT.  Native language cognates can also be used to support  language processing.  The language cognates can be found on classroom Word Walls.  - Think/Pair/Share:  The teacher will ask a group or whole class a question.  Students think about their responses. They pair  with a partner (or two partners), then share information aloud.  This instructional approach is best done while students are  together on the carpet during a Mini Lesson.  A similar approach is Turn and Talk.  Students turn to partners and take turns  sharing their responses.  - Student Communication Other Than Speaking: Students with limited English proficiency can demonstrate comprehension  through body language, drawing pictures, manipulating objects, pointing, and gesturing.     - Visuals/Manipulatives: The teacher demonstrates concepts using visuals and manipulatives.  Teachers can write about these  concepts as words and post them on Word Walls, classroom objects, and the student's personal artifacts, an example being  the student's notebook.  For other core subjects, actual objects/manipulatives can be labeled for reference; as students work  with objects/manipulatives, they can refer to labels to solidify the naming of objectives/manipulatives.  - Teach Lessons as Sensory Activities:  Give students a chance to touch, listen, smell and taste when possible. Talk about the  words that describe these senses as students physically experience lessons. Write new words as well as say them.  - Build on Student's Prior Knowledge:   Through understanding about  the student's prior knowledge or previous way of having  been taught, students can work on assignments through linguistically easier tasks adapted to the language level.  Examples of  making assignments 'language friendly' include assigning materials that encourage the student's communication:  maps,   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          64      pictures, charts, time lines, and photographs.     - Vocabulary Building: PS 6X - The West Farms School has used two initiatives in building vocabulary for all students:  The  Frayer Model, which identifies what a word is about and what it is not about (example:  A dog is an animal; a dog is not a  flower).  The Seven Steps of Vocabulary Development by Margarita Calderon goes through seven steps in teaching  vocabulary:  presenting the vocabulary term, repeating the vocabulary term, contextualizing, defining the vocabulary term;  explaining the vocabulary term; engaging students in using the vocabulary term in a sentence, and then analyzing the  definition.  Included in vocabulary building are words learned which are based on Tier 1 (every day words); Tier 2 (words that  are higher order and used daily in and out of school); and Tier 3 (words that align to academic areas).      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   The Spanish LAB is administered to all new entrants in grades K to 12 whose HLIS responses indicate a home language of  Spanish and who are newly identified as ELLs based on NYSITELL results. It is administered throughout the year as necessary.  The Spanish LAB is administered at the time of initial enrollment during the same testing window as the NYSITELL. The Spanish  LAB is used to support PS 6X - The West Farms School in instructional planning in providing bilingual and ENL services to these  students. Spanish LAB results are not used to determine ELL status or service entitlement.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. Differentiate instruction for SIFE:  Targeted  programs should  be  created which address their  verified  and  documented  needs, provide  challenging, standards based  content, have  explicit exit criteria,  and  prepare  them for eventual transition  into the regular  instructional program.   SIFE should  be  provided  an appropriate  standards based  program using  enriched  instruction  which consistently promotes literacy and  incorporates social-emotional  learning  and  cultural  awareness.  Content areas in the English as a second language model should be designed to develop  skills in listening, speaking, reading, writing, and using language that covers vocabulary in Tiers 2 and 3.  Students should have  opportunities to participate in small groups and confer frequently with the teacher.    b. Differentiate instruction for Newcomers:  Explicit instruction in word reading skills; Content based literacy approach;  Instruction in academic language; building on phonemic and phonetic instruction; reading comprehension instruction;  Intensive instruction in writing for academic purposes; Effective assessment system to inform instruction.  An example of a  teaching methodology is giving students a chance to touch, listen, smell, and taste when possible.  Talk about the words that  describe their senses.  Write new words, as well as say them.  Use Word Walls for Tiers 2 and 3 vocabulary.    c.  Instructional Plan for ELLs receiving 4 to 6 years:  Distinguish important from incidental information; Explicitly discussing  relationships among pieces of information; Structuring or organizing information to provide clarity; Transforming abstract  content into concrete forms; Tying new information to prior knowledge.  Through understanding about the student's prior  knowledge or previous way of having been taught, students can work on assignments through linguistically easier tasks  adapted to their language level.   d. Instructional Plan for Long-term English Language Learners (completed 6+ years):  Use curriculum, instruction, and  strategies/scaffolding (examples being small grouping and individual support; coaching, and modeling. Use resources that  promote transfer between English and the home language, especially the use of cognates.  Enriched oral language  development; emphasize oral language throughout the curriculum. Modified instructional strategies and supplemental  materials provide access to academic content.   Provide students with exposure to high-quality literature and expressive  language.  e.  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status:  A half unit of ENL  services that monitor and support the student’s  language development and academic progress.     - Explicit Instruction: The conversation is teacher-led, while students listen.  The teacher explains what the strategy is (that is,  its name and its definition), why it is important, and when the strategy can be used.   - Teacher Modeling/Thinking Aloud:  The teacher shares an example of what the strategy looks like in actual operation. The  teacher does this using a common text that is visible to everyone: big book, transparency, shared little books. Teacher   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          65      modeling takes place within the whole group or within the small groups during small-group reading. Thinking aloud is an  important part of modeling, as it makes one’s thinking audible. A think-aloud is a demonstration of thought processes: the  person says what he or she is thinking as he or she performs a task. During the think aloud, the teacher also emphasizes key  words that ELLs will need to remember and use, or provides additional background knowledge. The teacher models with a  small text sample, then asks students to do the same with the following sentence or two.   - Collaborative Use of the Strategy. The teacher invites students to contribute their questions and observations to the  modeling. The teacher guides them carefully through questions and comments that lead readers to effective use of the  strategy. Teachers should encourage students to think aloud and share their use of the strategy. It is most important that ELLs  also practice this strategy right away with a peer while the teacher listens or asks for students to share examples.   - Guided Practice. With this step, the teacher begins to release the responsibility for using the strategy to the students. The  teacher supports students as they begin to use the strategy. He or she monitors and evaluates students’ level of proficiency,  determining when they seem ready to move on to doing this on their own with a new segment of text or new text. The teacher  may set students to read independently or in pairs (small groups at the beginning of the year for newcomers may be  overbearing), and then listens in while they read and use the strategy and the pre-taught vocabulary for that strategy.  Teachers might also ask readers to write down their questions or other indications of strategy use and then review them to  monitor their use of the strategy.   - Independent Use of a Strategy:  Independent use of a strategy will occur in independent core subject settings.   The teacher  uses the whole group to teach, model, and guide practice of the strategy. Teachers then give students encouragement through  important tips, questions, and reminders, which help them effectively apply the new skills and strategies.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   An IEP team determines a student’s eligibility for special education services and the language in which special education  programs and services are delivered. ELLs who are also students with disabilities (SWD) receive accommodations that apply  both to ELLs and SWDs, as appropriate. ELLs with disabilities are not exempted from the NYSESLAT, and may use the test  modifications and accommodations as detailed on their IEP when taking the NYSESLAT (and as permitted in the School  Administrator’s Manual for the test). ELL status cannot be the determinant factor for special education eligibility. Response to  Intervention (RTI) approaches should be applied to ELL students who enter with lower levels of proficiency in the home  language, or if anticipated progress is not noted after a reasonable time period.   The procedures for conducting bilingual assessments of ELLs who currently have IEPs or may have IEPs developed as a result of  an initial evaluation.  ELLs with disabilities must receive the required level of ELL services, although program placement and  parental option procedures may be different for special education programs and services, and are facilitated by the Committee  for Special Education during IEP meetings.      Instructional strategies and grade-level materials provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language  development. Instructional strategies include integrating ENL strategies within all instruction, as well as components within the  Workshop Model; teach the introduction explicitly and implicitly and model or demonstrate how it is done; have students  work in small groups and independently, have students listen ('turn and talk'; 'think/pair/share') and share out knowledge  within groups and to the whole class; have students practice how to listen carefully to information and engage in note taking  or responding to a prompt.  For Math, have students use manipulatives to deepen understanding of concrete items and bring  this to an abstract level.  Grade level materials include Imagine Learning English, Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT and Beyond  (Attanasio); FINISH LINE: NEW YORK ELLS;  SMART Board, listening centers, and visual materials. Technology includes Imagine  Learning English, Starfall, Reflex Math, and i-READY..  Grade level materials provide students with skills, strategies for learning,  as well as inquiry based, hands-on exploration to obtain deeper information about components being taught.          7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  All students are required to have equitable instruction in curricula implemented in classrooms. In describing the components  below, it is important to note that flexible programming is used to maximize time spent with students, in order that they   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          66      receive their mandated minutes of ENL instruction within their regularly scheduled instructional time. PS 6X - The West Farms  School utilizes the Department of Education Scopes and Sequences in all core areas. Curriculum maps, along with pacing  schedules are issued to pedagogues. The Workshop Model is utilized throughout the day and is incorporated in a Flow of the  Day Chart posted in each classroom.     A. Programming and Scheduling Information  Homeroom and Cluster teachers articulate with the ENL Provider. ENL Provider pushes into classrooms to team teach and to  provide ENL strategies and methodologies. Other methodologies include cooperative learning and small grouping, instructional  modifications, vocabulary development, and the incorporation of Q-TEL strategies.  To facilitate articulation, curriculum planning and the sharing of methods and strategies that support  scaffolding across content areas; common preparation periods are arranged once a week for teachers in  the same grade (all 1st graders, all 5th graders, and so on). Furthermore, ENL strategies are infused into  content instruction by classroom teachers using adaptations of materials (use of pictures and illustrations, use of tape recorder  for listening/speaking/reading activities, modification of L2 vocabulary); directions (Simplify and illustrate them); instructional  presentation (scaffolding concepts, individualized tasks, the use of oral modeling),  motivation (prior knowledge student’s own culture, student participation). Also included are the ELMO and the SMART Board  for explicit, engaging instruction. As part of effective instruction, assessments are administered to students and studied by all  staff. Examples are Running Records and unit tests in core subjects.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted Intervention Programs for all students, including English Language Learners are conducted in English.     -English Language Arts (Reading, Writing, Speaking):  Teachers College Reading and Writing featuring explicit instruction and  Independent Reading to increase stamina and fluency.   Use of Word Wall to enhance Tier II vocabulary, as well as sentence  stems.  -Mathematics: GO Math (Use of mathematics models an example being the Bar Model; manipulatives, academic vocabulary,  and Word Wall.)     -Science, Social Studies:  FOSS Science and DOE Social Studies Scope and Sequence; academic vocabulary, hands-on inquiry,  and written assignments.  -Team Teaching: Classroom Teacher and ENL Teacher working with whole class, small groups, and individual students  depending on academic need derived from student data.     -Progress Monitoring in core subjects.  To make use of RTI interventions to note students' understanding of English Language:  1. Use tools with demonstrated reliability and validity to identify and monitor students’ need for instructional support in  reading in both L1 and L2. 2. Assess students’ language skills in L1 and L2 to provide an appropriate context regarding  evaluation of current levels of performance. RTI for English Language Learners: Appropriately Using Screening and 11 Progress  Monitoring Tools to Improve Instructional Outcomes 3. Evaluate the potential effect of the process of L1 and L2 acquisition on  current performance. 4. Plan instruction based on what is known about the student’s current level of performance and his or  her literacy experiences in L1 and L2.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Teachers College Reading and Writing; updated GO Math      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   The Ready Gen program for Literacy and ELA is discontinued.  The supports in this program do not afford ELLs the capability to  use speaking skills, writing skills, and reading skills.  Teachers supplement other materials (example: starfall.com) to fill this  gap.                 2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          67      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  English Language Learners are afforded equal access to all school programs according to thePS 6X - The West Farms School's  School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP).  Classroom teachers teach grade-level curricula to all students with  differentiated instruction according to students' ability to understand curricula.  Teachers on each grade level follow a pacing  schedule to ensure that academic content is carried out according to scheduled dates. The ENL Teacher works with classroom  teachers to assess students in order to comprehend how well they understand curricula.  Parent workshops, parent/teacher  conferences, and home/school communication inform families of the curricula that is being taught and how curricula is aligned  to the Common Core Standards.   Tuesdays are designated for teachers to prepare information for families that will enhance  their knowledge of curricula, as well as how to support their children in reading, writing, speaking, and listening.   ELLs  participate in an after-school program that highlights reading, writing, listening, and speaking through ELA, Mathematics, and  Science.  ELLs engage in using technology (Imagine Learning, Starfall, Reflex Math, and i-Ready) to improve reading and writing  skills.           12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials that support ELLs are Imagine English, Starfall, i-Ready, Reflex Math,  Word Walls, Math manipulatives,  and hands-on Science materials.  Graphic organizers support ELL organization for core subjects. Listening centers support  hearing stories in English.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is delivered in the ENL Program.  Students read for at least 1/2 hour each day to family  members.  Students engage in completing homework and other assignments, an example being interviewing a family member  about his/her childhood in the native country.  Students with computers at home can access Max Scholar and other  instructional websites that enhance reading, writing, speaking, and hearing. Instructional materials that support ELLs are  Imagine English, Max Scholar, Starfall, Word Walls, Math manipulatives, and hands-on Science materials.  Graphic organizers  support ELL organization for core subjects.  Listening centers support hearing stories in English.  Academic Intervention  Services are offered for ELLs who need extra support in Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking.           14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The school aligns core subject curricula to the Common Core Standards and DOE Scopes and Sequences.  Each grade level  covers specific requirements that are taught to students.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Instructional materials that support ELLs are Imagine English, Starfall, i-Ready, Reflex Math, Word Walls, Math manipulatives,  and hands-on Science materials.  Graphic organizers support ELL organization for core subjects. Listening centers support  hearing stories in English.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELLs are included in an ENL program in Summer School for the purpose of improvement in Reading, Writing,  Speaking, and Listening.  A licensed pedagogue works with students on Independent and Guided Reading; having students  engage in narrative, informative, and other non-fiction writing (according to the CCLS).  Students also have opportunities to  engage in Mathematics problem solving (using Tiers 2 and 3 vocabulary).  Students show their complete Mathematics work on  paper and then make their thinking visible to classmates.  School counselors, teachers, and Parent Coordinators speak to  families about their child's progress.   K - 1 Parent/Child English classes is sponsored by the Division of Family and Community  Engagement.  Grades  2 - 5: Title III Summer School Program and Summer in the City.          2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          68         The ENL Academy supports ELLs with reading, writing, speaking, and listening, all taught by licensed pedagogues.  The ENL  Science Academy offers vocabulary development through a number of hands-on inquiry activities and read-alouds.  Students  make their thinking visible through questioning and discussion techniques. The use of the SMART Board is integrated, along  with live videos that depict the subject matter instructed.         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    PS 6X - The West Farms School offers language electives that offer students opportunities to read, speak, and write.  An  example is Student Council and activities associated with the council; Career Day; Earth Day; Sparkle and Shine Formal Dance;  Winter Arts Family Festival; the Vermont Farm Trip; Literacy Paint Night; Three Kings' Celebration; Spirit Day; Hispanic Heritage  Month; Bullying Awareness     The following language electives are offered to ELLs during the school day:  Movement, Yoga and Physical Education.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Paste response to question here:        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The Professional Development plan for all ENL personnel, inclusive of all teachers of ELLs, is varied.  The Principal, Assistant  Principals, teachers, including teachers of ELLs and SWDs, Paraprofessionals, the Guidance Counselor, Social Worker, Bilingual  Psychologist and Psychologist, Paraprofessionals, and support staff have opportunities to receive Professional Development.     Ms. Yolanda Barker, Director of Renewal Schools at District 12,  provides Math Support at PS 6X - The West Farms School.  She  visits all grade levels to inform best teaching practices for the Go Math! program (including students who are ELLs and SWDs),  align curricula with the Mathematics Common Core Standards, and conduct classroom visitations to support teacher  instruction and practice for all students.  Ms. Jessica Greiss and Ms. LaKeisha Howell, Staff Developers from Teachers College  visit all grade levels to inform best teaching practices (inclusive of ELLs and SWDs) in Reading and Writing (Guided, Shared,  Independent Reading, Partner Reading; Writing Process).  They visit classrooms to support teachers with research-based  strategies that help students further their knowledge in using language skills.  Thus, Ms. Barker, Ms. Greiss, and Ms. Howell  model and scaffold best practices for all ENL personnel, inclusive of all teachers of ELLs.  Ms. Elsie Cardona -  Berardinelli provides staff with support for instruction for ENL students.  CSD 12 Liaison Meetings for ENL Coordinators focus  on instruction, LAB-R, ATS, and other topics pertinent to ENL students and staff.     Staff have opportunities to attend workshops at Teachers College and turn-key to colleagues during Monday and Tuesday PD  and Chancellor's Conference Days.  The UFT Teacher Center, Assistant Principal's Conference, and CSA offer workshops that  address academic practices aligned with the CCLS, focusing on best practices for integrating language and content insturction  for all students, including ELLs and SWDs.         PS 6X - The West Farms School is culturally responsive to its student and parent populations.  Thus, to celebrate Hispanic   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          69      Heritage Month, we had an assembly program related to dance and teachers conducted read-alouds for students focusing on  Spanish culture and life and other read-alouds written by Latino/Latina authors.     A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 80  must be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating  language and content instruction for English language learners. For all bilingual and English as a new language teachers, a  minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required professional development hours must be dedicated to language acquisition in  alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating  language and content instruction for English language learners.      PD dates include 10/5 (Writing as per Teachers College), 10/26 (Overview of CR-154), 10/7, 10/14, 10/28 (Teachers College  Staff Developer visit for lower grades); 11/2, 11/16/ 11/30 for Teachers College Staff Developer - upper grades; 11/3  (Chancellor's Conference Day: HLAP and NLAP; Guided Reading, Shared Reading; 10/17 (Assistant Principal Conference -  Bilingual Language Progressions, CR-154, and Blueprint for ELLs); 11/7 (Applying ENL Strategies In The Intergrated Classroom  sponsored by UFT Teacher's Center); and 11/14 (CSA Blueprint for ELLs).  Math visitations: 10/6, 10/13, 10/20).  Parent  Coordinators and Parent Association attend monthly meetings at the District Office where ELL needs are addressed.     Our consultant from Fordham University visits our ENL and AIS Providers and offers the following Professional  Development:  CR-154, using HLAP and NLAP to support planning and instruction for students, including ELLs and SWDs,  Blueprint for ELLs, scaffolds for teachers to support student learning, NYS assessment data to support ELLs, NYSESLAT, data  from ATS to note those modalities that are areas of focus (listening, speaking, reading, and writing); vocabulary enrichment  (Frayer Model); and professional literature to stay current.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The Guidance Counselor;  the SAPIS Counselor, and the Parent Coordinator mentor and advise staff with the tools to ensure  that students have a smooth transition from PS 6X - The West Farms School to middle school.  The three individuals work with  staff to implement a time line  to support handing in documents in a timely manner.  Teachers take the time to communicate  the time line to students and their families.  All families are welcome to our school to work with staff on documents.  For  example,  the Guidance Counselor speaks to parents by appointment or through ‘walk in’ encounters to answer questions and  to support parent documentation on forms.  Parents and students are spoken to in English and in the native  language.  Applications and other written documentation are provided in English and in the native language.  As needed,  telephone calls serving as reminders for handing in documentation are made in English or in the native language.  Written  reminders in English and the native language are handed out to parents.      The Guidance Counselor, SAPIS Counselor, and Parent Coordinator invite local staff from Middle Schools to speak to students  in small settings.  Translation is provided for those ELLs who better process information in the preferred language.       Families are encouraged to research middle schools on-line in the preferred language.  Staff will help families locate particular  middle schools that are of interest.  Lastly, staff distributes brochures, the DOE Middle School Information Book, and other  information to families concerning important facts about middle schools.   A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 80  must be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating  language and content instruction for English language learners. For the ENL teacher, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the  required professional development hours must be dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area  instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for  ELLs.   Examples can include DOE professional development, workshops sponsored by UFT Teacher Center, and on-line   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          70         professional development.

Examples of PD activities include ELL Blueprint and CCLS aligned with NLAP.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   PS 6X - The West Farms School believes in a home/school partnership to support the education of all students. Therefore,  parent involvement is integral to maintaining a strong relationship between the home and the school.  A staff member who  speaks the native language serves as the translator and interpreter for parents.  - The Parent Coordinator holds monthly Parent meetings in which parents receive information that is integral to their child's  education.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Tiawana Perez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          73                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Public School 6                                                                              School DBN: #INGES  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      When newly admitted students and their families are registered at PS 6X, they are given a Home Language  Information Survey (HLIS) to read and to complete. Once the HLIS has identified the Home Language as a language  other than English, the NYSITELL assessment is administered. It is from these documents that families are  identified as speakers of a language other than English. Our certified pedagogues, fluent in English, Spanish,  Bengali, and African dialects interview families to determine their comprehension of questions listed on these  documents. According to Chancellor's Regulation A-663, PS 6X determines within 30 days of a student's  enrollment the primary language spoken by the parent of each student enrolled at PS 6X, and if such language is  not English, whether the parent requires language assistance in order to communicate effectively with school  staff. PS 6X maintains an appropriate and current record of the primary language of each parent in ATS and on the  student's emergency card.    2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          75         ATS reports used to assess language preferences of the parent community include RLAT, a compendium of  information pertaining to the NYSESLAT scores in Reading, Writing, Speaking, and Listening. We also refer to RCPL  report which shows the parent's preferred language for oral and written communication.       Student emergency contact cards convey family information, including names of adults who can be contacted in  the event the parent cannot be reached. Families who need support in completing the emergency contact card  can do so at school; our Parent Coordinator and other staff who speak the native language are available to  support families. Surveys and other informational sources conducted in English and the native language are  available for oral or written purposes. The Parent Coordinator and other staff are available for translation and  other support, an example being answering questions that need clarification. An example of a survey is finding out  what parents want to learn during the school year in order to support their children.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.
