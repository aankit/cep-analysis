This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?     PS 396’s learning environment is flexible and responsive to the diverse needs of the “whole child” including social,  emotional, and academic. Ongoing collaboration and mutual accountability maintains high expectations for the  teaching and learning of all students and their continuously improving outcomes. Exemplary, cohesive instruction  based on innovative thinking and student ownership enables each child to be productive and successful members of  the community.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Contextual Information:    ● P.S. 396 is an elementary school with 300 students from pre-kindergarten through grade 5. The school population  comprises 18% Black, 80% Hispanic, and 2% White students. The student body includes 20% English language learners  and 30% special education students. Boys account for 55% of the students enrolled and girls account for 45%. The  average attendance rate for the school year 2017-2018 was 93.4%.   ● We are a school with a NEST program, ICT classes that supports both general education students and high  functioning students on the autism spectrum towards meeting general education standards.   ● We are a Bronx Arts Learning Community school which incorporates music, dance, theater, and visual arts into our  curriculum with in-school arts certified teachers and through partnerships with CBOs to provide all grades with a 10- 20 week arts residency throughout the year.    ● We have an after school enrichment program that offers 3 cycles over the year of various sports and arts programs  including: the school garden (through a partnership with Grow NYC), a co-ed sports club, Musical Theater Club (annual  musical production), arts and crafts, STEM, healthy living, movie & book club, art, and computers.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Special Student Populations:   ● Special Education NEST students- all students entering our program are carefully screened and while require social  and behavioral supports through speech, OT, PT, and in-class behavioral supports they are of average or above  average IQ.   ● Special Education SETSS students- our students who participate in our SETSS programs work with special education  providers to receive additional academic support in either literacy, mathematics or both to meet grade level  standards.    ● English Language Learners- our ELL students range from new arrivals to multi-year ELLs. We have designed our  program as a full co-teaching model whereby students are not removed from their classroom but rather general  education and ELL teachers co-plan and implement grade level appropriate lessons with multiple entry points  allowing for both accessibility and differentiation for all students.    ● Student in Temporary Housing- many of our students (and their parents) require additional emotional and social  support in order to be successful which is supported through our full-time guidance, social worker, and school-based  Morris Heights Clinic.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Framework for Great Schools   Areas of Celebration:      1.3 You have made a number of strategic decisions to scaffold the school’s instructional goals. The adaptation of PBIS  and RULER has been one such decision. It was evident during our walkthrough and the assembly I attended during  you’re District Charter Collaboration visit, that the implications for improving the socio-emotional needs of your  school community is a priority and is having impact on all learners. Collaborating with teachers and students to  improve school culture has the potential for helping practice evolve in a myriad of ways. This work is a catalyst for  further inquiry.   2.2 Ensuring that the array of assessments you use are aligned to the CCLS and curricula to garner data on key student  understandings is a strength of practice under your leadership. This is complimented by teacher data tracking, both  classroom and and even students who track their own data as a means of self-assessment. Collaboratively, you have  been able to assess how specific strategies impact on questioning in the classroom. It has provided another lens with  which to evaluate classroom assessments and support elevated teacher practice which can be evaluated via the  Danielson Framework for Teacher.   3.1 The shared leadership model which flourishes under your guidance establishes a congruent vision of school  improvement which is data and goal driven. The goals are not limited to school and teacher but are invested in  students. This process is evolving thus cultivating more robust and rigorous goals that are learning objective aligned  and becomes a mission that is school created. Your method of identifying focused goals is a great foundation for  school improvement. It also provides coherence across content areas and grades with opportunities for better data  harvesting which would yield support objectives and greater student intervention impact.    5.1 Your school has a process to regularly monitor and adjust decisions affecting the instructional core. The school’s  instructional cabinet has created systems to review policies in relation to their use of resources, effectiveness of  teacher feedback, and quality of teacher teamwork. This was evident in the constant review of the data that was  present during our discussion such as the curriculum refinements, and professional learning cycle’s calendar aligned  to student and teacher data/feedback. There were also elements of intervisitations to see best practices and the  ability to provide nonrated feedback to each other. Professional cycles of learning were differentiated based on  surveys and needs of the staff around questioning/discussion techniques, mathematical content and separate groups  aligned by grade priorities.    Areas of Focus:      4.2 Support the teacher teams with best pedagogical practices around vertical alignments, specifically in scaffolding  and differentiation across content areas. Ensure that teachers are using the professional learning time to create  lessons with multiple entry points so that all learners have an opportunity to access the curriculum vertically.       To further develop our teacher teams we will institute additional vertical team planning days throughout the year,  continue inter-visitations so teachers can give each other effective actionable feedback and use protocols during  teacher team meetings.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      1.2 Building on the established instructional practices, continue supporting teachers in improving their pedagogy by  promoting student engagement in rigorous discussions with multiple entry points across grades and disciplines.

Data sources include: Feedback from our Quality Review and PPO data shows our learning environment as an area of  celebration. However, we continue to work on developing school-wide and classroom systems to support a positive  approach to behavior management focused specifically on tier 2 and 3 students who require more individualized  systems to support their learning and social emotional well-being. Data from our learning environment survey and  OORS data shows that the area of classroom behaviors is an area of priority with an emphasis on particular students  who contribute to consistent OORS reports across the year.      Priority Needs: In conjunction with the PBIS structures, RULER tools, and restorative practices already in place at PS  396, we will be implementing Crisis Conferencing (piggy backing off of our Nest Case Conference system). These  conferences will allow staff to discuss and receive support to meet the needs of our at risk and high needs students.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Data was gathered from sources including: 2017-2018 MOTP observations; 2017-2018 peer intervisitations (two  rounds across the year); 2017-2018 instructional rounds (four cycles across the year, conducted by outside  administrators as well as internal teacher groups); 2017-2018 PPO feedback; and various sources of student data from  formative and summative assessments.    Trends in data indicate the following Priority Needs: Our learning environment is based on the belief system that  students learn best through a variety of learning experiences that tap students’ learning styles. Across classrooms  students work in centers using a wide variety of scaffolds and supports including, the use of manipulative material,  additional visual material, turn and talk opportunities and small group instruction. However, teacher questioning that  elevates and extends student thinking to more advanced levels of critical analysis and evaluation is not yet a  consistent practice school wide. A trend in teacher observations shows that staff is struggling with ways to plan for  highly engaging student-centered tasks and to give students action based feedback through formative assessments.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  We have designed an interview committee comprised of our most invested teachers, which has become an integral  part of the hiring process. The teachers on the committee are responsible for reviewing resumes, selecting  candidates, scheduling interviews and holding interviews. During each interview, committee members ask each  candidate a set of questions which were a product of a collaborative effort of the teachers and administration.  Committee members use a rubric designed by administration to rate the candidate’s responses. The data is recorded  and stored on Google Docs. If it has been determined by the interview committee that the candidate is a strong one  based on his/her responses, they hand the candidate a student work sample of his/her choosing. The candidate  analyzes the work sample and is asked to provide feedback to the committee after analyzing the work. The accuracy  of the feedback coupled with the strength of the candidate’s responses determines whether or not (s)he is invited to  perform a demonstration lesson at the school. After the candidate completes the demonstration lesson in a  class/grade (s)he would most likely be working if (s)he were to be hired, which is observed by administration and  teachers, (s)he has the opportunity to debrief the lesson and have a conversation with administration. The final part  of the hiring process consists of following up with the candidate’s references and reviewing the results of each step in  the interview process to determine whether or not the candidate will be asked to be a part of the staff. The candidate  is then contacted by administration about the decision that has been made.   New teachers are partnered with mentors; effective and highly effective tenured pedagogues. The mentors coach  new teachers to through non-evaluative observations and meetings where mentors provide feedback and support for  new teachers to improve their instructional practices as well as behavior management strategies. Our lead mentors  (3) have participated in additional training through the New Teacher Center and all mentors have completed the 12  hour mentor course. We are currently designing a teacher induction program for teachers new to the building that  includes regularly scheduled meetings for new teachers to inform teachers of protocols, regulations, drills,  compliance, school culture, common practices, school-wide expectations and routines, etc. and to provide a forum for  them to ask clarifying questions as the school year progresses.   The administrative cabinet, in collaboration with invested teachers, determine assignments based on teachers’  strengths, preferences, and the compatibility of staff members to maximize the potential for teacher success and  therefore student success.    Throughout the year administration works with its consultation partners to reach out to highly qualified candidates at  Hunter College and NYU. Additionally the school regularly receives requests for student teacher placements from   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Teachers College, Fordham and Bank Street College of Education. Administrators regularly conduct informal  assessments with student teachers and have successfully recruited full-time teachers through this process.    Additionally, our lead mentor, a veteran teacher and grade leader also supports new teachers through our portfolio  collaboration committee which offers assistance and support to any un-tenured teacher working towards the  completion of their probationary period.    Ongoing school-wide PD sessions are offered to all teachers including Teachers College lab-site days, Teachers College  PD days, Monday PD cycles, Co-teaching consultation, lunch and learns, Teacher Effectiveness sessions and additional  sessions regarding city-wide expectations.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   This year our Professional Learning Committee, comprised of administration and teachers, collaborate to determine  the professional learning that would best meet the needs of our teachers differentiating depending on teachers  experience and instructional practice, enabling all students to meet Common Core State Standards. The data collected  from teacher ratings, student data, and conversations had with teachers through IPCs, post-observation meetings,  and EYCs are all used in selecting the professional learning opportunities that will be offered to the staff. On-going  professional learning through the Teachers’ College Reading and Writing Project, Math in the City, as well as the ASD  Nest Support Project is offered to staff members on a regular basis throughout the year, through professional learning  workshops and regularly scheduled opportunities for teachers to meet with consultants from each organization.    The Professional Learning Committee is also responsible for designing professional learning for the 80 minute PD  sessions on Mondays. These sessions include, but not limited to: rounds of peer observation and opportunities for  teachers to provide non-evaluative feedback on those observations; teachers’ turn-keying information out of the  building professional learning workshops that is relevant to our school and student body; designing inquiry studies  where teacher self-select an area of focus based on their student data; and professional book clubs.    The Professional Learning Committee also designed a Summer Academy, giving new and veteran teachers the  opportunity to deepen their practice in preparation for the new school year.    Additional PD offered to teachers include:    Go Math Training, July 2018 – ongoing   Math in the City, July 2018 - ongoing    Teachers College Reading and Writing Project Summer Institutes, July - August 2018, Lab-sites and calendar days  September 2018 - ongoing         Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 396, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 396 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   PS 396 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

All  ELL students in gr. 2-5 will be invited to our Saturday Academy program, including students  who are in their first year following testing proficient on the NYSESLAT. The Saturday  Academy program will run January through April for four hours each session, and led by  certified ENL teachers. Students will be placed in co-teaching classrooms to allow for more  individualized attention and smaller group sizes (22 students maximum class with 2 teachers in  each class). Co-planning occurs during a minimum of one common prep each week and co- teaching between the ENL certified teacher and content area teacher. Additionally, teachers will  spend one hour every other Saturday, outside of instructional time, and engage in action research  around looking at student work and identifying implications for future instruction focused on  ELL-specific scaffolding to maintain rigor.    In addition to the materials used in school to help the students prepare for the exams, on  Saturdays students will be provided with supplemental materials, specifically for the Saturday  program.  Teachers in grade 2-5 will create targeted materials for the specific groups with which  they worked.  In addition, teachers in grades 3-5 will utilize test prep materials, specifically for  Saturdays, the STARS (Strategies to Achieve Reading Success) and STAMS (Strategies to  Achieve Mathematics Success) series books.    Students will be grouped according to proficiency level to allow for more targeted instruction.  Teachers will conduct ongoing running records every two weeks to ensure we are targeting the  necessary skills for each student to see literacy progress. The program will also use both literacy  and math games to create a fun and engaging session where students can work on skills.    Teachers will use the Imagine Learning program that conducts online assessments and creates  individualized instructional programs targeting specific areas of need for each students. Teachers  will instruct students using the Imagine Learning program as a supplemental resource. When  using the program on their own in the classroom, the duration will be 20 minutes per student and  will rotate through all of the students so that all ELL students in each class will have access to  the program at least 1 time, if not more, through their 6 classroom teachers. When in use out of  the classroom for small group instruction with the 3 ENL teachers, the program will be used for  30-45 minutes depending on the lesson for the day.    The program is focused on oral language, academic vocabulary, instruction in the five essential  components of reading, and strategic first-language support. Students will learn through videos,  pictures, glossaries, and direct translations. There is direction instruction, as well as games for   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   students. The program can be used individually or in small group format with the ENL or  classroom teacher.     All ELL students K-5 will also have access to Imagine Learning during the regular school week,  to be used to transfer learning from Saturday sessions, during supplemental instructional time  outside of mandated ENL service minutes and core instruction periods.    Attendance will be taken every morning upon arrival and families signed out their children  during dismissal each day.  Both records of attendance will be kept in a locked cabinet in a file in  the main office.  Parents will be notified in English and in their preferred language in writing (via  their child’s bookbag) whenever notifications are sent out (ex: the start of the program, when  program would not be held, etc.). In addition, teachers will meet with individual families to  discuss student progress and would inform parents of these meetings in person, by phone or in  writing.  These notifications were done in the parent’s preferred language as well (as were the  meetings themselves).    Families are given access to Imagine Learning to use at home, as well as activities and games  (both online and with manipulatives) to further connect the material taught on Saturdays.

The first  component involves sending the three ESL teachers to attend off-site workshops throughout the  school year.  Examples of workshops they are already signed up for include: New ESL Teacher  training (for ESL staff new to the profession), ESL Liaisons Meeting (for the ESL  Coordinator/Teacher), as well as Writing, Interactive Writing and Repeated Reading Can Be the  Forum for Moving Kids from Levels A/B to C—the Critical Work of This Month and The  Intersection of Reading Workshop and English Language Instruction: Using Reading to Teach  Language and Vice Versa.  Having the three ESL staff members attend trainings offered in the  city helps them grow professionally and better target their students' needs to increase academic  achievement.  The various workshops the three staff members will attend throughout the year  range from half to full day workshops and topics will range from ELL specific to classroom  based Literacy instruction, which benefits the ELLs in those rooms.  The workshops are provided  either through the NYC DOE or Teachers College.    A tentative schedule for off-site PD for our ELL teachers includes:  •     ELL Liaison workshop, TBA throughout the year  •     ELL Literacy workshop: The Intersection of Reading Workshop and English Language  Learners (TCRWP), Fall 2018  •     ELL Literacy workshop: Interactive Writing and Repeated Reading for English Language  Learners (TCRWP), Winter 2019  •     ELL Literacy workshop: Book Clubs and Partner Talk for English Language Learners  (TCRWP), Spring 2019   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      Part C: Professional Development   •     Sept-June: co-teaching/co-planning PD sessions between ESL and Common Branch teams  with special education consultant, through NYU (5-10 days across the year; on site)  •     Sept-June: ELL instruction study group with TCRWP staff developer (5 days across the  year; on site)    The second component of the professional development plan at PS 396 involves weekly, 45  minute, ESL Team Meetings amongst the three ESL staff members, lead by the ESL  Coordinator, which occur during the scheduled ESL Team Meeting period.  The purpose of these  meetings is to work collaboratively with each other to increase the cohesiveness of the ESL  department, stay current on new trends and best practices in the ESL field, and plan for targeted  instruction to increase the ELL students' knowledge and skills in the area of literacy, as assessed  through formal and informal assessments both in and out of their general education classrooms  and with the ESL team, as well as troubleshoot unexpected issues as they arise. Examples of  topics already covered include: streamlining the NYSITELL and LAB-R process, turnkeying  information on the Home Language Progressions and planning for implementing them, as well as  using them to track student growth over time, and professional development provided by the  ESL Coordinator to the new staff on Guided Reading, target small group instruction for  beginners and how to best use data to inform instruction.     The final component of the 396 professional development plan is having the ESL staff provide  professional development workshops to the rest of the staff.  This will happen at times during the  Monday PD block after school in 45 minute blocks.  The first workshop is tentatively scheduled  for December 2018 on Making the Classroom ELL Friendly: The Basics and will focus on  making language comprehensible, being sensitive to the needs of ELLs, and an introduction to  the difference between BICS and CALP.  Follow up workshops are planned on: Adapting Lesson  Plans for ELL Students: The SIOP Model (which will also include a focus on engagement,  higher order thinking and assessment) and Understanding Cultural Diverse Child Rearing  Practices to Better Understand the Whole Student (which focuses on looking at children through  the lens of their families).  Other opportunities for this learning occurs during 45-minute grade  level team meetings (during the school day), where the ENL staff members push in to train select  groups of staff on topics in 20-minute intervals on such topics as: Self-Assessment on How ELL  Friendly your Classroom Is, BICS vs. CALP by Grade, New Language Progressions in General  Education Classroom with Your ELL Students and NYSESLAT Test Prep.      The materials needed for these workshops will consist of staff-made PowerPoints, handouts, and  DVDs.  The three ESL teachers will run these workshops for the staff.  While they will be doing them  during school hours they will still exceed the weekly student times for their ESL students.  All  three ENL teachers push in to classrooms for 500 minutes per week, leaving an additional 150  minutes beyond the requirement for Beginner and Intermediate ESL students and an additional  320 minutes beyond for Advanced ENL students.  Workshops (for all staff and/or small groups  of staff) will occur about once a month.    Prior to attending a PD, teachers submit the agenda to the principal for approval.  While at the  PD the teacher signs the attendance sheet for the workshop, which is also shared with the school  upon request. After attending the workshop each PS 396 ENL teacher submits additional  materials to share with other related staff and turnkeys the event in the building to share the  knowledge learned.  If the event is held in house copies of the attendance are maintained in  locked cabinet in the office along with a copy of the agenda.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as  parent orientation during ELL identification process.     rationale       schedule and duration      name of provider    how parents will be notified of these activities   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             Parent engagement activities occur in two primary formats at PS 396, with other activities  occurring on an ongoing basis (including ELL team collaboration and planning of individualized  sessions with parents of ELLs during weekly parent engagement blocks).  Many of the parents at  PS396 are ELLS themselves.  They struggle with the English language and want support in  learning the language better.  In addition, they also have difficulty helping their children at home  with the academics and ask for support in helping their children.  They want to support their  children academically but are often unsure of how to do this.  Are ESL Parent Course helps  parents learn English, while are Parent Workshop series provides them with strategies for  working with their children at home to support them with the curriculum.   The first format is the ESL Parent Course, where parents learn English from 2 staff members,  both of whom are certified in Reading Recovery and one is a certified Bilingual teacher.  This  course runs 3 days per week from October-May for about 29 weeks and is 60 minutes in duration  per class.  Parents learn how to speak, listen, read and writing in English during this  time.  Parents were notified about participating in the class through translated flyers that went  home, as well as through direct conversations in the home language.   Parents will be active participants in the ESL Parent Course- it will be completely centered  around them- the focus being for them to increase in reading, writing, listening and speaking  through participation and activities.    The Parent Workshop series involves parents and their children.  Parents are taught through  direct instruction and modeling how to do specific activities with their children and then  immediately practice doing them with their children as teachers circulate to provide coaching  and answer questions.    The second format of activities for parent engagement at PS 396 involves having the ESL staff  members run parent workshops throughout the year, targeted towards parents of ELLs.  These  workshops are 60 minutes in length and will occur either at the start of the school day after  parents drop off their children or immediately after school.  Providing both time frames is  important for parents to ensure that more parents can attend, as a result of time constraints  related to work, day care, etc.  The first of these scheduled workshops will occur in December  2014.  Topics to be covered during the year include: How to Help Your Child with Reading at  Home, How to Help your Child with Writing at Home, How to Help Your Child with Math at  Home, How to Help Your Child with Homework at Home and How to Prepare Your Child for  the NYSESLAT. Workshop topics will be subdivided into grades K-2 and 3-5 so as to better  target the content.  Parents will be notified by translated letters going home in bookbags, as well  as orally in the home language.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56   Part D: Parental Engagement Activities      The ENL Parent Course is run by Myrna Mendez (also a licensed ENL Teacher)    The Parent Workshop Series is run by the 3 ENL Teachers: Dr. Katie Prince, Sam Greet, and  Sophia Harrington.    Parent invitations are sent out in English and in the parents’ preferred language in students’  bookbags.  Parents are also reminded at arrival and dismissal in their preferred language.  When  parents arrive at a workshop they sign an attendance sheet.  The attendance sheet and a copy of  the agenda are then store in a locked cabinet in the main office.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  ELL early literacy assessments include NYSITELL and Teacher's College Reading Writing Project (TWRWP) assesments*, NYC ELA  Performance Task (K-2 MOSL),  and the NYS ELA performance (3-5), NYS Math performance (3-5) and NYS Science performance  (4th) provide additional data points. *Teacher's College Reading Writing Project (TCRWP) assessments include Letter  Identification, Letter Sound identification, Concepts of Print, Sight Word assessment, Spelling Inventory and Running Records  for reading with comprehension monitoring.  The data from these assessments is used to determine the progression of  students' literacy skills, to establish an RTI focus for individual groups of students, and to identify target areas of instruction  across the school, grade, or within a specific class. This year, the school-wide data reveals a pattern across the grades of  students demonstrating limited comprehension levels.  As a result, the school-wide approach towards reading instruction  shifted to focus on increasing students' comprehension skills.  The school has enlisted the help of Teacher's College  consultants to help train teachers in developing students' comprehension across different grade bands. Specifically, for ENLs,  school-wide data reveals that a majority of ENLs performed below grade level at the end of 2018:a) In Kindergarten, 0 of our 5   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      ENL students met the end of year benchmark reading level.   b)In 1st grade 1 out of 6 ENLs  met the end of year benchmark reading level, while the rest performed below.  c) In 2nd grade  3 out of 11 ENLs met the end of year benchmark reading level, while the rest performed below.d) In 3rd grade 5 out of 21 ELLs  met the end of the year benchmark reading level, while the rest performed below.e) In 4th grade 0 out of 17 ELLs met the the  end of year benchmark reading level, while the rest performed below.f) In 5th grade 1 student surpassed the benchmark,  while the remaining 16 performed below. This data will inform the school's instructional plan for ENLs in various ways.  ENL  teachers will engage in Inquiry to analyze student writing in order to identify and target gaps that affect ENLs' ability to write  independently on a variety of topics, as addressed by the Common Core Standards.  As a result of this inquiry work, ENL  teachers will be able to collaborate and share materials and instructional resources that can improve the literacy skills of ENLs,  so that they may show improvement in the reading and writing modalities of the NYSESLAT.  In addition, ENL teachers are also  participating in labsites with TC consultants across various grades.  This will enable teachers to use best practices learned from  the consultants to improve students' comprehension as they transtion from one level to the next.          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   TCRWP staff developers provide grade specific lab-sites throughout the school year, including a special focus on writing  conferences, small group interventions and data analysis and planning.  Additional, TCRWP calendar days as well as ENL mini- institute days will support teachers in their application of reading and writing units throughout the year.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of ELL programs is determined by evidence of growth on the NYSESLAT.  Last year 42 out of 66 ELLs across the  grades made progress on the NYSESLAT by at least one level.  14 students made progress from Entering to  Emerging/Transitioning.  5 students made progress from Entering to Expanding.  1 student in Kindergarten made progress  from Entering to Expanding.   8 students made progress from Emerging/Transitioning to Expanding. 14 students made progress  from Expanding to Commanding.  This  data demonstrates that ENLs are being provided with targeted instruction to meet their  language needs and therefore showing progress on the NYSESLAT.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    TCRWP staff developers provide grade specific lab-sites throughout the school year, including a special focus on writing  conferences, small group interventions and data analysis and planning.  Additional, TCRWP calendar days as well as ENL mini- institute days will support teachers in their application of reading and writing units throughout the year.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Grade-wide data is used to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention framework. Students across the  grade receive Tier 1 Common Core Aligned instruction following the Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Project learning  progressions and, in the classes with ELLs, with the support of ESL strategies as part of the Co-Teaching model.  On-going  assessments such as Running Records, Concepts of Print assessments, Sight Word Inventories and Reading Comprehension are  used to determine if students are mastering the skills being provided by instruction in Tier 1. If these assessments reveal that  they are not, students with similar needs are grouped together and assigned to a specific skill group in which they received  targeted Tier 2 instruction.  Both ELLs and Non-ELLs are grouped together to receive Tier 2 instruction in small groups.  As the  students master these skills, they are reassessed and reassigned to different groups as needed.:          6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Based on an analysis of student performance on the 2015 NYSESLAT, there is evidence of growth for students across all levels  of the NYSESLAT.  Students across all grades showed progess from Beginner or Intermediate to Advanced and  Proficient.  There is also evidence of students attaining proficiency in Kindergarten, First Grade, Fourth Grade and Fifth  Grade.  There are also some negative trends within the results of the NYSESLAT.  Despite growth across all grades, there is also  evidence of students remaining as either Entering (predominantly new comers) or Expanding for the duration of the year.  The   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         data from the 2015 NYSESLAT is outlined below:  a) In Kindergarten, 5 students made progress from Expanding to Commanding, 1 student made progress from Entering to  Commanding, 2 students made progress from Entering to Expanding, 1 student made progress from Entering to  Emerging/Transitioning and 2 students remained at Expanding.  b) In First Grade, 3 students made progress form Entering to Emerging/Transitioning, 1 student made progress form Entering  to Expanding, 2 students made progress from Emerging/Transitioning to Expanding, 3 students made progress from Expanding  to Commanding, 3 new comers remained Entering, 1 student remained at Emerging/Transitioning, and 1 student remained at  Commanding.  c) In Second Grade, 2 student made progress from Entering to Emerging/Transitioning, 1 student made progress from  Emerging/Transitioning to Expanding, 4 students remained at Expanding.  d) In Third Grade, 4 students made progress from Entering to Emerging/Transitioning, 2 students made progress form  Emerging/Transitioning to Expanding, and 3 remained at Expanding.   e) In Fourth Grade, 3 students made progress from Expanding to Commanding, 3 students made progress from Entering to  Emerging/Transitioning, 1 student made progress from Entering to Expanding, 2 student made progress from  Emerging/Transitioning to Expanding and 4 students remained at Expanding, 1 student remained at Entering and 4 new  comers remained Entering.  f) In Fifth Grade, 1 student made progress from Entering to Emerging/Transitioning, 1 student made progress from  Emerging/Transitioning to Commanding, 1 student made progress form Emerging/Transitioning to Expanding, 3 students made  progress form Expanding to Commanding, and 1 student remained as Entering as a new comer.     This data reveals a pattern of growth marked by students progressing from either Entering or Emerging/Transitioning to  Expanding and Commanding, but also reflects a trend of students remaining at Entering (newcomers) or remaining at  Expanding for two consecutive years, with the exception of two students in Kindergarten.  Of the 9 students that remained  Entering across all the grades, 7 were recent newcomers at the time they took the NYSESLAT.  This means they may not have  received a full year of English Instruction or were just completing their first full year, and thus, they did not show progress on  the NYSESLAT.     As a result of this trend of students remaining at the Expanding level across all grades, the ELL team devised an ELL Inquiry to  determine trends that may contribute to students' the lack of progress over the course of the year, and to develop a focus of  instruction to target the needs of students at this level as they transition from Expanding to Commanding .     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Grade team and ENL/administrative department meetings will give us time and space to analyze the data, assess trends, and  revise our curriculum and student placement accordingly.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Instruction for ELLs is delivered primarily through a push-in Co-Teaching model. ELLs are grouped heterogeneously in  classrooms  with non-ELLs.  Co-teachers in General Education classrooms consist of an ENL teacher and the classroom  teacher.  Co-teachers plan  and deliver Common Core aligned lessons using varying co-teaching models including parallel teaching, which allows   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         for small  group instruction focusing on the needs of ELLs.

If applicable.      N/A    2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   There are currently 3 ENL teachers that service students in grades K-5.  Each teacher services students in two grades.   This  ensures  that students that are Entering and Emerging receive 360 minutes of service weekly and that students that are  Transitioning and Expanding receive 180 minutes each week.  ENL teachers push-in to classrooms to provide instruction in  Reading, Writing and sometimes Math.  They work with students whole class or in small groups as determined by their  mandated minutes.  In addition, ENL teachers provide pull-out service for intervention as needed.     Students at the Entering and Emerging levels of English proficiency receive all instruction from the ENL teacher through Free  Standing ENL periods (minimum 360 per week). Students at the Transitioning and Expanding levels of English proficiency  receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction and 180 minutes of ELA instruction or Content Instruction. ENL instruction is delivered  as ELL-targeted strategies that support students' language needs in accessing core curriculum, as supplemental to Tier I  instruction. ELA instruction is delivered within the literacy block (TCRWP Reading Workshop and Writing Workshop), as  scaffolding to support students in being successful in meeting CCLS ELA standards.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      The language of instruction for the Free Standing ENL program is English across all content areas.  Students receive ENL push- in support during the literacy block, and sometimes Math.  ENL and classroom teachers provide instruction using the Teacher's  College Reading and Writing Project learning progressions.  Through TC, students are encouraged to read and write across  various content areas.  This means they are exposed to various genres and content areas including Social Studies and Science  during the literacy block, in addition to receiving instruction in Science and Social Studies during the allotted time periods.  As a  result, ESL teachers are engaged in providing content-area instruction along with language support while servicing ELLs.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELLs are evaluated in their native language formally using the Language Assessment Battery in Spanish when they first  enter.  The score attained from this test indicates how proficient students are in their native language.  While students receive  English language instruction throughout the year, ENL teachers who speak students' native language have opportunities to  informally assess ELLs in their native language during student conferences, primarily to determine if their level of  understanding is due to language or another factor such as limited comprehension.  This helps teacher's decide if a student will  benefit from direct native language instruction to explain a specific concept with translation support.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.   Long Term   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      e.   Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a) All ENL and classroom teachers are made explicitly aware of their Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) so that  they can plan accordingly to meet the needs of these unique students.  In previous years, appropriately leveled materials for  SIFE learning have been gathered by the ELL Coordinator and distributed to the classroom teachers.  SIFE are also included in  Title III enrichment programs for ELLs.  Additionally, teachers incorporate strategies from the ASD Nest program in the school  to support the social-emotional development of our at-risk SIFE students (who likely have not had the opportunity to build  academic confidence in school). Teachers within the ASD Nest program participate in regular professional development on  social-emotional needs and strategies, and share their learning with colleagues across the school in forums such as day-long  professional development and “lunch and learns.”     b.) A plan for newcomers centers around easing children’s adjustment to our school, and fostering a welcoming environment.  Classroom instruction, as always, must be sensitive to how the differences between a student’s home culture and their new  culture may impact both their learning style and general behavior/interaction.  In addition, sensitivity must be paid to  particular issues that may arise in the families of newcomers, such as immigration, home ownership, and English language  learning at the parent level.     With newcomers in the beginning stages of language acquisition, teachers make language comprehensible by modifying their  speech (e.g., slower rate, simpler grammatical structures, restricted length of communication) and making use of extra  linguistic cues (i.e., gestures, actions, and pictures) to convey meaning.  Reading activities provide opportunities for further  language input. Predictable books are particularly useful because of their highly repetitive language and simplified  text.  Chants and songs also offer students the opportunity to gain familiarity with content vocabulary and language  patterns.  Teachers can scaffold the language of the text through engagements such as read-alouds and shared reading.     Furthermore, families of newcomers are supported through parent workshops, including parent orientation, meetings with  the Parent Coordinator, and additional support requested through the Parent Association or on an individual basis.     c.) Differentiated instruction for ELLs receiving 4 to 6 years of service is is embedded in various  programs/interventions.  During instruction, teachers present both content objectives and language objectives that are  created in collaboration with the ENL Co-teacher.  To develop foundational literacy skills, the Wilson program is used.  Wilson  Focuses on phonemic awareness and letter/word recognition.  Targeted small group reading interventions are also  used.  These center on improvement in specific areas of need based on the student’s instructional level.  Finally, Go Math, the  math curriculum is used to develop student’s math and  computational skills.  In addition to these in-school services and programs, there is a Saturday Academy that provides targeted  instruction for students in testing grades.  The Saturday Academy is specifically targeted towards ELLs.     d.) Differentiated instruction is embedded for long term ELLs that have have 6 or more years of service. In the classroom,  students have both language and content objectives that are created in a cooperative manner between the classroom and ENL  teacher.  The Wilson Fundations program focuses on phonemic awareness, spelling and word recognition.  Targeted small  group reading intervention centers on improvement in specific areas of need and is based on the student’s instructional level.  The Saturday Academy is  offered to students in testing grades and specifically targets ELLs. There is also AIS push in and pull  out for Reading and Math.     e.) Former ELLs (those that attained Proficiency on the NYSESLAT) receive language support on an on-going basis.   These  students are placed in monolingual classes, with Expanding level ENL students, as well as English-dominant students. Newly  proficient  students, Commanding students, are supported by a certified ESL teacher in push-in periods (minimum of 90  minutes/week). Students who reach proficiency on the NYSESLAT receive two additional years of test accommodations. They  receive extended time (time and a half) as well as separate location for all exams.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      ELL-SWDs have IEPs, and receive a range of special education services ranging from ICT classes to general education classes  with related services.  During intake, we place students in special education when appropriate, according to evaluation by the  CSE, as well as their IEP.  Based on CSE and IEP recommendations, ELLs are placed in monolingual classes with ENL  services.  Students are reevaluated as necessary by our Instructional Support Team.  Later, students are mainstreamed where  appropriate.     Students with special needs are case conferenced during weekly meetings with classroom teachers and related service  providers.  These meetings are designed to support teachers in collaboratively determining appropriate strategies to meet  students’ individual needs.     As specifically related to content and language acceleration, the Principal is a certified trainer of Quality Teaching for English  Learners (QTEL), and the Assistant Principal has received extensive training in QTEL. As per the QTEL materials, “Instead of  simplifying the curriculum and lowering expectations for English language learners, QTEL offers an academic framework rich in  intellectual challenge along with high-level support. The QTEL approach of providing high-challenge, high-support learning  opportunities develops teacher expertise and raises student achievement.”          7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  All ELL-SWDs are placed within the least restrictive environment. Our ELLs with IEPs are incorporated into our Integrated Co- Teaching Classes (ICT), and receive primarily push-in services, to keep them in their mainstream class setting as much as  possible.  These settings are regularly reviewed at IEP meetings and weekly case conference meetings, held amongst teachers  and service providers.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  All of our ELLs receive Academic Intervention Services (AIS) according to their assessed needs. ELL needs are targeted through  item- and skills-analysis of ongoing assessment such as student conferences; in-house formative assessment such as TC  running records; summative assessment which include on-demand writing and performance tasks; and formal summative  assessment which include the LAB-R, NYSESLAT; NYS ELA, Math, and Science.     Based on baseline and unit assessments in mathematics, students are assigned to small group intervention with one of our  mathematics AIS providers. Additionally, students receive support through our Title III program, which focuses on building  comprehension through targeting academic vocabulary.     As literacy is a fundamental element of language learning, students receive a comprehensive range of support services in  developing their reading and writing skills. Targeted students work with guided reading specialists one-on-one or in small  intervention groups; language of instruction is according to student need (English or Spanish, based on dominant language in  literacy).  All students receive small group instruction during their literacy block, with the support of teachers in addition to  their classroom teacher.   All ELL students are eligible for our Title III supplemental program, in which literacy is addressed by a  bilingual certified literacy specialist.     Intervention services are also provided in the content areas. In Science, the Science teacher collaborates with ENL teachers to  work with students in small groups to provide native language support in the content concepts and vocabulary, as well as  targeted exam preparation for students who will take the NYS Science exam in Spanish. In Social Studies, cluster teachers on  each grade collaborate with the ENL teacher to provide push-in services to support students in small groups during  instructional time, using language-appropriate strategies to scaffold content learning for students.            9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      Co-teaching will be full-day in classrooms in place of partial day to address the need of more content area instruction.               10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs across all grades are afforded equal access to all school programs.  Invitations to join all programs, including afterschool  programs are open to all students including ELLs.  Supplemental services that are offered to ELLs include AIS services in literacy  and math, tutoring, and Saturday Academy.  Afterschool programs are diverse and fun-filled.  ELLs are welcomed to participate  in the arts through the school's after school Art Club as well as Reader's Theater and Musical Theater.  Annually, the musical  theater club puts on musical productions where student actors, which include ELLs, perform on stage before an audience of  parents, students and friends from other schools.  ELLs also participate in other after school clubs including the Technology  club, Healthy Living, Minute to Win it, Sports Time, and more.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  There are various instructional materials including technology used to support ELLs. ELLs are exposed to the same rigorous  texts and instructional materials that other students are, with embedded supports for language provided by the ENL  teacher.  This means that instructional materials are not necessarily different for ELLs.  Instead, they are scaffolded to provide  appropriate entry points based on their language needs.  Such scaffolding includes use of visuals, paraphrasing, explanation of  vocabulary, use of gestures and total physical response.  In addition, shared reading of complex texts is used as an instructional  strategy, providing ELLs access to rich literature and engaging students in rich oral language discussions that are scaffolded by  the ENL teacher.      Technology is used for instruction across all content areas through the use of SmartBoards in the classroom.  In addition,  classroom teachers have access to iPads and student laptops which are used to reinforce learning through interactive media  with all students, including ELLs.  Technology provides ELLs with additional language experiences that target language learning  across the different modalities.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   English is the primary language of instruction the the Free Standing ENL program.  However, native language support is  provided in various ways when ENL teachers have knowledge of a students native language.  Native language translations are  used as the teacher sees fit facilitate learning in the second language.  One way native language is used is to help students  identify cognates in the target language.  Another way is to help understand abstract vocabulary when visuals and other  scaffolds aren't sufficient.  Native language is also used to communicate with families about student progress.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Required services support and resources correspond appropriately to ELLs' ages and grade levels.  There is a balance between  the resources and materials that are on the students levels, and those that are used to engage students in complex reading,  listening, and thinking tasks that require more rigor.  Teachers build foundational skills in reading and writing using appropriate  leveled materials and encourage students to read at their independent reading levels to build comprehension and stamina.  Teachers also use complex grade-level and above grade-level texts to expose students to rich literary language and develop  higher order thinking and comprehension skills as suggested by the Common Core Standards.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    There are various instructional materials including technology used to support ELLs. ELLs are exposed to the same rigorous  texts and instructional materials that other students are, with embedded supports for language provided by the ENL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65         teacher.

Technology provides ELLs with additional languge experiences that target language learning  across the different modalities.        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   ENL and classroom teachers always provide a welcoming environment for new ELLs at the beginning of the year, and  throughout the year.  At the beginning of the year ENL teachers and the ELL coordinator host the ELL Parent Orientation in  which parents receive information about the ELL program choices as well as an overview of the expectations for ELLs and what  they will be learning throughout the year.  This helps parents feel at ease, as they get to know the school culture and  understand the curriculum.  In the classroom,  ENL and classroom teachers take time to introduce ELLs to other students in the  class. when they first arrive  ELLs are often assigned a Language Partner that helps them to interpret and understand  instructions provided in English when they are out of the classroom.  Partners help new ELLs to navigate the school and  communicate with others.          17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A.       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The professional development plan for ELL personnel is as follows:  All teachers including ENL teachers engage in Professional  Development either in or outside of the school.  Teachers are encouraged to seek professional development opportunities that  will benefit instruction.  Teachers are also sent to Professional Development workshops that are geared towards developing  the Danielson competencies, based on recommendations from the Principal and Assistant Principal.  When teachers  attend  Professional Development workshops, they complete a school survey outlining what was learned and how they plan to  implement contents form the workshop into their practice.  Teachers also turnkey information learned to other teachers  through lunch-and-learns and at grade meetings.  A sample of ELL-targeted PD opportunities provided to staff includes:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         09/26: Reading and Writing Non-fiction for ELLs Institute: Scaffold for Success (OELL) - ENL teachers & Common Branch  10/18: CCLS Mathematics Institute for Elementary Teachers of ELLs (OELL) - ENL teachers & Common Branch  11/06: ELL Elementary Literacy Conference (OELL) - ENL teachers & Common Branch  12/05: New ENL Teacher Training (OELL) - ENL teachers  01/14: RTI for ELLs (OELL) - ENL teachers, Common Branch, administrators  02/06: Writing for the Sciences (TCRWP) - Science teachers  03/18: Reading and Writing Nonfiction for ELLs Institute: Scaffold for Success (OELL) - ENL tecahers & Common Branch  04/09: Literacy lab sites (TCRWP) - ENL teachers, Common Branch, administrators  05/22: ELL Instructional Meeting (CFN) - ENL teachers & administrators  06/12: Literacy curriculum planning (TCRWP) - ENL teachers, Common Branch, administrators      Teachers of ENLs attend professional development geared towards supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core  Learning Standards.  Teachers across the grades attend lab-sites and meetings with TC consultants to learn best practices for  teaching Reading and Writing.  TC consultants also address the needs of ELLs by providing demonstrations, hand-outs and  relevant research to inform a teacher's practice.  In addition, teachers of ELLs attend Professional Development outside of the  school and communicate their learning to other teachers at the school on an on-going basis.          2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The staff is supported as they help ENLs transition from elementary to middle school.  The guidance counselor works closely  with teachers, communicating which middle schools in the neighborhood and throughout the city offer specialized programs  for English Language Learners. We also hold parent workshops beginning in the fall, around the middle school selection  process. Oral and written communication/information provided in these workshops are offered in the parents’ home  language.     The minimum 7.5 hours of ELL training for all staff as per Jose P. is provided in the following ways: All staff members are  included in school-wide workshops related to best practices for ELLs (specifically drawing from QTEL and SIOP approaches,  delivered by QTEL-trained Principal), beginning in the summer, including: paraprofessionals, guidance counselors,  psychologists, occupational/physical therapists, speech therapists, secretaries, and parent coordinators.  ENL teachers and  their general education co-teachers will take part in an ongoing PD series on developing co-planning and co-teaching  strategies. ENL and general education co-teachers will be sent to co-teaching PD offered through the NYCDOE Office of ELLs, as  well as the Friday/Saturday ELL Institutes and PD sponsored by NYC-RBERN, focused on establishing a balanced literacy  program for ELLs. Additionally, all ESL teachers are included in school-wide lab-site days lead by our Teachers College Literacy  Staff Developers.  Staff who work with ELLs, who do not hold ENL or bilingual licenses, are invited to attend our ELL  professional development sessions (including: teachers, School Base Support Team (SBST), and reading AIS teachers). Teachers  are able to arrange their preparatory periods in order to attend, as the topics pertain to them.               Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?         Individual Meetings for the Parents of ELLs are held once a year during a time when there are no parent-teacher  conferences.  Notices are sent home with times for parents to pick from and if none of the pre-arranged times work, parents  can write in a date/time that works for them.  Parents then come in and meet with the ENL teacher that works with their child   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67         and meet to discuss the progress of their own child with that ENL teach as it relates to his/her English Language  Learning.  What was discussed at the meeting is documented (in English and the parent's native language) and all parties that  are present sign.  The parent gets a copy and the original is filed in the student's CUM in the main office.  *If the ENL teacher  does not speak the parent's preferred language of communication, translation is provided (and arranged ahead of  time).                 2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  ELL parents are involved in all aspects of the school.  ELL parents participate in open school night to meet with the teachers, as  audience members at performances by the Musical Theater group, as bingo players in the school's Annual Bingo Night, among  many others.  P.S. 396 has developed a Title I Parent Involvement Policy.  The purpose of the policy is to help parents navigate  through the NYC school system, and to become partners in their children’s education.  This plan has been developed in  consultation with parents across the years, and modified as the needs of our parents have changed. Assessed as well  requested needs of the families who comprise our school community have impacted on our plan each year.       Families in temporary housing and foster care parents will receive targeted support from our bilingual Parent Coordinator,  bilingual Guidance Counselor, and any other relevant support staff.  Specific help groups and workshops will be employed  according to family need. Our Parent Coordinator is in place to support parents with identified needs, while employing  Epstein’s six types of parent involvement to increase community engagement. The success of our parent program will be based  upon increased parent involvement across the year.     Parent and student rights and responsibilities are set with clear expectations in the Principal’s beginning of the year letter to  parent as well as in our School Parent Compact.  Additionally Parent Curriculum Orientation, which takes place at the  beginning of the school year, also includes Student and Parents Rights and Responsibilities as it applies to daily classroom  practice.     Parents are able to address their particular concerns through contacting their child’s teacher, through calling the school or  writing a note to the teacher.  Parent may also request a meeting with the resource staff that will provide them with additional  assistance for any social emotional and educational problems they may identify, i.e.: Guidance Counselor, Grade Supervisor,  Principal, or a member of our School Based Support Team.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Nicole Tine, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 396                                                                              School DBN: 10X396  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Recent research emphasizes the importance of parent involvement in promoting school success. Building a  positive home/school connection supports student learning. Using the findings from our school, we find that P.S.  396 needs translation services/oral interpretation in both Spanish and Arabic; our greatest need being in Spanish  (198 students). During the registration process parents fill out the HLIS (Home Language Identification Survey),  which helps assess parents' needs. We also use ATS Reports from data compiled during the rest of registration  and other areas (including blue cards, parent surveys, etc.) to help assess data parents' needs. This information  helps us to better serve our parent community and their language needs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72      We use use a combination of in-house interpretation and translation, as well as utilize the services of the  Translation and Interpretation Unit to help with over the phone translation and langauge interpretation when  needed.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      Members of our administration, counseling and crisis team all speak Spanish and are able to communicate with  families in the event of an emergency. In addition, we can use the "Over-the-Phone Interpreter Services" to  communicate with families who speak Arabic, as well as when a Spanish-speaking staff member is unavailable to  translate. Teachers and staff have been trained in the use of and have a copy of the "Over-the-Phone Interpreter  Services Desk Aid", which can be used in an Emergency to communicate with any family member, regardless of which  language the staff member speaks.   The school also uses "Hello Parent Phone Script" which allows parents and school staff who do not speak the same  language, on the phone, even in an emergency. Staff and parents are trained in how to use this three-way calling that  works when parents call the school or when the school calls the home.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77      When the school needs to send messages to large numbers of families at one time, we use ROBO Call. We are able to  send messages bilingually.               Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Staff are advised of all Chancellor's Regulations within our Staff Handbook. parents.       The school will also plan a PD where the School Language Coordinator and the staff of the ENL Department will train  school staff on the various language resources available to them, for example: how to use and when to use over the  phone interpretation, oniste interpreteres and Hello Parent Phone Script (which helps parents whose language is not  English communicate with school staff by phone).    An online toolkit will be created for staff and additional support will be provided on an on-going basis.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Translated copies of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities document that states the rights in regard to  translation and interpretation services is sent home.    We will continue to print and display throughout different locations in the school translated signs advising the parents  of the availability of interpretation services.   In addition we regularly send out bilingually translated materials to families.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       A parent survey is used to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of translation services. The  survey is translated into languages of parents at the school. When needed "Over-the-Phone Translation Services" are  also used.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78
