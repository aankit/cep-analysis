This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      By creating and maintaining a team environment in which teachers, administrators and parents work with each child  to help him/her meet exceptionally high academic standards consistent with the Chancellor's initiatives, PS 9 strives  to fulfill the mission, "EVERY CHILD IN PS 9 WILL SUCCEED".    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 9 is located on the Upper West side of Manhattan in New York City. We are fortunate to be located in a diverse  neighborhood filled with cultural institutions, commercial landmarks and a vibrant population. Our school partners  (both formally and informally) with several groups in order to offer students experience in the fine arts aligned with  each grade’s curriculum including but not limited to: The American Museum of Natural History, The Children’s  Museum of Manhattan, The New York City Ballet, Carnegie Hall, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and The Museum  of Modern Art and Landmark West.    Students at PS 9 learn about neighborhoods and communities throughout their primary education. The school’s  location is ideal for hands-on learning, located near the US Post Office, the 20th Police Precinct, Engine 74 Fire  department and a public library.    Students in the upper grades have an enriched Social Studies curriculum as well. Students in grade 3 visit museums,  cultural neighborhoods and dine on ethnic cuisines. Grade 4 takes a boat trip along the Hudson River and a trip to  support the unit of study around Colonial America.    PS 9 provides a mixture of integrated and differentiated curriculum that is strongly enriched with instruction in art,  music, technology, and foreign language. This rich curriculum promotes high academic achievement with challenging  content for all students. A strong network of support services, the parent teacher association and the school  leadership team contribute to our success in fostering a cohesive and cooperative educational community.      In recent years, PS 9 has received recognition for being a high performing school and we received the rating of “Well  Developed” in each of the areas of the Quality Review in January of 2015. Additionally, in July of 2016, we were  awarded the "Elizabeth Rohatyn Prize for Schools Where Teaching Matters". This recognition validates our work  around developing teacher leadership and sharing "best practices". The philosophy of the school is based on a  commitment to providing equity for all children. Our dedicated staff participates in ongoing staff development; in  addition to meetings designed to facilitate the individual needs of students in all programs, teachers in each grade  work collaboratively across classes and grades. As a result, teaching methodology and practices are designed to  better serve the needs of all children. Mentor support is available to all teachers, and yearly Learning Walks have  been designed to support ongoing professional learning. We have developed partnerships with similar schools to  share best practices.   In recent years, we were awarded the designation of one of New York State's “high performing gap closing schools”.  We were given this designation because we met all applicable state standards for English Language Arts,  Mathematics and Science and also made Adequate Yearly Progress in all areas. The award is tangible evidence of our  ongoing commitment to improve student achievement. We are also a "Respect For All" school, which evidences our  commitment to developing the social/emotional lives of children.    Celebrations are integral to life at PS 9. Throughout the year, classrooms celebrate their accomplishment as units of  study are completed; all families are invited to participate. Culminating performances and exhibitions in the arts and  math have become a yearly tradition. PS 9 has an outstanding home-school relationship. Parents are active  participants in learning, community-building, fund-raising, and spirit activities. Our parent fund-raising pays for an   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      assistant teacher in every classroom, Spanish and Chess enrichment programs, and additional funding for art and  music.      Over the last several years, we have focused on developing, “rigorous instruction that is customized, inclusive,  motivating and aligned to the Common Core”. Using a cycle of inquiry, professional development and assessment,  we have engaged staff in learning communities around; Number Talks, Cognitively Guided Instruction, Orton- Gillingham, Talk Moves and Accountable Talk, Hess’ Depth of Knowledge as well as differentiation and providing  multiple entry points so that all students have access to the standards.      Several years of focused work has impacted the students directly. In 2017, 80% of all students received levels 3 or 4  in ELA with 86% scoring levels 3 and 4 in Math. This represents a 2% increase in both areas, from the previous year  and a 7% increase since 2015 in ELA and a 4% increase since 2015 in Math. The School Quality Snapshot 20016-2017  reports that in ELA, 18% of students who previously scored a Level I or 2, increased their performance to a level 3 or  4 and 44% of students who scored a Level I or 2 in Mathematics, showed growth to a level 3 or 4. In 2017, in ELA,  43% of our "lowest third" performed at grade level, earning a Level 3. In Mathematics, 54% of our "lowest third"  earned a Level 3. The Quality Review states, “All students have a range of opportunities to both build skill as well as  dig deeply into important topics. The curriculum ensures that students are engaged in challenging tasks that require  them to think, reflect and problem solve.” The Quality Review in January of 2015 awarded “Well Developed” in each  of the five areas, including “Rigorous instruction” and “Collaborative Teaching”.          3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The numbers of ENL students remain statistically the same, and the number of students with special education needs  increases incrementally each year at approximately 3%. Our Special Education numbers have increased to 20% from  16% in 2015. We have been very successful in meeting their needs and work continually to ensure that all students  have access to the very rigorous curriculum.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.        We began looking at the concept of “feedback” several years ago, when the QR report indicated that students know  to get feedback from their peers, but describes that when they need support, they use anchor charts, graphic  organizers, mentor texts, and their teacher- NOT their peers. We began by implementing peer conferencing across  the grade levels and have begun the work of calibrating it across the grades.    We conducted an in-house survey this which indicated that while the majority of students had received “actionable”  feedback from a peer that they could use to improve their work in the academic area of Writing, there was less peer  feedback self-reported in Math and Reading.    We have shared best practices across the grades, and have begun to do some work around John Hattie and “Visible  Learning”. Through collaborative teacher discussion and ongoing professional development, we have come to  understand that magnitude of the undertaking and are now prepared, with further PD support, to focus on  developing a school-wide rubric for feedback and for exploring focused ways to ensure that the feedback that is  provided to each student is actionable, whether it is from the teacher or from a peer.    The results of an in-house survey administered in June 2017, indicate that 78% of students responded that their  teachers have taught them how to leave specific and actionable feedback for classmates. The same survey  disseminated in June of 2018 showed that number increase to 87%.    Teachers self-report a growing confidence with using technology as a way to expand their curriculum. As a school we  have worked very hard this year to provide professional development around the use of Promethean boards, as well  as Google Classroom and other sites which highlight collaboration. With an infusion of support from the PA, we  received 120 more Chromebooks, allowing teachers and classrooms to have more consistent access to these tools.    Drawing from a significant body of research (eg. Black & Wiliam, 1998, Hattie & Timperley, 2007; Wiggins, 2012) as a  staff, we recognize that in order for feedback to be truly authentic, collaborative and actionable, opportunities must  be provided and particular skills must be taught, so that students have the underpinnings necessary to participate  fully.    In particular Hattie cites effective feedback as one of the most powerful drivers in student learning (effect size= .7)  and Wiliam notes the potential of well-crafted feedback to double the pace of learning.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?     As a school community, we have looked at various data sources. As per the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, 98% of  teachers say that students behave well in class even when the teacher isn’t watching. The same percentage report  that they have access to school based supports to assist in behavioral and emotional escalations.       Internal behavioral reports as well as OORS reports reflect a fewer number of students being identified as the  “suspect”. This year, 13 students have an OORS report – 2.6% of students. Last year, and the year before that, 3.5% of  students had an OORS report.       Internal student surveys show that 96% of students reported talking about the PS9 Core Values in the classroom, but  only 40% report talking about the values at home with their families. 82% of students report that the schools focus on  the core values makes kids think about their own relationships and behaviors.       During the school wide planning retreat, staff and parents discussed ways in which we could align the work in the  building and the home lives of the students. We looked at the newly released Social Emotional Learning Standards.  The decision was made to work together, as a community, inclusive of parents, teachers and students, to review the  new standards and then to work together to align the current PS9 SEL Curriculum with the new SEL Standards.       Including students and parents in the alignment, will, increase the overall community awareness of the Core Values.  Including the multiple perspective will broaden the scope and maximize the commitment.    Other existing factors:     As a school, we have adopted the "Positive Discipline" model. Class meetings are held regularly as are school   wide assemblies around character education.      During the 2017-2018 school year we invited Dr. Ross Greene to conduct a professional development session   with teachers from around the district and to hold a meeting with parents    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          18           PA meetings have included presentations by administration around "Positive Discipline", the Integrated Co-  teaching (ICT) model and the Workshop Model as well as a session around the Common Core. Teachers have  also presented content and enrichment curriculum.      We are committed to further developing social emotional intelligence by creating a school-wide culture   where all students feel supported, respected and have a sense of accomplishment.      We are committed to ensuring that student engagement continue to be a highlight of the PS9 community.      Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June of 2019, we will have aligned the PS9 Social Emotional Curriculum with the NYS Social Emotional Benchmarks.  Students and staff and parents will collaborate to fully integrate the two as measured by attendance and minutes as  well as the final publication of the PS9 SEL Handbook.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.      STRENGTHS:   Based on the 17-18 School Quality Guide:     100% of teachers responded positively to questions about Collaborative Teachers.     98% of teachers say that teachers are actively trying to improve their teaching.    95% of teachers say that teachers take responsibility for improving the school.     98% of teachers say that they are eager to try new ideas.    100% of teachers, principals, and staff collaborate to make the school run effectively.    Other existing factors:   Distributive Leadership      In June of 2018, 78% of teachers attended an after school event designed to create CEP goals and participated  in discussions led by members of our Coherency Team.      During the 2017-2018 school year, 90% of teachers took on a leadership role; facilitating book clubs,   presenting to the PA, sitting on Coherency Team, etc.      During the 2017-2018 school year, the Professional Development committee met regularly to plan the   professional development.     As part of our “inter-visitation” program, "Point" people for each of the areas of "Best Practice" were   identified.     The Coherency Team met 1-2 times each month to monitor and revise the CEP which is inclusive of   professional development plans and goals.   Professional Learning      Several teachers offered to provide professional development sessions over the course of the year; around  technology and planning the integration of technology into existing curriculum, around the Socratic Seminar,  and Math Discourse and differentiation, for example.     Grade levels digitally share their weekly/monthly plans, within grades and with out of classroom teachers and   providers, streamlining collaboration. Common grade planning occur weekly if not more.     Cross-grade team meetings each quarter   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23        100% of the teaching staff has participated in the inter-visitation program    The inter-visitation program within the building has become one of the PS9 hallmarks. It is not, however, without  challenges. Scheduling and consistency when it comes to feedback, next steps and support. Teachers expressed a  strong interest in developing a deeper model of inter-visitation, one which streamlines the various activities and  deepens relationships across the grades.       In our teacher-led "retreat" at the end of the 2017-2018 school year, teachers identified the need to streamline the  work being done. By creating “teams” of teachers, and utilizing common planning time as well as Monday afternoon  PD time, these Collaborative Teacher Teams (CTT) will have increased flexibility to conduct inter-visitations, meet  together, align curriculum, conduct “book talks” and provide critical feedback to one another.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.  By June 2019, all teachers will participate in a “collaborative teacher team” (CTT), consisting of one teacher from each  grade level, and out of classroom staff resulting in 50% of teachers reporting an increase in collective self-efficacy as  evidences by a pre/post survey.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          24     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Our “Theory of Action” states that, “If we devote resources and time to developing the capacity of our teacher leaders  to facilitate ongoing instructional improvement, then the focus of our teachers' regular work together will be  grounded in improving learning experiences for all students. If we continually develop the instructional expertise of  our teachers, then teaching will be strengthened and all students will learn in deeper and more meaningful ways."

The School Quality Guide for 2017-2018 reveals that within the community of teachers and parents, there was a 98%  positive response to questions around outreach to parents and the same for parent involvement in the school.       PS9 has a rich history of community involvement activities. We have several community events throughout the year;  Halloween Hop, Movie Nights, Groovy Night, Gallery Night, publishing parties - all of which are very well attended. We  have 95% parent attendance at Parent/Teacher conferences. We have also instituted brief morning sessions for  parents to come into the classroom a couple of times a year.       One of our most successful and well attended events is the annual Gallery Night. On this evening, every student in the  school has a piece of art work displayed. We have fourth grade “docents” who guide the visitors through the  “museum”. The community then works together to create, collaboratively, sculptures, which are displayed in front of  the building.       The SLT survey indicated that parents wanted more activities like the Gallery Night, where they could interact with  their students, in the school. We know that opportunities to involve the whole community, teachers, parents and  students, deepen connections and reinforce community bonds.       Borrowing from the “Gallery Night” model, we discussed having an event which simultaneously highlights student  work, and celebrates the diversity within our school community. The event will culminate with an “International  Feast”, and a performance highlighting one of the cultures present within our community. Students will select a piece  of work, most likely from their Social Studies portfolio, to share at the event.       Having teachers, students and parents all together, celebrating student work, and sharing a meal, will help to ensure  that our community remains strong and will provide an opportunity for relationships to deepen.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          30              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 009 Sarah Anderson , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A  of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.

The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Currently, 7% of our ELL/MLL students are at the entering level. 20% are at the emerging level, 0% are at the transitioning  level, 73% are at the expanding level. We also have seven students at the commanding level (receiving services as per CR 154).  Generally, our students do best in the speaking and listening modalities. As a result, we use the speaking and listening  modalities to build our students' capacity in reading and writing and focus much of our direct instruction on reading and  writing. In order to guide instructional planning and provide actionable feedback for our ELLs/MLLs, we use teacher-created  assessments that are based on the grade-level standards and curriculum for reading, writing, math, science, and social studies.  Classroom teachers and the ENL teacher utilize the New Language Arts Progressions (NLAP) to guide their expectations of each  individual student based on their current proficiency level (using NYSESLAT or NYSITELL data). Teacher-created formative  assessments include all four modalities; we check for understanding in listening, speaking, reading and writing. These informal  assessments include but are not limited to teacher observations (responses to strategic questioning, verbal and nonverbal  participation in discussions) and analyzing student work (graphic organizers, exit tickets, peer assessments, self assessments).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      Teachers track their observations via lesson-specific or unit-specific checklists. Teachers analyze student work using checklists  and rubrics that have been created in collaboration with the students.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teacher collaboration is the key structure that supports our formative assessment methods. Grade-level teachers have at least  one common planning period together during the school day once a week. In addition, we utilize the extended time on  Monday for professional development to periodically plan, revise, and differentiate units on cross-grade curriculum-based  teams. During this time in September, the ENL teacher disseminates and interprets NYSESLAT results. For the remainder of the  school year, the ENL teacher provides regular guidance to all teachers who work with ELLs/MLLs on how to utilize the NLAP  and modify instruction to best meet the needs of our students. Many teachers have decided to plan their lessons digitally and  share these with their colleagues in order to optimize collaboration.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  All students are assessed three times a year using the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System. These running  records help teachers determine both the independent and instructional reading levels and track growth over time. These  reading assessments ensure that our students have both accuracy and comprehension. Teachers also look closely at reading  fluency and error and self-correction patterns. In addition, all students are assessed three times a year in writing and math.  These formal assessments are standards-based and are designed by each grade's teacher team to measure skills that have  already been taught during the current school year. In writing, these tasks are typically one to two days long and are assessed  via the school's writing rubric for ideas, organization, voice, word choice, sentence fluency, and conventions. In math, these  tasks are focused on problem solving and are assessed via the school's mathematical practice rubric.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once summative data has been gathered in the fall, winter, and spring, it is shared via Google Drive with all teachers. The data  is used create targeted groups for guided reading, guided writing, and skill-based groups in the other content areas. These  groupings are flexible and change over time with the needs of the students. Additionally, we use the Orton Gillingham (OG)  approach to support students who are not making progress in reading and writing. The ENL teacher, intervention teacher, and  all classroom teachers in grades K-2 have the IMSE Comprehensive Orton-Gillingham Certification. We use small-group  instruction to support struggling students with OG strategies, which incorporate visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning.  While these multi-sensory strategies are effective for all students, they are especially helpful for ELLs/MLLs.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The PS 9 professional learning community conducts regular meetings around RTI with the principal, assistant principal,  guidance counselor, and school based support team to facilitate and guide the creation of lessons that give entry points for all  students with differentiated needs (ELLs, SWDs, gifted learners, etc.). In addition, there are grade-level meetings weekly where  teachers work as a team to analyze assessments and data. This conversation and collaboration helps teachers identify needs  and plan instruction to meet these needs. We use the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) to analyze student achievement and  identify at-risk students. The EDAT allows us to focus on sub-groups and monitor student achievement over time. In addition,  we use our reading, writing, and math summative assessment data to identify students who require intensive targeted  instruction. Teachers and administration meet regularly to collaboratively analyze this data and then monitor the effectiveness  of our targeted instruction.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSESLAT is used to evaluate and inform the ELL program in grades K-2. Beginning in grade 3, we also use ELA test results  and math test results to evaluate and inform our ELL program. For newcomers in all grades, NYSITELL data is compared to the  NYSESLAT data to measure growth within the same school year.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, ELA, and math test results are disseminated, discussed, and analyzed every fall in a meetings with  administration and teachers. We make adjustments to the ENL program every fall based on this data analysis. We also revise  the program when and if there have been any changes to the NYSESLAT Targets of Measurement and standards.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   PS 9 currently provides instruction via the Freestanding English as a New Language program. These students are  grouped based on their grade level (heterogeneously), but instructional time is designed around their proficiency  levels. All entering and emerging students receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week. For entering students,  180 minutes of this time is designated for stand-alone ENL instruction. For emerging students, 90-180 minutes of this  time is designated for stand-alone ENL instruction. During stand-alone ENL time, entering and emerging students are  pulled-out of their classroom to receive targeted English instruction to help provide the learning strategies to be  successful in the monolingual classroom. For the remainder of this time, entering and emerging students receive  integrated ENL, where the ENL teacher, who is dually certified, provides ENL or ELA instruction. Transitioning and  expanding students receive 180 minutes of ENL, ELA, or other core content area instruction per week. Whenever  possible, the ENL teacher pushes-in to the classroom to provide integrated instruction. The integrated model, where  the teacher works in collaboration with the classroom teacher(s) in a team teaching effort, is the chosen model of PS  9. For the purposes of scheduling and planning, our ELL students are grouped into one classroom per grade whenever  possible. When there are ELLs from multiple classes on the grade, the ENL teacher, who is dually certified, pulls the  students out of the classroom and works to support the students in meeting grade-level standards and with units  from the collaborative grade curriculum maps. When there are new arrivals in contiguous grade levels, homogeneous  groups of this beginning proficiency level are set up across the grades. For example, a first and second grade  beginning level group would be set up to meet the needs of new-arrival ELLs.         b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   To ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels, all stakeholders on the  LAP team are aware of the amount of time required for each proficiency level. Scheduling is prepared and discussed with the  principal and the assistant principal and posted. In order to maximize English language acquisition for ELLs/MLLs, the ENL  teacher and the classroom teachers work together closely to deliver literacy instruction as well as tailor additional content  instruction to meet the needs of our ELLs. By using a combination of standalone periods and integrated instruction, all ELLs at  the entering and emerging level receive 360 minutes per week of instruction from the dually certified ENL teacher with a  minimum of 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 integrated ENL/ELA. For the transitioning level, they receive 90 minutes  of integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL (with ELA or any other content area). The expanding  level students receive 180 minutes of ENL/ELA or other content area instruction. Finally, the commanding students receive 90   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      integrated minutes of ENL/ELA or other content area instruction from the dually certified ENL teacher. These services are  planned in conjunction with the classroom teacher(s) when the integrated model is used to meet the required time as  regulated by CR Part 154.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Core content is presented in English using the SIOP model to support and/or scaffold the content areas. Assessing prior  knowledge, making graphic organizers, using visual images and videos, doing hands-on activities, as well as modeling by the  teacher, are just some of the strategies used to make the content more comprehensible. In addition, the content area teachers  and the ENL teacher plan together to identify and pre-teach the academic language that is involved in each area. Depending  on the proficiency level of the child, we address Tier 1 (basic vocabulary), Tier 2 (high-frequency academic vocabulary), and  Tier 3 (domain specific vocabulary). Vocabulary instruction is explicit and students are given a chance to use these words in  reading, writing, and speaking. Multilevel source books allow for differentiation of material and provide extra support for  beginning and intermediate literacy level ELLs/MLLs. In order to ensure that explicit ELA instruction is delivered, the ENL  teacher includes literature and content-based instruction aligned with the New York State learning standards. Whenever  possible, the ENL teacher works to support the literacy block in the mainstream classroom. During stand-alone ENL time,  instruction is designed around the anchor standards and individual student needs since these students are often in two  contiguous grades. Direct literacy instruction is focused around non-fiction texts whenever possible and appropriate to the  standards.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   We informally assess progress in the home language via parent and student partnerships. In parent partnerships, the ENL  teacher meets with parents/guardians to share and explain the Home Language Arts Progressions (HLAP). Using  parent/guardian input, an informal proficiency level is determined for the home language. As each anchor standard is  addressed with the ENL teacher (one per month), the relevant HLAP is shared with the child's parent/guardian so that he/she  can monitor the child's progress in the home language. In student partnerships (when applicable) students are paired with  another student who speaks the same home language. At the end of the week, students are given the opportunity to  demonstrate proficiency in the home language with their partner via reading and discussing a book or by explaining concepts  that have been taught during the week. Progress with the new and home language is discussed during parent-teacher  conferences twice a year.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE: At this time, we do not have any SIFE students. Generally, we begin differentiating with this subgroup by meeting with  the family and administering a native language assessment if possible. This data helps us assess the child's strengths,  weaknesses, and interests as well as anticipate any social-emotional needs the child may have. Working as a team with the  guidance counselor, ENL teacher, principal, and assistant principal allows us to make a collective plan to move SIFE students  from one academic level to the next academic level.  b. Newcomers (0-3 years): PS 9 received newcomers from Dominican Republic, Mexico, Spain, Russia, China, Turkey,  Bangladesh, Honduras, France, Canada, and Israel and in the last few years. For students at the entering and emerging levels,  services were provided in two ways. They were grouped with their grade level peers (heterogeneously) as well as with other  students at the same proficiency level in contiguous grades (homogeneously). This allowed the ENL teacher to build the skills  that were below grade level and at the same time, begin to expose the students to curriculum standards on their grade. The  lessons for newcomers always include the four modalities: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Bilingual glossaries were  provided for the students to address vocabulary specific to the content areas including ELA, math, science, social studies, and  science.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      c. Developing (4-6 years): We are continually monitoring the progress of all our ELLs in need of extension of service. Through  meetings with the classroom teacher, the ENL teacher, and other service providers, we can study the results of the NYSESLAT  as well as ELA and math tests to identify the areas of need. Lessons are designed to meet the standards while there is  differentiated instruction to meet student goals. When needed, intervention with extra services such as the morning program  for reading and writing is employed. As part or our RTI initiative, the staff is currently using RTI From All Sides by Mary Howard  as a base to expand our program for at-risk students. The program calls for the use of differentiated instruction, targeted  intense support, and continuous monitoring to drive instruction to ensure success.  d. Long-term ELLs (7 or more years): By continually monitoring the progress of all ELL students, we are aware of the needs of  our students, especially those students who have received ENL services in the school system for seven years or more. As an  elementary school, we do not typically have any long term ELLs/MLLs, but if we did, we would set up regular meetings with the  classroom teacher, the ENL teacher, and other service providers to identify the area(s) of need. When needed, intervention  with extra services such as the Title III extension program for reading and writing can be provided.  e. Former ELLs: By continually monitoring the progress of our ELL/MLL students, both current and former, we are aware of the  transitioning needs of our students who have tested proficient on the NYSESLAT. For at least two years following the school  year in which a student is exited from ELL status, former ELLs will receive at least 90 minutes of integrated ENL support or  small group instruction per week. These students are also eligible for certain testing accommodations. In addition, these  students can be invited to the Title III after school/before school enrichment program.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELL-SWDs use instructional strategies such as modeling, bridging, schema building, and metacognitive  development. Teachers are also using the Rigby Reading Strategies Toolkit, which provides reading instruction cards with a  visual cue as well as written instruction for the teacher to model and for the students to practice. In addition, the Harvey  Goudvis Comprehension Toolkit provides modeled lessons for metacognitive development: thinking while reading. Teachers of  ELL-SWDs also break down the information to be taught into sections, while making use of graphic organizers so that they can  comprehend the grade-level materials. In the area of mathematics, instructional activities like "Number Talks" have been  found to meet the needs of these students. In addition, to address the growing need to write and explain answers in  mathematics, the PS 9 staff is using the Exemplar's program and Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI). In ELA units of study  (often integrated with social studies), differentiated materials are provided according to ELL proficiency.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  One example of using curricular and instruction flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least  restrictive environment is the ICT program. Currently, we have at least one ICT class in every grade from K to 5. This type of  programming allows the general education teacher, the special education teacher, and the ENL teacher to meet the diverse  needs of the ELL-SWDs in these grades. All of our ELL-SWDs are placed in the least restrictive environment and spend all school  periods with non-disabled peers. Planning together to teach English Language Arts with the ICT class teachers, the ENL teacher  can use ENL and ELA methodology to work with these students. All of the instruction is aligned with the NYS ELA learning  standards.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  All of the intervention services currently offered at PS 9 are in English. The targeted intervention programs for ELLs/MLLs in  ELA and math include RTI and extended-day programs. The targeted area of need is identified and met through RTI for  ELLs/MLLs at risk of not attaining one year's value added growth. In addition to receiving strategic instruction in small groups  by the classroom teacher, these students receive additional instruction from the ENL teacher either in a standalone or  integrated program. Tier 3 students along with some Tier 2 students receive additional support from a literacy specialist. When  PS 9 receives Title III funding, additional reading support is available to students in grades 1-2 before or after school. Extra  practice in math and literacy for students in grades 3-5 is available during the spring Saturday Academy. We ensure all students  receive the appropriate testing accommodations for ELLs/MLLs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      PS 9 will continue to promote metacognitive reading strategies. Teachers will continue to be trained in these scaffolding  measures in particular with the Harvey and Goudvis Comprehension Toolkit (a program to teach strategies explicitly for  reading non-fiction). In order to build academic discourse, beginning this year, the ENL teacher will use a program called  Discussions 4 Learning.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  PS 9 provides a mixture of integrated and differentiated curriculum that is strongly enriched with instruction in art, music,  technology, and foreign language. This rich curriculum promotes high academic achievement with a challenging content for all  students. All students including ENL students are engaged in the visual arts beginning in kindergarten through grade five. The  school has partnerships with several museums, which are visited and incorporated into the units of study as well as into prep  periods (technology, physical education, music, art, Spanish). In addition, ENL students in the early grades receive instruction in  ORFF methodology, which is inclusive of a choral, instrumental, and movement study. ENL students in grades three to five  begin a study of instrumental music that starts with a recorder program and graduates to the study of a particular instrument.  The teachers have partnered with groups such as the NYC Ballet and Carnegie Hall. This includes field trips to observe  professional musicians and dancers practicing their craft. Additionally, several ENL students have received scholarships  through the PA to attend the private after school program that is run in our building. They receive homework help as well as a  choice of activity such as sports, cooking, drama, etc. Through Title III funding, ENL students in grades 1-5 are also offered an  early morning/afternoon literacy program. The PA has provided funding for DOE teachers to give instruction in Spanish culture  and language during the school day to all classes. Information about these programs is distributed in the parents' language of  choice. We use the Translation and Interpretation Unit to assist us when communicating with families.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials used to support ELLs include big books, guided reading books, and chapter books in a range of ability  level and genre. We use mentor texts when writing and have created curriculum maps for K-5 to ensure that all teachers are  planning together and integrating multiple subject areas whenever possible. Materials are also chosen to meet the cultural  interests of the students in our program. Books that reflect the language and culture of the ELLs/MLLs at PS 9 are kept in a  special section of the school library. In addition, there are books kept in the classrooms that reflect the culture and background  of any newcomer ELLs/MLLs. The technology teacher at PS 9 has planned lessons aligned with the NYS learning standards to  show students, including ELLs/MLLs, in grades 3-5 how to take notes, organize information, and outline and research  information for their content areas/literacy lessons. Our most helpful technological tools are the ELMO and interactive  whiteboards found in every classroom, which can be used, for example, to support students as they learn to give and receive  peer feedback. Teachers use these tools to scaffold and provide visual support for instruction in all content areas for all  subgroups including newcomer ELLs, developing ELLs, long-term ELLs, SIFE, ELLs with disabilities, and former ELLs.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We do not currently have a DL or TBE program. The ENL students are provided with translation guides when needed and age- appropriate. For example, a Chinese-English translation of common math terms was provided to a fifth grader last year to  support his acquisition of English, by building off of the home language. The ENL teacher is bilingual in Spanish, and periodically  provides home language support to entering level students as needed if non-verbal communication, realia, and modified rate  of speech are ineffective. The ENL teacher attempts to make overt connections to children's home languages in every lesson to  aid in language acquisition. The HLAP are shared with families on a monthly basis as the ENL teacher moves from one anchor  standard to another. This is intended as a method to support families as they continue to practice and develop the home  language. Progress with both English and the home language is discussed at least twice a year during parent-teacher  conferences.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The ELLs/MLLs at PS 9 are provided with appropriate support services so that every child can achieve and maintain a  satisfactory level of academic performance. These services include individual counseling, home visits, and parental counseling  by the guidance counselor when needed. When applicable, before and after school Title III literacy services are provide to all  ELL/MLL students. In addition, the needs of any at-risk ELL may be met through RTI during the school day. ENL students  receiving special education services in accordance with his/her IEP are also eligible for ENL services as recommended by their  IEP. All required services and resources correspond to the age and grade level of the ELLs. We have purchased high interest,  low level books to support the ELL/MLL students in the upper grades and have a library of native language books available in  the ENL classroom as well as the school library.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    PS 9 shares a building with MS 243: The Center School. MS 243 does not currently have any ENL students so they do not have  an ENL teacher. On occasion when they receive a new student who may require ENL services, they utilize the PS 9 ENL teacher  to administer the NYSITELL, compose entitlement/nonentitlement letters, administer the NYSESLAT, and provide instruction.  PS 9 and MS 243 have coordinated so that these services are provided before and/or after the PS 9 school day, but during the  MS 243 school day.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   In order to assist newly enrolled ELL students prior to the first day of school, PS 9 invites all students to tour the prospective  class with their parents. In kindergarten, all new students spend one hour in the kindergarten classroom with the current  kindergarten teachers simulating what their kindergarten day will be like in September. The current kindergarten students are  out of the room and involved in another activity during this time. Parents then have an opportunity to meet and talk with one  another in the auditorium. Our bilingual Parent Coordinator is able to make the Spanish-speaking parents feel welcome and is  able to answer their questions. When available, parents who speak other languages become a buddy parent to help the new  family. In addition, the PA holds special picnics for the families of the incoming students on all grade levels so that the new  students have an opportunity to meet with their classmates as well as socialize with the other students from the PS 9  community. For students who enroll during the school year, we make every attempt to find a buddy parent who speaks the  same language as the new family. Last year, a new student from Israel was welcomed at a small gathering of all the students in  the school that spoke Hebrew. She was thrilled to meet these other students because there was no one on her grade level that  spoke the language. A letter was sent home to the parents making them aware of the new arrival in our school thus connecting  both student and parents. All information for new parents is given in the language of choice.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    There is an enrichment Spanish exposure program for grades K-5. These teachers see every class once a week in order to  expose students to the Spanish language and associated cultures through games, songs, and activities. In grades 2-5, Spanish  instruction is linked to the social studies curriculum.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The professional development plan includes teachers, principals, and guidance counselors who work with ELLs. A minimum of  six sessions are conducted annually. Two sessions focus on the New Language Arts Progressions. Two sessions focus on the Six  Traits of Writing and how it applies to ELLs/MLLs. Two sessions focus on the SIOP model.  All teachers have received Orton Gillingham training to help struggling readers and have been trained to use Number Talks,  which includes math discourse or Talk Moves. These strategies are ideal for ELLs/MLLs because they provide students with an  opportunity to revoice and repeat information provided in the lesson. Teachers have been working on tiering grade level unit  plans for their ELLs and students with disabilities in mind. The ENL teacher meets individually with the school secretary and  parent coordinator to share new resources and to turnkey protocols for admission. In the fall, there will be an opportunity to  discuss and analyze NYSESLAT scores as well as their instructional implications. This information will provide insights into  individual strengths and weaknesses to classroom teachers and support staff. There will be other PD opportunities that will be  needs-based and determined by the staff.  Workshops are made available for the ENL teacher through the DOE's MFSC. For example, this year at the ELL Startup Meeting  over the summer, the MFSC staff leading the meeting shared new compliance regulations, support on how to write a strong  and meaningful LAP, and time to plan for the upcoming school year using the NLAP.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Although it is not CTLE approved, we provide a minimum of 15 hours of ELL-specific professional development to all staff  during the Monday extended day time. The ENL teacher creates an agenda for every meeting and maintains all attendance  records. The ENL teacher attends all of the MFSC professional development hours that are offered both during the school year  as well as over the summer.  In order to meet the minimum 50 hours of ELL-specific professional development to ENL teachers, workshops are made  available for the ENL teacher through the DOE's MFSC. For example, this year at the ELL Startup Meeting over the summer,  the MFSC staff leading the meeting shared new compliance regulations, support on how to write a strong and meaningful LAP,  and time to plan for the upcoming school year using the NLAP.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL teacher will conduct regular parent meetings throughout the school year. Many of these meetings will be conducted  during the Parent Engagement time on Tuesday afternoons, either in person or over the phone. In addition, the ENL teacher  will conduct quarterly parent meetings for the families of all ELLs to help provide information and strategies for supporting  their children at home. The ENL teacher is bilingual in Spanish. As needed, the parent meetings may utilize the support of the  Interpretation and Translation Unit. Parent meetings may be initiated by the ENL teacher via an email, a note home, or a  phone call. Parents of ELLs can also request a meeting via an email, a note to the teacher, or a phone call to the main office.  During these meetings, the parents and ENL teacher discuss the goals of the program, language development progress,  language proficiency assessment results (NYSITELL or NYSESLAT), and language development needs in all content areas.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   In addition to the parent orientation meeting for all new ELL families (conducted within 10 days of enrollment), there are  meetings for parents of ELLs throughout the school year. The purpose is to present information on methods and materials   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         used in the ELL program as well as to teach parents effective strategies for language learning that can be utilized in the home.  NYS standards and assessments are discussed. There is also an informational meeting held in April to explain the NYSESLAT. At  all meetings, the ENL teacher is assisted by the parent coordinator who works with the ENL teacher to orient the parents who  are new to the school. Arrangements are made to ensure translators are available at all meetings when necessary. In the fall,  the ENL teacher shares the parents' preferred languages with all staff and updates a list of languages that our staff can speak,  read, and write. In this way, materials are available in the preferred language in a timely manner. The parent coordinator  translates important information into Spanish, follows up with new families who may be hard to reach, and attends all PA  meetings with the goal of increased participation of ELL parents in mind. The staff works together to make sure that new  parents and/or parents that speak another language feel welcome and comfortable in our school.     Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Katherine Witze, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Sarah Anderson                                                                              School DBN: 03M009  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We begin to assess language preference data via the HLIS. The initial interview of parents and students is  conducted by the ENL teacher during the registration process. The child's dominant home language is entered into  ATS along with the parent's preferred language for oral and written communication. The ENL teacher may also  share her informal observations of the family's English language proficiency with the child's teacher. In  September, an Adult Preferred Language report (RAPL) is run to ensure that school staff are communicating with  families in the preferred language. This data is shared with teachers at the first staff meeting via a report that the  ENL teacher updates regularly. The report is sorted by grade and class. All staff have been surveyed to assess the  languages in which they are literate. This list is disseminated to the administration, main office staff, parent  coordinator, and teachers in case a translation or interpretation need is urgent and/or unscheduled.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65     2.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      The school's administration and LAC review CR A663 with staff annually during the September professional  development time. The LAC reviews the specific language needs of the community and surveys the staff to assess the  languages in which they are literate. The LAC reviews how confidential student information must be handled and  reviews the budget for translation and interpretation and how these funds are typically utilized. The LAC also reviews  how to use Language Line.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68     Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      We will post the LTI sign in the main entrance of the building, which advertises the availability of interpretation  services as well as the name and contact information for the school's LAC. Additionally, we utilize all of the translated  documents that are available on the intranet. The language needs of our community have been shared with the  parent association. As a result, parent volunteers are available for parent engagement events.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       After each instance when we utilize language translation and interpretation services, the LAC orally surveys the  relevant families (utilizing school staff or community volunteers) to assess the effectiveness and quality of the  language services. Three times a year, the LAC reinforces the availability of language translation and interpretation  services with both staff and families. Whenever possible, this feedback is shared with our Field Access Coordinator,  Francis Urroz.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69
