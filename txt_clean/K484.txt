This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At Ronald Edmonds Learning Center II we provide a strong foundation that empowers students to be socially aware,  emotionally strong and excel academically through high expectations, rigorous instruction, culturally responsive  pedagogy and partnerships with families and the community to become tomorrow’s leaders prepared to succeed and  compete according to their college interest and professional aspirations.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Ronald Edmonds Learning Center II is located on the border of Ocean Hill Brownsville, Bedsty and Crown Heights. This  school was created in 2005. Our school is a Culturally Responsive Pedagogy. Culturally Responsive Pedagogy is a  student-centered approach to teaching in which the unique cultural strengths of students are identified and nurtured  to promote student achievement and a sense of well-being in the world.    At Ronald Edmonds Learning Center II, we practice Culturally Responsive Education. This practice began three years  ago with the New York University Tactical Assistance Center for Disproportionality. After we noticed the success, we  deepened the work using literature from Gloria Ladson-Billings, Raymond Terrell, and Lindsey. These practices  allowed us to become a Culturally Responsive Environment. We continue to evolve as a Culturally Responsive  Environment.   At Ronald Edmonds Learning Center II we keep the child and their family at the center of everything we do. We are a  school that believes in understanding the needs of the individual child and creating a plan that will ensure that the  academic, social and emotional needs of the child are addressed. Our staff goes above and beyond for our students  creating a Family setting. This type of environment is necessary for middle school students who are to beginning to  experience hormonal changes and need to feel a sense of belonging that is deepened through our HOUSE model and  the Libation ritual.    The goal of our house model is to create community, strengthen relationships, celebrate our diverse cultures, and  foster ethnic pride while teaching tolerance and enhancing our school environment. Our entire school community is  divided into teams, which are named after exemplary leaders and humanitarians and reflect the ethnicity of our  students. Houses meet regularly and work together to achieve individual and collective success, encourage  engagement, and promote school spirit through wholesome competition.    The Ronald Edmonds Learning Center II believe in community involvement. Our students, plant a garden that is  supervised by the Principal, visit the community centers in the area and provide them cheer. Our school has many  extracurricular activities, such as needlework (sewing), sports, SASF, NOBLE, Junior Achievement, Classroom INC and  Urban Advantage to name a few. Most parents who visit our school enroll their child.    We are a small school and have challenges than larger and better-financed schools don’t have. These situations are  what make us a stronger and closer community. The Principal teaches classes which allows her to get to know  students well and informs her work with teachers when developing the curriculum. Nearly all of our teachers  contribute their time to teach enrichment classes.    We have several clubs that we invite all students to be a part of; such as sewing, Boyz to Men, a Principal’s book club,  tutoring, lunchtime games, weekend Science trips and college trips. We have also developed partnerships with  outside organizations such as Urban Advantage, the Police Leadership Program, Champs (basketball and volleyball  and the Sports and Arts In-School Foundation After-school and TRIAD, to provide our students with additional  opportunities.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   At Ronald Edmonds Learning Center II we have the following special populations: Learning Disabled, Emotional  Disabled, speech and language impaired, students functioning below grade level but not identified prior and students  who are functioning above grade level.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      While the majority of our students are not yet performing at grade level Standards Levels on the Math and E.L.A state  tests, we made remarkable progress in the past year, and in fact, exceeded the targets that the city had set for us in  E.L.A. 80% of our students made at least one year’s progress in E.L.A, as compared to the city average 63.4%. 70% of  our students made a year’s progress in Math (city average 61.3%). And for our students who had scored in the lowest  third in prior years, our students progressed by 87% in Math and E.L.A as compared to the city wide averages of 73%  and 76.7%. We are working hard to close the achievement gap for our students. This progress is due in large part to  the new curriculum we have adopted, to the greater emphasis that we are placing on training teachers, and to the  implementation of the Danielson Framework. We are pleased that our students are making progress but we would  like our students to be proficient at graduation to this end we have decided to incorporate the teachers college  curriculum into our E.L.A classrooms and use 'Jump Math' a curriculum that has data demonstrating success with  similar student populations.   We have also exceeded expectations set by the city regarding the environment and culture of the school. Ninety  seven percent of our school community feels that the school is on the right path towards providing an engaging and  rigorous curriculum. Ninety eight percent of our school community feels that structures are in place for improving the  school. Ninety seven percent of our community feels safe and comfortable with the school’s culture.   Despite these gains, we have only just begun to make significant changes in the school. Our focus for this year is  improving instruction to students by focusing on refinement of curricula to include writing across all subject areas,  and on developing pedagogical strategies that engage students in their own learning. Every classroom at R.E.L.C II has  a Smart Board, and we now have computers for all students. We are presently developing engaging strategies for  students using the available technology.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 17K484   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   159   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Strengths:     Teachers at Ronald Edmonds Learning Center II, have mastered the art of culminating assessment of the   lesson or unit, they are also able to assess students at the beginning of the lesson.      Teachers provide common core curriculum aligned lesson in a nurturing environment.    Administrators collaborate and provide support for teachers to be able to deliver rigorous instruction to   scholars.     Based on 2017- 2018 walk through the school leaders and teachers effectively align curricula to Common Core  Learning Standards and ensure the integration of the instructional shifts school-wide, teachers utilize student  work and data to plan and refine curricula and academic tasks.      There was an increase in the number of eight grade students who are proficient in mathematics but they   graduated.   Needs:   Based on the 2018 New York State Mathematics Exams rising     5 % of 8th graders are on or above grade level    11% of 7th graders are on or above grade level     3 % of 6th graders are on or above grade level   Based on the assessment done students are missing foundational skills in mathematics and therefore students need  to be taught math at a slower more in- depth pace. Additionally assessments must be looped to ensure students  remember content previously taught. We are also including our social emotional learning and culturally responsive  content to remove the mental barriers that students have to mathematics and stimulate recollection.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

(Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   122,648.00     0    0    0    1,079,751.00       1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 17K484, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       [Ronald Edmonds Learning Center II] will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their children’s academic  achievement, such as literacy training, and using technology, as appropriate, to foster parental involvement,  through evening programs and workshops during the school day ;   ● Fostering a caring and effective home- school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress through the use of School messenger, Remind App, phone calls, and mail;    ● Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and  decision making in support of the education of their children;    ● Providing assistance to parents in understanding city, state and federal standards and assessments;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      ● Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities. This information  will be provided in a format and language that parents can understand;    ● Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of our school community;    The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?   The formative assessment and curriculum-embedded being used to guide instructional planning for our ELLs include  NYSESLAT; Degrees of Reading Power (DRP), Engage New York Curriculum and Assessments, Ready New York Assessments,  Making Thinking Visible Strategies, and Teacher-Created Assessments, including quizzes,unit tests, and Exit Tickets.  For some  Spanish speaking students who have not yet acquired enough English to use traditional materials, some instruction and  assessments are administered in Spanish and supplemented with assistance from Spanish speaking teachers.        The data gathered from these assessments enable us to identify our  ELLs' areas of strengths and opportunities for growth,  their levels of competence in skills based on the Common Core Learning Standards, as well as their independent and  instructional reading levels.   Subsequently, students are grouped so that they can receive targeted instruction and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         individualized support. Additionally,  teachers use data from ongoing formative assessments to guide their instructional  planning; re-teaching and employing different strategies as necessary.          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Several structures are in place to support analysis of data from formative assessments and the subsequent use of this data  for  instructional planning.  Teachers meet regularly on grade levels and by content areas to delve into the data and determine  how best to serve our ELLs.  Teachers collaborate to determine the best ways to meet the instructional needs of each student  terms of both content, skills, and methodology.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Summative assessments that are used to identify baseline, progress, and areas of need include Degrees of Reading Power  (DRP), which is administered in the fall semester to determine students' reading levels and again in the spring semester to  measure shifts in students' reading levels, the Measurement of Student Learning (MOSL), which is administered as a baseline  assessment at the start of the fall semester and at the end of the year to measure growth; Engage New York end of unit  assessments and Ready New York Rest Ready assessments, both of which measure skills based on the Common Core Learning  Standards.  Data from these assessments are analyzed to determine students' baseline, progress, and areas of need.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Several structures are in place to address interventions once the data from summative  assessments has been gathered.  Based  on this data, students will be assigned to classes that are designed for students performing at or near their level.  Furthermore,  within each class, there is flexible grouping to provide differentiated, targeted instruction based on the data from summative  assessments.  Finally, individualized, one-on-one instruction is provided where necessary.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]                    6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    The outcome assessments data that are used to evaluate and inform our ELL program includes the NYSESLAT, ELA, Math, and  Earth Science Regents Exams and Living Environment.      Across grades, 75% of our ELL students are showing growth in the areas of Listening and Speaking.  However, Reading and  Writing continue to be an area of deficit for our students.  Our new ELL students showed the lowest achievement in the  proficiency levels as they need time to build vocabulary and acquire the language.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   One of the structures that we have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to our program are  school-wide data meetings, in which teachers work in small groups to analyze and chart the data and make  recommendations.  Additionally, teachers look closely at the data during grade level meetings and subject area meetings to  make informed decisions about adjusting teaching methods and curriculum. Another is the visual representation of the data in  our data room, a constant reminder of where students are and what needs to be done to move them academically.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   a. Freestanding ENL program.  a. Instruction in the ENL program is provided through Stand- Alone/Intgrated services. The ENL instructional program  is aligned with mandated ENL/ELA and content area learning standards and the Common Core Standards. Students at  the Entering and Emerging levels in the freestanding ENL program receive 360 minutes of instruction each week,  and students at the Transitioning and Expanding levels receive180 minutes of instruction each week in ENL and ELA.  This explicit ESL instruction is delivered according to CR Part 154. The ENL groups are heterogeneous for targeted area  instruction as informed by the NYSITELL and/or the NYSESLAT. There are two groups of ELL students that receive ENL  services. Group 1 consists of Grade 6 students who are at the Entering, Emerging and Transitioning levels. Group 2 has  students from Grades 7-8 who are at the Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding levels. The schedule of our ENL  teacher is adjusted to the needs of the students so that all ELLs receive the appropriate amount of time needed to  meet the state requirements. The ENL program stresses integration of all four ELA components: listening, speaking,  reading, and writing. The ENL teacher co-teaches in the classrooms during various times of the day, thus ENL is taught  through content areas. During the pull-out classes content-based books are used for ELA and Math instructions. The  needs of all students are met through differentiated instruction. To help the ELL population meet the NYS Learning  Standards, instructional strategies such as small group models, pair work, modeling, author and genre studies, use of  multimedia materials, use of multicultural literature, graphic organizers, and class presentations are utilized.The  school provides ELLs with computers and tablets in the classrooms as well as an access to language- appropriate software that is aligned to standard-based curriculum. The ENL room has leveled books, author and genre  studies, materials, multicultural literature, Spanish library, various Spanish dictionaries, and audio visual  equipment.  additionally, the ENL teacher uses different instructional materials to support students of all levels of  proficiency.   b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?        At the beginning of the school year, the ENL teacher and the administration meet to ensure that all ELLs are receiving  their mandated number of instructional minutes in all our program models. All of our English Language Learners receive the  New York State mandated ENL/ELA instruction time based on students’ proficiency levels. Entering and Emerging ELLs receive  360 minutes of ENL instruction a week. Transitioning and Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction a week.  Students at Commanding level continue to receive 90 minutes per week of ENL support from the ENL teacher for two years  within their classroom setting. Students are grouped according to their proficiency  and grade levels. .        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.    In ENL program model content area is incorporated into ENL instruction. Every reading and writing unit in each grade is  content- area based. Thus, content area instruction and language learning are combined. Our school uses the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      GoMath! program. In this program students receive mathematical instruction that incorporates hands-on activities and  technology. This approach enhances instruction for ELLs. Teachers use strategies that scaffold instruction for English Language  Learners. Some of these strategies  are activating students' prior knowledge, make connections, use visual aides, organizers.  Prior to the lessons ENL teacher will front load information for optimal comprehension. Explicitly teaching key vocabulary from  the text and focusing on concepts and connections is also a main component of ENL instruction. ENL teacher models correct  thinking processes in all subject areas, so that learners become capable to work independently. Our program model  implements differentiated and direct instruction providing research based, standard aligned and data driven ENL lessons that  focus on content area vocabulary development,  grammar and writing across the curriculum.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   N/A     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Based on students' proficiency level, work  performance, and data  in the content area and literacy, students are grouped  according to their instructional needs.      a.  Our SIFE students receive 360 min of the ENL services weekly. For  SIFE students we stress explicit instruction in reading  across the subject area with an emphasis on vocabulary building. This is done in the ENL classroom as well as the content  areas. This is done with daily instruction related to the lessons and reading comprehension, and paragraph and essay  composition strategies via the writing process. Academic intervention is also in place with individualized remedial instruction  in small groups to better prepare them for the NYSESLAT as well as the ELA exam. SIFE students receive academic intervention  services in both reading and math. Additionally, these students are encouraged to participate in all after school and extra  curricular activities.  b. Newcomers receive differentiated instruction as they are grouped on the basis of educational needs.  Those needs are  aggressively targeted and addressed through academic intervention and increased ESL instruction.   c. Plans for long term ELLs include: homework help and after school instruction.  The ENL teacher with collaboration of the  General/Special Education teachers  modify the assignments for them and provide productive work that engages newcomers  in language learning. Newcomers  participate and show comprehension through pointing, nodding, drawing, using actions of  simple responses. When necessary, children participate in AIS for additional small group instruction. We are sensitive to our  newcomers’ emotional needs in adapting to a new culture so we pair beginners with more advanced students who share a  common native language. We use translators as needed, and in particular, where applicable, in testing situations.  c. Our students who are in the Developing subgroup require additional help in reading and writing based on the NYSESLAT  scores:  they receive instruction that focuses on building higher-order thinking skills during mandated ENL periods and in the  classroom.  d. The needs of the students receiving services  are carefully examined. The data is disaggregated to ascertain whether the  issue is based on a language deficit or an instructional deficit. If necessary our IEP teacher provides small group  interventions. All of these students are strongly urged to attend our after-school and Saturday programs.  e. Students who have exited the ENL program will receive mandated ENL service for two full school years. They will receive  90 minutes per week within their classroom setting. The ENL teacher in cooperation with General and /or Special education  teacher is responsible for monitoring these ELLs. Monitoring consists of the following measures of students performance:  report card grades, test scores, student performance, teacher observation, and progress in meeting the NYS Learning  Standards in all areas. The ENL teacher will assist to adopt and modify materials and instructions to the exited students,  thereby facilitating the transition.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELLs with special needs are provided with a plethora of visuals aids and dramatized reading material. Additional instructional  strategies include building academic vocabulary, simplifying content, and concept knowledge to provide access to academic  content and accelerate English language development. Use of technology  to help these students includes Smart Boards,  tablets and computers. The ENL teacher meets with the School Based Support Team and the Assistant Principal and/or the  Principal to make sure ELL-SWDs get the correct ENL services. In some cases, a Bilingual Assistant helps the student in class  throughout the day. The ELL-SWDs use the same materials and do the same work as other students. However, the tasks and  assignments are differentiated based on the student's abilities and on the IEP. Some students may need simplified instruction  using only one or two words while others may need simpler language or have the task broken down into smaller components.  Additionally, teachers use multiple intelligence problem solving strategies  to promote academic success. These   strategies include linguistic, logical-mathematical, bodily-kinesthetic, musicial, interpersonal and naturalistic.   The ESL teacher uses the goals stated in the IEP to address the specific needs of the ELL-SWDs; using such strategies as small  group instruction, multi-sensory materials and graphic organizers for instruction.  All grades implement the Common Core  programs , Gomath! for math, and Engage New York and Ready New York for ELA.   Additionally, all grades utilize the MS 484  curriculum maps to provide instruction in science and social studies.                  7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The instructional strategy that the school utilizes is differentiated instruction based on data as well as the goals stated on the  ELL-SWD IEP. The ESL teacher provides additional comprehensible input to facilitate comprehension and obtain English  proficiency.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our school uses SRA Reading Laboratory, Voyager, Wilson and Fundations programs for literacy intervention. To  support  Independent Reading, we will use 100 Book Challenge which provides books on all levels.  In math, we are using CMP3  Intervention program and in the content area our ESL teacher scaffolds the lessons and identifies tiered words for instruction.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      In our plan,  we will continue to implement Engage New York.  For math, we will also continue to implement GOMath! To  augment our science program, teachers will utilize practicals and labs, to foster a deeper understanding of the content. In  addition, we will continue to promote daily Independent Reading utilizing designated strategic reading periods and Reading  Logs. Student Independent Reading data reveals that 90% of ELLs are not reading or are not read to at home. As such,  we have  adjusted our schedule school-wide to accommodate an extra 45 minutes of Independent Reading every morning using the  Read Daily program. To maximize student support for non readers in this endeavor, all personnel resources including  grandparents, program paraprofessionals and AIS are partnered with an ELL student and reads aloud to them.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We will not discontinue any program this year.         11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Following the Parent Orientation session, the ESL teacher guides all ELL Students to the programs available in our school, and  collaborates with content area teachers  to ensure that ELL students  are provided access to all programs that they are eligible  for.   After school and supplemental programs offered at MS 484 include Sports and Foundation Program which provides academic  enrichment, creative and performing arts, and sports; Broadway Junior, which enables students to produce Broadway shows  modified by Music Theatre International, Brooklyn Arts, and a range of sports teams.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  ELL instructional materials include: Engage New York ELA Curriculum; GoMath! Math Curriculum, including workbooks; Ready  New York ELA and Math Instruction, Practice, and Assessments; independent reading books from classroom  libraries;  illustrated  dictionaries, dual language dictionaries, tablets, laptops, and Smartboards.     We maintain a multilingual library from which fiction and non-fiction books written in English and students' native languages,  (English and Spanish, English and Arabic,  English and Haitian-Creole) for literacy, are utilised by the ESL teacher for each  respective subgroup. This approach facilitates scaffolding literacy instruction and accelerate the English language acquisition.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Our Freestanding ESL program provides educational support in students' native languages by giving newcomers access to our  multilingual library, and by allowing them to temporarily utilize their native language, art, and music to express themselves as  they  engage in gradually building vocabulary in the target language (L-2). Fiction and non-fiction materials are utilized for  support. Textbooks used in all content areas have multi-lingual glossaries and some texts are adapted for ESL students.  Additionally, some ELA core content materials are provided in Spanish.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    At MS 484,  all required services support, and all resources correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels. We match materials to  each of our student groups using materials at various difficulty levels so that all needs can be met. We have materials for  students at the Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding levels of English language proficiency at all ages and grade  levels. We accomplish this by analyzing sources of formal and informal data. We provide instruction that meets students at  their current level of functioning and helps build upon the skills they already possess.  Our Freestanding 'push-in/pull-out' models support students by providing them with small group instruction.  During  instruction,  students are guided to read leveled books and culturally related literature to facilitate language acquisition.  Instruction is aligned with the grade curriculum.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    MS 484 shares a building with PS 12 and work closely to share resources and coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the  ELLs needs are met.  Schools share a multilingual library from which fiction and non-fiction books written in English and  students' native languages, (English and Spanish, English and Arabic,  English and Haitian-Creole) for literacy, are utilised by the  ESL teacher for each respective subgroup. This approach facilitates scaffolding literacy instruction and accelerate the English  language acquisition.   Annual Cultural Awareness Day and similar events to recognize and celebrate ELLs culture and support their socio- emotional needs are jointly hosted and attended by students from both schools.        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELL students are provided with a tour of the school and programs that are available within the school  community.  The students are grouped with other students who share cultural and language background to facilitate their  integration into the NYCDOE school system. These students are also grouped with teachers who can speak their common  language, on staff we have teachers who speak Spanish, Arabic and Haitian Creole.  Parents and students are given a tour of the building, they attend classrooms during Open School Week. They also have the  opportunity to meet with the ENL teacher, support staff, administrators, and parent coordinator to express any concerns or  needs before the child comes into the building. During the first week of the academic school year parents and newly identified  ELLs also participate in our Curriculum Day or Night orientation, which is designed to have parents and students visit their  future classrooms and meet with their classroom teachers to discuss class expectations, curriculum, and initiatives for the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         school year. New ELLs enrolling throughout the school year and their families are invited to participate in activities arranged by  the parent coordinator such as family luncheons, outings, and workshops.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We offer Spanish as a core subject     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?      As per the new mandates: 15% of our staff PD are ELL related and 50% for the ENL teacher.We have one ENL teacher  who attends all available professional development sessions from DOE that are applicable to middle school students.  Our classroom and out-of-classroom teachers demonstrate self-learning and self-motivated professional development by  attending off-site workshops, seminars and conferences related to ELLs. Embedded in all of our professional development are  specific strategies that work for ELL students. When purchasing materials teachers are consulted so as to make sure that all  students have the appropriate materials. ELL training is provided for all staff members during Professional Development days  and Faculty Meetings and cover topics such as Who is an ELL; NYS ELL Identification Process; NYSITELL and NYSESLAT;  Proficiency Levels; Testing and ELLs; Promotion Policy for ELLs; Second Language Acquisition; ESL Strategies; SIFE.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    MS 484 meets the professional development requirements as per Part 154.2 by providing PD to teachers and  administrators that specifically address the needs of ELLs. At least 15% of total PD hours are dedicated to language acquisition,  best practices for co-teaching strategies, integrating language and content instruction for ELLs. The ENL teacher attends PD  meetings provided by the Brooklyn South Field Support Center on a monthly basis. The ENL teacher turnkeys the learning from  the Brooklyn South Field Support Center PDs to school personnel. 50% of the ENL teacher PD hours cover language acquisition  in alignment with core content area instruction as well as best practices for co-teaching strategies, integrating language and  content instruction for ELLs.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56            Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   MS 484 ensures that parents and guardians are provided with a meaningful opportunity to participate in and have access  to programs and services critical to their child's education. Parents of ELLs attend Parent/Teacher Conferences as well as  ELL programs and services critical to their child's education. Parents of ELLs attend Parent/Teacher Conferences as well as  ELL Parent Orientations where parents meet the teachers and discuss their child's progress. During fall and spring Parent/  Teacher conferences, parents of ELLs are strongly encouraged to visit the ENL room. The ENL teacher also visits each classroom  of the students she services to remind the parents and teachers to visit the ENL room. Parents have an opportunity to  communicate  their concerns with the ENL teacher and review their child's work folder to get a better understanding of their child's  needs and achievements. The school Leadership, our Parent Coordinator, SLT and PTA members invite parents/guardians  of ELLs to attend workshops that address the educational needs of ELLs, make translators available, disseminate materials  and notifications in the preferred language of communication to the parents/guardians, and provide information about  needed support services.  Our school provides translation services for ELLs' parents. All important notices are sent in the preferred language  of communication. Letters are translated by school personnel, when necessary we will use the NYCDOE Translation Service  Unit to translate our letters and notices into various languages spoken at P.S.12. We will have a translator from the Translation  Unit on site to assist parents when necessary. We keep an updated list of available personnel who can assist with translation  and interpretation services.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.      All parents, including ELL parents,  take part in our parent involvement activities. When planning our parent involvement  activities, we survey and listen to our parents as how we can best serve their needs. We host a series of workshops conducted  by the Parent Coordinator to support parents in understanding the curriculum. During these workshops, parents are made  aware of current data and are informed of student and parental expectations. Translators are available at all Parent/Teacher  conferences, parent workshops and PTA meetings. Parents are constantly encouraged to become a member of our PTA in  order to assist us in addressing their needs. Parents are invited to curriculum conferences to meet with their child’s teachers in  order to learn academic expectations for the school year and how they could assist at home. Parents are proactive in creating  school-wide activities such as Common Core Learning and Barbecue, Family Movie Night, Family Game Night, Family Art Night,  Family Night Skating, Bowling,  our Annual Cultural Awareness Day, and Annual Family Bar-b-que.  Every September, male  parents and caregivers are invited ot our Annual Dads Take Your Child to School Day, which highlights the important role that  males play in their children's success.  In addition, parents are invited to Open School Week to observe instruction and get  techniques that they can utilize at home.       Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Michele Luard, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Ronald  Edmonds Learning Cente                                                                              School DBN: 17K484  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
