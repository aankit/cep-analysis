This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Liberation Diploma Plus High School is a transfer high school serving students who are considered to be over-aged and  under-credited. The majority of our students have had their educational process interrupted due to a variety of issues  that include but are not limited to anxiety, substance abuse, parenting, depression, incarceration, homelessness,  domestic abuse and community violence. The mission of our school is grounded in Sankofa, a West African word that  means, “We must go back and learn our past in order to know who we are today, thereby empowering ourselves to  move forward.” Our students must be able to go back and analyze the factors, both external and internal, that caused  them to make poor/uninformed choices. We work with students through their journey back and provide them with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8      the support and avenues to move forward. In moving forward, students acquire the awareness that there are  consequences for their choices and a lot of the work with our students is making them understand that they do have  choices in how they react to their current circumstances. Our teaching and counseling staff work together to provide  an academically challenging and socially supportive environment to meet the needs of all of our students. These  nurturing surroundings engage and thus enable students to succeed so that they may reach their goals. Our charge is  not to educate and exile, but to educate and liberate. Our mission is to develop the whole student, academically,  socially, and emotionally not only from the point from where they are but also from where they were and where they  plan to go.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Although the circumstances that bring our students to Liberation differ, we find that the majority of our students have  anger management issues and/or levels of depression that often get in their way. Because our school is rooted in  Restorative Practices and Cultural Empowerment/Relevant Pedagogy, many of our students are able to move beyond  their anger and depression after consistently being able to voice their hurt. There is no magic number of how many  times a student sits in a restorative conversation (mediation) before students are able to own the source of their  anger, however, students learn to not only take ownership for their actions but they are also able to voice how and  why they reacted the way they did. Students begin to learn their triggers and we work with students in  building/strengthening their skill sets so that they can minimize the triggers and/or learn how to control their  reactions. Although Liberation opened grounded in restorative practices, the principal is moving toward being more  deliberate in the use of restorative language and collaborative problem solving techniques. The principal, assistant  principal, and the former social worker recently worked together on creating a protocol for students and staff  members to follow when having a restorative conversation/mediation. The social worker also worked with  administration to create a workshop on anger management. The principal works closely with D79 programs and has  been advocating getting a full time SAPIS counselor at Liberation to work closely with our students who are struggling  with and in danger due to substance abuse.   Liberation as a whole has been through a very rough few years and we have spent a tremendous amount of time  healing as a school community. In 2012-2013 we were totally devastated by Hurricane Sandy. In 2013-2014 we had a  student arrested during Regent exams for murder, another student arrested for setting fire in his building that  ultimately led to the death of a police officer, a student murdered by a retired police officer, and a teacher that many  students admired was removed from the building when we learned of an inappropriate relationship she was having  with a student. In 2014-2015 we started the year with two first year teachers, had a teacher removed pending 3020a  charges, and lost a teacher who had to take an early retirement to care for his grandchildren when his daughter  suddenly died. In addition, we have a few students in and out of rehab/hospitals for substance abuse, students are  angry with the recent events of officers killing unarmed men, and the violence in the community has taken the lives of  many other young people. In 2015-2016 our challenges continued as we started the year with four new teachers,  losing our founding AP in the middle of the year, and our instructional AP going out late in the year for a medical  issue.   We have continued to engage in many town hall meetings where students and staff were provided a safe place to  speak openly about their feelings in addition to small group and individual conversations to help heal. Both staff and  students were afforded the supports provided by SISFI as a means of community building as well as finding the  tools/space to heal individually and collaboratively. Additionally, in response to the mass school shootings that has  happened around the country, our students engaged in the National School Walk out spear headed by one of our  Special Education teachers. Considering our students have dealt with gun violence at some point in their lives, the  weeks leading up to Walk Out was therapeutic due to the nature of the school community working together to see  our vision actualized for the Walkout. With a combination of a new CBO staff sponsored by JCCA, a lot of training and  support was provided by the principal, guidance counselor, and Morningside Center for Teaching Social Responsibility.  In addition to individual counseling, students are receiving weekly social/emotional support in Leadership groups  provided by their Advocate Counselors.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      As a transfer school, most of the students who apply were LTAs (Long Term Absences) or students who have  previously dropped out of school and have returned to try to complete their high school education. Students who  were not LTAs usually had discipline or social/emotional problems which prompted them to change schools. In  addition, unlike some transfer schools, we accept students with zero credits. As LDPHS works on preparing these  students to overcome obstacles and prepare these students to become college and career ready, we have decided to  simultaneously work on students social/emotional and Academic Behavior skills, as research (conducted by the  University of Chicago) has shown that academic success in the high school and post-secondary institutions is tied to  social skills such as perseverance and communication/collaboration.   LDPHS worked with the Transfer School Common Core Institute (TSCCI) coordinated by NYCDOE Office of Post- secondary Readiness in conjunction with Eskolta and reDesign, in implementing strategies to help students to develop  effective academic behaviors. In 2014, the core inquiry team cross-walked the academic behaviors (persistence, work  habits/organizational skills, engagement, communication/collaboration skills, and self-regulation) with the Diploma  Plus personal competencies. We used the competencies because they addressed the same social/emotional skills  addressed in the academic behaviors piece and our teachers had been using them from the inception of the school.  This made the transition easier and also provided a template upon which the inquiry team made an Academic  Behaviors Rubric that uses the same scale (emerging, capable, bridging, proficient, and advanced) as all of our  Diploma Plus rubrics.   The principal has developed key relationships with the community and created a leadership group (Liberated Leaders  for C.H.A.N.G.E. (Community Helping a Neighborhood Gain Empowerment)) who are members of the Coney Island  Anti-Violence Coalition. Students meet with the coalition and our local Councilman monthly to discuss strategies and  offer recommendations for a safer community. The principal also partnered with a member in the community to  bridge the gap between police and the community. Students in Liberation along with other students in the community  participated in a basketball event in which police officers and teens teamed up to play competitively as well as talk  and simply have fun together. The principal then held a dinner at Liberation Diploma Plus to honor the officers and  community for coming together and taking the first steps to change mindsets. On this evening, we held a moment of  silence for those we have lost, including Eric Garner and Detectives Ramos and LIU. The principal in collaboration with  Lieutenant Donzel Cleare piloted a Junior Citizen’s Police Academy Class. One of the goals was to encourage students  to be the change they want to see in the NYPD and consider joining the NYPD. The principal partnered with the local  Cure Violence team and a mental health specialist and has hosted several Community Dinner Dialogues that focused  on the effects of trauma. The conversations in the Community Dinner Dialogues have resulted in a safe place for  generations of Coney Island residents to come and not only share their pain and struggles but to also be receptive to  healing and assistance.   The inquiry team took a look at overall credit accumulation, attendance, and the correlation with the Academic  Behaviors. After many discussions, analysis of Regents data, analysis of credit accumulation data, and analysis in  trends in attendance, the inquiry team decided to develop a system that would tackle many of the negative  quantitative data issues through the use of a merit system that would foster academic accountability on behalf of the  students and inculcate genuine self-efficacy to promote academic achievement. The overall goal of the merit system  is to increase student efficacy and self- regulation through a positive behavioral support system that allows students  to monitor their own growth through acquiring positive merits in academics, behavior, and attendance to earn  various incentives and accolades increasing in value as students move through five Tiers. Moreover, the goal towards  increasing credit accumulation and increasing College and Career Readiness is woven into the fabric of this system  which should increase an eagerness to be actively engaged in class, invoke persistence, increase their work habits and  organization skills, and effectively communicate & collaborate with their peers which is all monitored through self- regulation the key components of the Academic Behaviors.    The core inquiry team conducted action research throughout the 2015-2016 and 2016 - 2017 school-years to identify  evidence for each category and level on the Academic Behavior rubric. Team members observed students in classes  and made notes of behaviors (such as note taking) and how it affected learning. Then the team collaborated during   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      the weekly meetings to align specific behaviors along the rubric scale. This work continued throughout the 2017-2018  school year with new members of the team from the CBO (Community Based Organization) JCCA.    For the 2015-2016 school-year, the research focused on identifying strategies to use to foster these behaviors in our  students. The work has enabled staff to share insight on individual students to better understand students’ needs. The  collaborative process has allowed staff to compare notes on what works for particular students, which has increased  the repertoire of strategies to suggest. During inquiry meetings the team members are able to start by sharing  strategies and anecdotes. They then apply select strategies in their interactions with students to see if they are  effective. The result of these interactions are then shared with the Inquiry team at the next meeting during which all  the team members are invited to ask questions and make suggestions. The team then continues the process of action  research until the most effective strategies are identified and recorded. Ultimately, the goal of the inquiry team is to  disseminate the rubric and strategies to the entire Liberation staff to enable them to give feedback and begin  implementing the tools in every classroom.   Teachers have received professional development to help foster our pedagogy of Culturally Responsive/Relevant  Pedagogy with ‘Breaking the Cycle Consulting Service’ team. Teachers had a series of sessions in which they were  immersed in the theory and rationale of CRP and the actual practice in the classrooms. An example of this is the  workshop on the relationship between Culturally Responsive Pedagogy and DFFT Knowledge of Students (1b).  Teachers were taken through a series of activities that helped them deconstruct the component and align it to the  pedagogy of our school. As a result, teachers are expected to align their curricula units, lessons, and teaching  practices to the pedagogy of Liberation. Furthermore, select staff members were sent to the Coalition of Schools  Educating Boys of Color Conference (COSEBOC) three years in a row to gain more knowledge and strategies to work  with the socio-emotional issues, cultural empowerment gains, and lessen the achievement gap for our boys of color  at Liberation.    Liberation staff is committed to preparing all of our students to be college and career ready. Staff meetings and  professional development sessions have been held with the school community to revisit our school’s mission and  vision to ensure that we as a school community are providing our students with a college and career ready culture.  The initiatives that we have employed and the impact of our efforts are discussed below:   · Liberation has also taken steps to improve our students’ college and career readiness and completing their  applications to post-secondary institutions. During the 2017-2018 school year, the principal tasked select staff  members to be a part of the College Access For All (CA4A) team to foster a culture of College and Career Readiness in  the school. The team worked with a CA4A coach in action planning with specific targeted calendar benchmarks and  goals to meet. The team worked on conducting a Parent College Night to equip parents with the necessary knowledge  about the CUNY, SUNY, and financial aid application process. The guidance counselor meets with students daily to  complete CUNY and SUNY college applications. Parents are contacted by phone during which parents are informed of  what is needed to complete each student’s college application. The guidance counselor also sits with seniors to assist  them in completing the FAFSA and TAP applications. Students also receive help to apply for jobs and create resumes  for interviews and volunteer work. Students also receive assistance in registering for the SAT's. 100% of the senior  class has had individual conferences to assess their post-secondary readiness, building culture and preparing students,  match students and make the best fit opportunities with college and career. As a result of our efforts so far, 63% of  the senior class have completed their CUNY applications and 4% completed the SUNY application. In addition, 29% of  students have registered for trade and certification programs.   · Our guidance counselor has meetings and workshops with parents around the college application and financial aid  process. Many times the guidance counselor has family intervention meetings when the parent refuses to share  his/her tax information when applying for financial aid.   · All college application fees are paid via fee waivers, JCCA budget, the principal or adults in the community are asked  to sponsor a student’s college application.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      · College Trips: It is mandatory for all students to attend college trips. We take students to local college fairs and visit  both CUNY and SUNY colleges. These trips have helped to encourage students to see themselves in college and  imagine life beyond high school. Student testimonies and college acceptances for students who said they never would  attend college are some of the indicators that exposure to college life prior to graduation has helped change  mindsets. This year our students attended the SUNY College Fair at the Jacob Javits Center, NYC Big Apple College Fair,  Delaware State University, Medgar Evers College, Baruch College, and SUNY Albany.   · Internships/Seminar: We have a Learn to Work component attached to our program. All students are required to  fulfill an internship (or have a job) before graduating from Liberation. Student interns are paid minimum wage and are  able to work up to fifteen hours per week. Our internship coordinator assists students with finding job placement,  resume writing, and interviewing skills. All interns attend seminar once a week for workshops designed to assist  students with proper job etiquette, understanding taxes, banking, troubleshoot issues students may be having on the  job site, and to allow students to share positive stories. Students are also assisted with business attire when  necessary. Some internships have led to full-time employment post-graduation.   · Graduation portfolio: All students must complete a graduation portfolio before receiving their diplomas. The  graduation portfolio consists of best works, an updated resume, two college snapshots, a letter of thanks to their  internship provider, a description of a community service project, completed college application, completed FAFSA  form, a future focus essay, and an autobiography. The autobiography requires students to go on a journey from their  past to present, articulate their growth/ownership for their choices and how they plan to move forward (Sankofa).  Students are videotaped while reading their autobiographies and we use their presentations as motivation for present  staff (reminders of the transitions students make) and the data to inform us on what contributed to each student’s  success, i.e. caring teachers, supportive staff, life lessons learned, being pushed to work harder, when they realized  they are worthy of success, etc.   · Struggling seniors are registered in our Achieve Now Academy which takes place after school. We offer additional  academic classes, tutoring, counseling and college/career guidance. Students attending the Achieve Now Academy  were given first priority to attend the SUNY Albany trip and will be going on a trip to Washington D.C.   · We hold both a female and male empowerment brunch at which we invite guests from various professions to mingle  with our students. Students have built long-term relationships with these professionals that have led to internships,  paid training and employment opportunities.   · Our school-wide use of the Academic Behavior document is used to support our students with specific  social/emotional and academic skills such as self-regulation that students will need to be successful in college and  post-secondary life. Students are shown where they are and are offered supports to get them to where they need to  be.   · The assistant principal is in conversations with representatives from Touro College in order to develop professional  development sessions that will be CTLE certified, acquire student teachers, and possibly partner with the college to  work with students to prepare them for an academic life in college.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Due to the very nature of Liberation and the population that we serve, we consider our entire student body to require  special attention to deal with the very issues and traumas that may have impeded their educational journey and  brought them here to Liberation. Many students are dealing with severe socio-emotional and economic issues that  can interfere with learning. There are many that have found the traditional route in education was not the best fit for  them and was not able to navigate the confusion of larger high schools. Each student is assigned an Advocate  Counselor that works with them throughout the school year. The ACs coach, advise, counsel, keep track of attendance  and academics, and guide students through some of the most demanding issues that come with adolescence and  early adulthood. Students also may seek out the guidance of an Advocate Counselor when they are in crisis to have  one-on-one sessions with. All students are involved in Leadership/Advisory sessions twice a week where important   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      topics are introduced, discusses, and worked through. The ACs not only work with students, but the play an integral  role in parent/guardian outreach. student mediations, and restorative conversations. Many students find solace in  knowing that they have an adult who they can confide in who supports their emotional and academic growth.   Out of the approximately 220 students we have on register, 88 students are SWDS or 40%, and 20 students have 504s.  Our SWDs population is serviced by two special education teachers and one of two guidance counselors.  Academically, all teachers are responsible for knowing the management needs of their students with IEPs and the  critical information stated in their PLoP. Teachers are charged with writing curricula units that addresses our  pedagogy of a Universally Designed curriculum, lessons that are tailored to meet the needs of our SWDs, providing  multiple entry points into the content, scaffolding skills for lower literacy levels in reading and writing, instructional  strategies that are differentiated through process, content, and product, and using data to adjust planning and  instruction. Furthermore, considering we have two special education teachers, they are both assigned to the English  department for ICT (Integrated Co-Teaching) classes to raise the literacy skills of our SWDs. In these classes, all  students receive the benefit of having two teachers who structure their classes by the models of co-teaching to  maximize learning for all students. Of our SWDs, we have mixture of students who are categorized with a learning  disability or an emotional disability. Students are frequently seen by the guidance counselor in charge of Special  Education for counseling and academic support. The special education teachers make a concerted effort to write  quality IEPs that are up to date and inclusive of teacher observations and recommendations.    For some of our most at-risk students, many of them are a part of the principal's Liberated Leaders group and or the  Junior Citizen Police Academy. For these groups of students, positive role models and mentors, a sense of purpose,  and an understanding of the value of hard work are just a few of the things that are put in place. More importantly,  the students who are a part of the JCPA are often students who have had negative associations with law enforcement,  dangerous neighborhood conflicts, and struggles with good decision making. By fostering relationships with the police  and the various units in the NYPD, students and law enforcement officers are able to allow the mystique of each other  to evaporate and create a new understanding and appreciation for the lives of the community members they serve.  Students are able to dispel the negative connotations that are associated with police due to the racist attitudes and  actions some carry towards people of color and has tainted officers in NYC and around the country.             4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Based on our Quality Review Data the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which our school made the  most progress in over this past year are Supportive Environment, Effective School Leadership, and Strong  Family/Community Ties. The key areas of focus for the coming school year are in Rigorous Instruction and  Collaborative Teachers.   Liberation’s 2014-2015 Quality Review yielded the following results:   Instructional Core  1.1 Ensure engaging, rigorous, and coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners and aligned to  Common Core Learning Standards and/or content standards. – Proficient  1.2 Develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best that is informed by the  instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligned to the curricula, engaging, and meets the needs of  all learners so that all students produce meaningful work products. - Proficient  2.2 Align assessments to curricula, use on-going assessment and grading practices, and analyze information on  student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team and classroom levels. – Well Developed  School Culture  To what extent does the school...   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      3.4 Establish a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students and families, and provide  supports to achieve those expectations. – Well Developed  Systems for Improvement  To what extent does the school...  4.2 Engage in structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared  leadership and focuses on improved student learning. – Well Developed                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 21K728   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   225   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.        For the 2017-2018 school year, all of the subject area curricula has been aligned to content area and CCLS standards.  This practice will continue throughout the 2018-2019 school year. Teachers will prepare curricula units during the  Annual Summer Planning Week. These units will be reviewed, feedback will be provided, and revisions will be made to  ensure coherence and effective pedagogy. The vast majority of curricula units are inclusive of the school’s Culturally  Responsive, Universally Designed approach to education, and remains Student Centered with a push towards Student  Autonomy. All content area curricula units are inclusive of all learners providing the appropriate access, inclusive of  the instructional foci of the school (argumentative literacy and the Habits of Mind for mathematics) in order to  promote higher order/critical thinking skills and college and career readiness. Assessments are used regularly  throughout each trimester (three formatives and one summative for the 2016-2017 school year, however for the  2017-2018 and 2018-2019 school years, there will be a total of two formative assessments and one summative  assessment per trimester) to monitor students’ progress towards acquiring skills and concepts related to the  instructional foci and scope and sequence content in the subject areas. Teaching strategies are inclusive of  instructional scaffolds, modeling high quality work products, student centered learning activities, and universal design  elements to meet the needs of diverse learners.   The typical Regents performance at the school highlights the academic deficits with which the students arrive at our  school. After assessing the June 2017 Regents item analysis in CC English Regents with a 31% pass rate and CC Algebra  I Regents with a 28% pass rate, teacher observation data from Danielson Framework for Teaching (1a, 1e, and 3b),  formative assessment data, student work products, and feedback from the fall 2016 PPR, students need to engage in  more rigorous instruction and academic tasks in order to promote higher order/critical thinking skills and evidence of  college and career readiness. Student data shows a gap in teaching and learning in rigor, engaging students in  productive struggle with complex texts (understanding academic vocabulary in context, inferring meaning,  improvements in academic writing, and reading stamina); developing a deep conceptual understanding in  mathematics, increasing basic algebraic skills and knowledge, building academic stamina and independence, and  using the habits of mind as an access point into the content; more differentiated learning tasks that maintains rigor  yet scaffolds for specific learners; and an increase in argumentative literacy to promote college & career readiness.   Looking at the Common Core English Regents and Common Core Algebra I Regents data from June 2018, it is clear  that the school has to deal with academic challenges to overcome some of the underdeveloped literacy and  mathematical levels our students come in to Liberation with. We prioritize these two exams because they are  indicators for College and Career Readiness. For the June 2018 English Regents: 71 students were scheduled, 36 were  absent, 35 were present, 18 or 51% of students passed, 17 or 49% failed; 36 SWDs were scheduled, 22 were absent,  14 were present, 7 or 50% of students who were present passed, 7 or 50% failed; 35 General Ed. students were   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16      scheduled, 14 were absent, 21 were present, 10 or 48% passed, and 12 or 57% failed. For the Common Core Algebra I  Regents data: 63 students scheduled, 37 absent, 26 present, 10 or 38% passed, 16 or 62% failed; 27 SWDs scheduled,  14 absent, 13 present, 8 or 62% passed, 5 or 38% failed; 36 General Education students were scheduled, 23 absent, 13  present, 2 or 15% passed, 11 or 85% failed.   Based on the school’s fall 2016 and spring 2018 Principal Performance Observation (PPO) findings of 'Proficient' in  indicator 1.2 and teacher data in Danielson’s Framework for Teaching component 1e, 3b and 3c, along with student  achievement data, the areas for improvement are to raise the level of rigor in academic tasks, the quality of student  written work products, and the quality of questions and student led discussions. During the 2017-2018 school year,  teachers began to work more aggressively in planning units that were designed to challenge students' thinking,  engage students in meaningful content, task students with delivering work products that provided for student choice,  and shift the dynamics of teaching and learning to the student. Teachers began to adapt protocols for more student  led discussions (Including the Socratic Seminar, discussion norms, the use of models of co-teaching, communication  and collaboration for productive struggle, and other discussion protocols) that forced students to think, ponder, ask  questions, and productively struggle with each other. Accordingly, based on April 16th's PPR feedback for the 2018- 2019 school year, teachers will continue to push the level of rigor in the classrooms through a Student  Centered/Learner Centered approach with a shift towards Student Autonomy that coincides with 'Well Developed' for  1.2 on the Quality Review rubric.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.      By June of the 2018-2019 school year, 100% of teachers will have written and been evaluated on delivering curricula  units that are common core aligned, appropriately scaffolded, rigorous through student centered/learner centered  learning task rubrics, differentiated for all learners, and rigorous.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Liberation Diploma Plus High School is a school that functions on the belief of educating and tending to the 'whole'  child. The school has a strong socio-emotional element that ensures students are paired with an advocate counselor  from the CBO JCCA. These advocate counselors support the emotional and social growth of our students by helping  them navigate the rigors of a complex and confusing time in an adolescent and young adults life. From academic  counseling, conducting restorative conversations, addressing students who are in serious emotional/physical crisis, to  one-on-one emotional counseling, the CBO team compliments the instructional staff in balancing the hurdles that our  students face that in many instances impedes their cognitive function and avenues of learning. The guidance  counselors provides much of the same services along with maintaining the compliance components ensuring our  students with special needs are serviced. Partnerships with organizations contribute to the overall familial  atmosphere of the school culture. Students are made to feel safe by a staff that is responsive to occurrences,  maintains communication with parents/guardians, addresses student to student conflicts quickly through mediation  and counseling, and ensuring the building and perimeter are safe and secure with the partnership of NYPD School  Safety Unit assigned to the school.     Additionally, the school has a partnership with another Coney Island organization Operation H.O.O.D (Helping Our  Own Develop) that works to help decrease the violence in the Coney Island neighborhood. The organization's  members are willing to aide our school in various ways including mediation, counseling of gang members in the  immediate community that may affect the safety of our students, paid internships, and assisting with minimizing the  neighborhood violence around the school that may spill into our school through the students. Moreover, the Junior  Citizens Police Academy in conjunction with the NYPD is a program created to foster positive community/police  relationships and assist both the police and our students in developing an understanding of each other as persons  that can benefit from a healthy relationship with law enforcement. Through this partnership, the school and its  students have become a safer place.     As a transfer high school that operates on a trimester schedule, one of the main foci is for students to accumulate  credits quickly over the course of three trimesters and receive a high school diploma. Our students on average earn  approximately three out of six credits per trimester. Over the course of the 2016-2017 school-year for the first two  trimesters, students attempted 2039.5 credits; and of that number, 49% of those credits were earned. Subsequently,  for the 2017-2018 school year, students attempted approximately 2600 credits for the first two trimesters and earned  47.15% of the credits attempted. Another focus is to foster College and Career Readiness by focusing on  argumentative writing and the skills necessary to effectively engage in argumentative literacy, and incorporate  Academic Behaviors into the curriculum to achieve a smoother transition from high school to colleges or the  workforce.    After an administrative and collaborative review with teachers of our academic program, we decided to make some  targeted adjustments to our curriculum and instructional program to promote rigor, challenge students further to  become better critical thinkers, and autonomous learners. The data that we used were the common assessments for   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23      the 2017-2018 school year with six formative and three summative assessments, 2018 January Regents data, student  work products in discussions and writing, and the written feedback from the April 16, 2018 PPO report. The  commonality amongst these assessments was that students will have to do a better job of analysis in reading and  writing which is geared towards the school’s instructional focus and teachers will have to plan to teach how  to think  critically and plan more effective student centered learning tasks, which allow for our students to be challenged and  engage in productive struggle. This data was reviewed over the course of the school year during the department PLCs  using various protocols such as the ‘Analyzing Student Work’ protocol, DFFT ADVANCE teacher observation data in  '3b,' addressed during weekly professional developments, and discussed during Saturday Teacher Workshops.  Furthermore, although we received a ‘Proficient’ on our Fall 2017’s school’s PPO for indicator 1.2 pedagogy (rigor in  academic tasks and learning activities) as well as the Spring 2018 PPO, there were areas for improvement in rigor,  critical thinking, and engaging students in consistent high levels of discourse across all classrooms.    Moreover, administrators and teachers review, analyze, and interpret Measures of Teacher Practice data through  ADVANCE to determine what areas in instructional pedagogy and design need to be adjusted to maximize student  learning gains. After review of various components in Danielson’s Framework for Teaching, areas for improvement  have been identified as 3b, ‘Questioning and Discussion Techniques’ 3d, ‘Assessment in Instruction,’ and 1e,  ‘Designing Coherent Instruction.’ We found that there is a direct correlation between 3b, ‘Questioning and Discussion  Techniques’ and rigor as well as 3b and Student Centered Learning. The instructional team has and will continue to  focus on the relationship with 3b and rigor, with an increase in higher order questions, more student to student  discourse through the use of various discussion protocols, student centered learning tasks that will foster student  autonomy, and space to foster critical thinking in order to prepare students for College and Career readiness.  Additionally, 3d, ‘Assessment in Instruction’ was and is an area that all teachers want to improve due to the need to  actively monitor student learning and progress in class lessons, towards our school’s academic goals. Also, we found  that students need to receive better feedback that will impact learning through timely, actionable, that is specifically  rubric based. These two components must be supported by having a strong foundation in ‘Designing Coherent  Instruction,’ 1e with cohesive curricula units and effectively written lesson plans that provide access for all students  with opportunities to become autonomous learners.   The need that we determined was to increase credit accumulation and prepare our students for College and Career  Readiness by acquiring the skills of argumentative literacy as their foundation which will provide stronger analytical,  evaluation, and research skills. We believe this will help our students meet the needs of the CCLS and obtain their  course credits that will lead to graduation. We decided to intensely focus on College and Career Readiness on various  levels. On the academic level, we decided as an instructional staff to increase our efforts in argumentative writing by  focusing on three specific areas (analysis, elaboration and explanation of clear and thorough evidence, and increasing  the quality of teacher feedback). Over the course of three summers, we deconstructed Common Core standard one  for writing, re-evaluated and revised two writing rubrics, and focused on common language that will be used  throughout the school. Also over the summers, teachers reviewed their curricula units and have/will revise them  based on the skills coming out of reading and writing standard one from the Common Core. Teachers will look to  provide access into the curriculum by making it more relevant and applicable to the real world through the use of  connections. Furthermore, we decided that in order to build better analytical skills of our students, students would  need to be engaged in more academic discourse with their peers. Students are being tasked to engage in discussions,  seminars, and debates with their peers through structured norms and protocols for discussion that will require  students to support their claims, hypotheses, theses, and opinions with relevant and thorough evidence/support from  a range of sources. By providing students with a curriculum that is relevant, applicable, engaging, and geared toward  argumentative literacy which is rigorous, coherent, and rich with questions that are higher order, we should be able  to get our students to think, discuss, and write critically in the various content areas. This type of curriculum would  foster engagement and participation on the students’ behalf, in turn, helping students acquire credits and increase  argumentative literacy skills.    Next, we decided to incorporate Academic Behavior Inquiry into our systems and structures using the Academic  Behavior rubric. These skills will allow students to better navigate their academic life as well as their post-secondary  life. This ongoing action research tracks students’ progress in the classroom from ‘Emerging 1’ to ‘Advanced 5’ in the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          24      acquisition of College and Career Readiness skills. Students and teachers are able to assess and build awareness of  these soft skills in order to formulate better strategies for themselves to move across the Academic Behavior rubric.    LDPHS worked with the Transfer School Common Core Institute (TSCCI) coordinated by NYCDOE Office of  Postsecondary Readiness in conjunction with Eskolta and Redesign in creating strategies to help students to develop  effective academic behaviors. In 2014-2015 the core inquiry team cross-walked the academic behaviors (persistence,  work habits/organizational skills, engagement, communication/collaboration skills, and self-regulation) with the  Diploma Plus personal competencies.   The core inquiry team began conducting action research throughout the 2013-2014 school-year to identify evidence  for each category and level on the Academic Behavior rubric. Team members observed students in classes and made  notes of behaviors (such as note taking) and how it affected learning. Then the team collaborated during the weekly  meetings to align specific behaviors along the rubric scale.   For the 2014-2015 school-year, the research focused on identifying strategies to use to foster these behaviors in our  students. The work has enabled staff to share insight on individual students to better understand students’ needs. The  collaborative process has allowed staff to compare notes on what works for particular students, which has increased  the repertoire of strategies to suggest and implement.   For the 2015-2016 school year, LDPHS will not be in the TSCCI (we completed the three year program limit), but the  work on academic behaviors needs to continue. Although the core inquiry team is versed in the academic behaviors,  the rest of the staff has been introduced but not yet familiar with the strategies developed/identified to foster  adaptation of positive academic behaviors in our students. As a result, LDPHS has to ensure that all teachers are  involved in using the completed rubric and strategy bank in the 2015-2016 school-year. In addition, teachers,  counseling staff, and administration need to continue to build upon the strategy bank as action research continues  throughout the year.   Besides using the rubric and the strategy bank, teachers, counseling staff, and administrators have to measure  student progress to identify any impact that implementation of strategies have on students’ academic progress. One  tool that has to be further developed is the student/teacher checklist that is used as an evaluation form that allows  students to self-reflect. This tool also has to be developed and implemented in the 2015-2016 school year. This will  involve ongoing collaboration among the various stakeholders of the school community. LDPHS staff will also have to  continue to look at student work (LASW) and identify the academic behavior that may be hampering students’  academic progress and implement strategies for targeted groups of students.   For the 2016-2017 school-year, the Inquiry Team analyzed and interpreted the data concerning credit accumulation  since 2012 and Academic Behaviors bi-weekly using student reflection forms concerning Academic Behaviors.  Conclusively, the team discussed the impact of lower credit accumulation during the second trimester since 2012 as  the data suggests, instructional implications, attendance, student engagement/’buy-in’ to learning, and the link to  Academic Behaviors. The team discussed ways in which students can be reached and given another perspective on  engaging in their learning here at Liberation. Along with the continuation of implementing Academic Behaviors in the  classroom and with the advisors, The Liberation Merit System was developed during this time from scratch based off  of the concept of ‘bit-coins.’ However, unlike the bit coins, this system will be tracked through our online grading and  communication system SKEDULA. The Liberation Merit System, tracked through SKEDULA, will be used as a five tier  positive behavioral support system available for students to be awarded academic, behavior, and attendance merits  according to staff members’ assessment of students who have ‘earned’ these merits. As students earn merits at  various increments, they will progress to the next Tier, all increasing in value in which various incentives will be  scheduled. Throughout the school year, there will be several ‘Flash Merit Incentives’ where students can earn merits  based on a specific category (academics, behavior, or attendance) to increase their collection of merits and chances of  participating in the scheduled incentive. Students will be able to track their own accumulation and progression of  merits on SKEDULA through Pupil Path. Staff members began awarding merits during Case Conferencing and/or  during other times of the day during the 2017-2018 school year. What we noticed was that there was a core group of  approximately 35 to 40 students who were earning enough merits to move on to the next Tier of the system and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          25      earned the incentive reward. Many students who noticed this trend taking place began to inquire more about the  system and as the school year continued, outside of the core group of students maintaining their accumulation of  merits, other students began entering into the Tiers to earn the rewards. Earned incentives included an Ice Cream  Social, Brunch and Broadway, Dinner and Broadway, and New Roc City's Fun Fuzion.    Lastly, during the Annual Summer Planning session of 2018, the teachers devised a system to enable students to work  together, support each other, task them with using all of their academic behaviors in their work, and increase Regents  and course pass rates through a 'Peer Tutoring' program. Although this initiative is in its infancy stage, this system will  be developed as a main staple in the push towards closing the gap between course pass rates and Regents pass rates.  After reviewing the data from the 2017-2018 school year, it was clear that there are disparities in students failing the  Regents yet passing courses for a number of reasons. The idea is to have students who were successful on their  Regents exams and in classes serve as peer tutors. This program will be joined with the Learn To Work (LTW) program  where peer tutors will work as student interns and be compensated monetarily. Tutors will also receive Liberation  merits, as well as participants who come for tutoring on a consistent basis.    With the aforementioned, containing a supportive emotional, safe, and academic environment, students should be  able to obtain course credits, increase credit accumulation, and increase College and Career Readines.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

By the end of the 2018-2019 school year, we intend on increasing course credit accumulation by 1% and  increasing College and Career Readiness for all students between ‘Bridging’ and ‘Proficient’ on the Academic  Behavior rubric. This data will be monitored and measured through the use of mid-term progress reports, six  formative and three summative assessments, the fall and spring PPO visits, the January and June Regents  data, monitoring the online grading system of SKEDULA (for academic growth ), and tracking students’  progress in College and Career Readiness through the use of the Academic Behaviors rubrics which is 5% of  the students' grade tracked by SKEDULA.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          26     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

We found that this was enabling and  hindering students from becoming autonomous thinkers  and learners. The teaching staff decided to use  instructional scaffolds solely for instructional purposes  during classroom instruction. When students are being  assessed in their formative and summative assessments,  they will not be given instructional scaffolds to lean on.  Instead, students will have to demonstrate their  understanding and proficiency of concepts, content, and  skills to the best of their abilities. Teachers will quickly  analyze and interpret the students' performance and  adjust instruction based on this data. Scaffolds will be  provided during the next phase of teaching and learning  based on the adjusted curriculum. Students will then  have to perform on the next round of common  assessments which is the Mock Regents/formative  assessment number two for non-Regents takers and  demonstrate their acquisition of content, concepts, and  skills again without instructional scaffolds. During  Saturday Teacher Workshops, teachers will review,  analyze, and interpret student assessment data to again  adjust curriculum, begin the writing the next trimester's  curricula units, and/or adjust the summative  assessments.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   One of the strengths here at Liberation is the willingness of the instructional staff and support staff to work together,  collaborate, plan, develop initiatives, and carry-out strategies that are centered around greater student learning  outcomes. As a school, LDPHS has two major teams that works directly and indirectly with helping with student  achievement. The Inquiry Team indirectly fosters learning through action research of the soft skills necessary to  function academically and for college and career readiness. The team is made up of of teachers, the assistant  principal, Advocate Counselors, the guidance counselor, and the parent coordinator.    LDPHS Inquiry Team worked with the Transfer School Common Core Institute (TSCCI) coordinated by NYCDOE Office  of Post secondary Readiness in conjunction with Eskolta and Redesign in creating strategies to help students to  develop effective academic behaviors. In 2014-2015 the core inquiry team cross-walked the academic behaviors  (persistence, work habits/organizational skills, engagement, communication/collaboration skills, and self-regulation)  with the Diploma Plus personal competencies.   The core inquiry team began conducting action research throughout the 2013-2014 school-year to identify evidence  for each category and level on the Academic Behavior rubric. Team members observed students in classes and made  notes of behaviors (such as note taking) and how it affected learning. Then the team collaborated during the weekly  meetings to align specific behaviors along the rubric scale.   For the 2015-2016 school-year, the research focused on identifying strategies to use to foster these behaviors in our  students. The work has enabled staff to share insight on individual students to better understand students’ needs. The  collaborative process has allowed staff to compare notes on what works for particular students, which has increased  the repertoire of strategies to suggest and implement.   Although LDPHS will not be in the TSCCI (we completed the three year program limit), but the work on academic  behaviors needs to continue. Although the core inquiry team is versed in the academic behaviors, and the rest of the  staff has been introduced they are still in the process of being well versed with the strategies developed/identified to  foster adaptation of positive academic behaviors in our students. As a result, LDPHS has to ensure that all teachers are  involved in using the completed rubric and strategy bank in the 2018-2019 school-year. In addition, teachers,  counseling staff, and administration need to continue to build upon the strategy bank as action research continues  throughout the year.   Besides using the rubric and the strategy bank, teachers, counseling staff, and administrators have to measure  student progress to identify any impact that implementation of strategies have on students’ academic progress. One  tool that still has to be further developed is the student/teacher checklist that is used as an evaluation form that  allows students to self-reflect. This tool also has to be further developed and implemented in the 2018-2019 school  year. This will involve ongoing collaboration among the various stakeholders of the school community and inquiry   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          31      team. LDPHS staff will also have to continue to look at student work and identify the academic behavior that may be  hampering students’ academic progress and implement strategies for targeted groups of students.   LDPHS serves students who are over-aged and under-credited. As a transfer school, most of the students who apply to  our program were LTAs or students who have previously dropped out of school and have returned to try to complete  their high school education. Students who were not LTAs usually had discipline or social/emotional problems which  prompted them to change schools. In addition, unlike some transfer schools, we accept students with zero credits if  they pass the TABE Reading and Mathematics with a sixth grade reading and math level. As LDPHS works on preparing  these students to overcome obstacles and prepare these students to become college and career ready, we have  decided to place emphasis on simultaneously working on students’ social/emotional and academic skills, as research  (conducted by the University of Chicago) has shown that academic success in high school and post-secondary  institutions is tied to social skills such as perseverance and work habits. To measure the effectiveness of specific  strategies the inquiry team worked with a target group of students throughout the year.   The second team that works directly with teaching and learning is the instructional team. This group of teachers work  tirelessly to build curriculum that the students deserve, aim to teach beyond the Regents, and build experiences for  students that will connect content and concepts that the will help students synthesize material. The teachers begin  their collaboration in the summer with the annual "Summer Curriculum Planning' sessions. Each summer the planning  has graduated from learning how to write coherent, CCLS aligned, rigorous curriculum to a more savvy fluid approach  where teachers are more engrossed on finding the 'right' tools or resources to expose our students to the most  current data, content, concept, or experience as possible. Teachers work together to analyze data and interpret the  findings to develop the best fit instructional scaffolds and approaches to the their respective disciplines as possible.  Teachers share best practices, ideas, material, cross-curricula content, and Student Centered Learning approaches  (discussion norms, protocols, techniques for 3b). Throughout the school year, the instructional team will continue this  work of teaching and learning from each other and student data. Teachers will not only be developed by the assistant  principal of supervision but will be developed in structured professional development sessions by their peers. During  the past two school years, teachers have engaged in inter-visitations, best practice shares, and structured professional  developments which have gone fairly well in terms of teachers building a culture of trust, learning how to deliver  feedback, and sharing of pedagogical methods. Moving forward, teachers will learn from each other in the field of  classroom learning. The goal is for teachers to be able to provide each other with clear, specific, rubric based feedback  that will advance student learning and build teacher pedagogy in the process along with taking the lead in their own  growth and capacity building as instructional leaders.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, 100% of teachers will have participated in structured professional development sessions based in  student centered learning delivered by the assistant principal and their peers, collaborate in PLCs to assess  student work products through analysis protocols directly related to teaching and learning, conduct trimester  peer inter-visitations deliver specific, targeted feedback, that is aligned to Danielson's Framework for Teaching,  and rated 'Effective' in 3b of DFFT which is correlated with student centered learning and rigor. This will be  measured using DFFT ADVANCE data.   By June of 2019, representatives from each of the content areas will have been active members of the Inquiry  Team, working with a support staff of Advocate Counselors having conducted a full school-year of implementing  and monitoring the Academic Behaviors through the ABI rubric for each department and Advocate Counselors’  classroom observations and counseling sessions. These efforts will be monitored through SKEDULA, trimester  ABI reports based on classroom action research observations, and the Liberation Merit System.

By February of 2019, most teachers will have at least two rounds of informal observations with clear rubric based  feedback and those who have chosen Option #1, will have had one formal observation in addition.     By February of 2019, all teachers in their department PLCs and or Saturday Teacher Workshop days, will have  engaged in at least two rounds of structured protocols (EQUIP, Unit Refining, Analyzing Student Work, or a Lesson  Plan study using 1a and 1e) to monitor and assess the quality of planning, instruction, and student work products.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   The principal fosters professional growth by encouraging teachers and staff to take intellectual and professional risks  by spear heading a professional growth opportunity, delivering mini-workshops on best practices, leading in creative  projects, and supporting extended professional learning outside of the school building. The school works hard at  maintaining well developed in 1.3, 2.2, 4.2, and 3.4. During the 2018-2019 school year, select teachers will work with  representatives from TOURO College to develop professional development sessions that are in alignment with our  school's pedagogy and CTLE standards. These sessions will be planned in accordance to CTLE standards to provide NYS  certification credits to teachers who are in need of acquiring them to complete their certification.  Teacher teams are encouraged and fostered through professional development and access. In these PLCs, teachers  work together to analyze and interpret student data to drive and adjust instruction, figure out best practices that  work for specific skills, content, and concept instruction, and work together to provide clear rubric based feedback to  students to advance learning. Teacher teams meet daily, supplied by a weekly PLC schedule to maintain a structured  approach to data, teaching, and learning. Each Friday, department members meet with a member of the JCCA staff to  conduct ABI conferences where there is a share-out of information regarding the department's academic behavior in  correlation with students. JCCA members discuss their classroom observations of students and their counseling  sessions using 'self regulation.'  For the school year 2017-2018, one teacher took on the task of getting the school Google aligned by taking Google  classes with certification over the summer, creating a domain name, webpage, and delivering workshops for the staff  to help ease the transition to Google suites. This work will continue with another member of the instructional staff  who has taken on the task of keeping the school Google competent.  Another campaign the principal asked key staff members to take part of was the CA4A team during the 2017-2018  school year. The CA4A team was launched and lead by the guidance counselor in charge of College readiness along  with members of our CBO JCCA, the assistant principal, school aid and former alumni, and parent coordinator. The  team worked throughout the school year to create college awareness through college fair trips, college trips, parent  college and career night, college workshops and one on one guidance with the college adviser/guidance counselor,  and parental involvement surveys to check the temperature of parents' knowledge about the college and financial aid  process. As a result of the work of the CA4A team we had a total of 46 graduates from Dec 2017- June 2018. 38  students applied and were accepted to a post-secondary option ( college, COOP Tech). Two students will be joining  the military, 18 students will be attending college, 3 students will be attending COOP Tech. 18 students have filled out  and completed the FAFSA application.   This work will continue throughout the 2018-2019 school year starting with college fairs, parent meet and greet night  with a CA4A table set up to expose parents to the college process.  Throughout the school year, the principal initiated two mental health workshops for the staff in dealing with  'secondary trauma' when working with our students. Additionally, there are a number of programs like JCPA,  Liberated Leaders, the Arts, and the counseling from the CBO JCCA that tend to the emotional well being of the  students.    The CBO JCCA will be working with students during Advisory/Leadership groups to foster better socio-emotional well  being, leadership skills, and post-secondary life skills. The Advocate Counselors work with students in their case loads   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      by conducting parent/ student outreach, counseling sessions, crisis management, and restorative conversations/  mediation. Advocate Counselors play a vital role in the mental and emotional health for our students because the  counselors and students build bonds that allow students to talk with their counselors without feeling ashamed of  their sometimes difficult lives. The counselors provide a safe and healthy space for students to feel comfortable  sharing sensitive and many time troublesome information with, that may prohibit students from learning due to the  heavy burdens many of our students face and carry with them in school.    Teachers are empowered with the opportunity to plan effectively during the summer based on their work with the  assistant principal on curriculum and instructional strategies. Throughout the school year, the principal approved key  Saturday Teacher Workshops for teachers to conduct in-depth item analysis for the Regents, curriculum adjustments,  professional development workshops on 3b and Rigor, and having the SPED teachers conduct workshops on  maximizing the information from reading IEPs.   One area that we will be working on further this school year is to begin to turn the tides of professional development  over to the instructional staff. After working closely with the instructional staff from January 2015 until the summer of  2018, the assistant principal of supervision will be showing teachers how to develop, plan, and deliver professional  development sessions that are in alignment with our school's pedagogical belief of Student Centered/Learner  Centered Learning along with other areas that are important to our instructional focus with the assistance and  partnership from TOURO College. It is our belief that the teachers have benefited from PD Cycles, Saturday Teacher  Workshops, Two Week Summer Planning Sessions four years in a row, year round professional development, outside  professional development, inter-visitation rounds, and peer best practice shares. After a few years of development  and teaching teachers how to create curriculum, at this stage, teachers are fully equipped and empowered to create  their own unique aligned curricula units. At this point, the learning and capacity building is extending to professional  development. Based on the PPO from the fall of 2016 and the spring of 2018, with a rating of "Effective" or "Highly  Effective" in 1.3, where the principal makes, "The use of resources and other organizational decisions are well- aligned...strategic organization decisions to support the school's instructional goals and meet student learning needs,  as evidenced by meaningful student work products." The need in 2018-2019 is for teachers to be able to/know how to  craft their own professional development sessions that are created with the intent of knowing what each other and  how each other best receives development. All of the aforementioned are avenues that were and are in use to help  raise student achievement.          Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.   By December 2018, 100% of teachers will receive (five) tailored professional development sessions and targeted  feedback around how to deliver teacher led professional development sessions geared towards our pedagogy of  Student Centered/Learner Centered Learning with an emphasis on student autonomy. By June of 2019, four  teachers will have worked with representatives from TOURO College on planning and delivering at least one  professional development session that is in alignment with our pedagogy and or instructional focus.  Professional Development Session Feedback forms, inter-visitation feedback forms, and DFFT ADVANCE Data  will be used to measure the effectiveness of professional development.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Liberation as a whole has been through a very rough few years and we have spent a tremendous amount of time  healing as a school community. In 2012-2013 we were totally devastated by Hurricane Sandy. In 2013-2014 we had a  student arrested during Regent exams for murder, another student arrested for setting fire in his building that  ultimately led to the death of a police officer, a student murdered by a retired police officer, and a teacher that many  students admired was removed from the building when we learned of an inappropriate relationship she was having  with a student. In 2014-2015 we started the year with two first year teachers, had a teacher removed pending 3020a  charges, and lost a teacher who had to take an early retirement to care for his grandchildren when his daughter  suddenly died. In addition, we have a few students in and out of rehab/hospitals for substance abuse, students are  angry with the recent events of officers killing unarmed men, and the violence in the community has taken the lives of  many other young people.    We have engaged in many town hall meetings where students and staff were provided a safe place to speak openly  about their feelings in addition to small group and individual conversations to help heal. Both staff and students were  afforded the supports provided by Momentum as a means of community building as well as finding the tools/space to  heal individually and collaboratively. With an entirely new JCCA staff a lot of training and support was provided by the  principal, guidance counselor, and Morningside Center for Teaching Social Responsibility. In addition to individual  counseling, students are receiving weekly social/emotional support in Leadership groups provided by their Advocate  Counselors and Momentum for Teens.    Our school has been instrumental in bringing the Coney Island Community together to form the Coney Island Anti- Violence Coalition. Our students have designed anti-violence posters that are found in stores, buildings and areas  throughout the community and partake in monthly meetings with the coalition. As the momentum to get involved  with community action projects involving saving lives and the environment, the Coney Island Liberated Leaders for C.  H.A.N.G.E. was formed under the supervision of Principal Leong.    The Coney Island Liberated Leaders for Community Helping Neighbors Gain Empowerment (C.H.A.N.G.E.). The  purpose of Coney Island Liberated Leaders is to not only become the change they want to see but empower others in  their community to do the same. This group of young people all have and continue to face hardships in life and are  here at Liberation Diploma Plus High School because they have not experienced success in their prior high schools. For  many of them Liberation is their last opportunity to earn a high school diploma. Coney Island Liberated Leaders  started as just a group of my interns who all decided that the change they wanted to see in their community had to  start with themselves. They have participated and spear-headed in several community initiatives around violence,  bullying, neighborhood beautification, and improving N.Y.P.D. relations.   Coney Island Liberated Leaders has worked very closely with the Coney Island Beautification Project this past year.  They planted daffodils on several different occasions and participated in several beach cleanups. Liberated Leaders  has met with Councilman Mark Treyger and proposed several projects for the beautification of Coney Island   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      playgrounds and parks. We are also planning to create a mural on the side of the school to add to the beautification  of the neighborhood as well as create images on non-violence.   We are very closely aligned with Open Door Arts in Education Project and collaborating in anti-bullying, anti-violence,  community development and female empowerment projects. Students participated in an anti-bullying PSA that has  been shown in high schools around the city. Students have documented their experiences under the “My One  Change” slogan and are currently working on putting together a video.   In addition, Coney Island Liberated Leaders are working very hard to improve N.Y.P.D. and Community relations in  response to the many police involved killings of unarmed young men of color. Specifically in response to the decision  not to indict the officers involved in the Eric Gardner tragedy. What started off as just a basketball tournament with  police officers and young people in the Coney Island community has evolved into a committed partnership between  our youth and the New York City Police Department. The Coney Island Liberated Leaders hosted a dinner of  appreciation for officers after the murders of Detective Ramos and Detective Liu to send a message of appreciation to  officers across the city. We created a fourteen week Junior Citizens Police Academy with Lieutenant Donzel Cleare and  have completed our third successful year. By mimicking the NYPD’s current Citizens Academy that has existed since  1993 our young people will learn about some of the core lessons taught to NYPD recruits. The training methodologies  in the fourteen week course consist of lectures, videos, role plays, tactical exercises and interdisciplinary workshops.  We have enriched this experience with our youth by bringing them through several team building field trips. We have  assisted with the start-up of a similar program in Camden, New Jersey and have replicated the JCPA in two additional  N.Y.C. transfer schools. Upon the completion of the fourteen week academy our desire is to take the team on a road  trip to Montogmery Alabama to meet with members of the Montgomery Police Department along with local youth to  share the work of our JCPA. Our second cohort of JCPA graduates have become JCPA Ambassadors. The Ambassadors  are responsible for presenting workshops to outside entities and supporting their peers who are future candidates for  the JCPA. The JCPA Ambassadors are also now on the calendar at the NYC Police Academy to present classes to NYPD  recruits before their first days of policing communities.    Ultimately the Coney Island Liberated Leaders (JCPA) and members of the New York City Police Department are  changing mindsets together and will develop a blue print to improving community and police relations.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.   By the 2018-9 school year, 100% of Liberated Leaders will develop at least three community events to support the anti- violence initiative and at least two programs to improve their relationships between N.Y.P.D. Attendance and pre/post  surveys will be used to measure our success.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Coney Island Liberated Leaders for C.H.A.N.G.E. will hold a stop  the violence barbecues for the community to bridge the gap  between young and old as they come together for one cause.   Coney Island Liberated Leaders for C.H.A.N.G.E. will put together  an anti-violence art show that will be open to the community.  This event will bring local artists together as well as expose  younger children to art as we spread the anti-violence message.   Coney Island Liberated Leaders will develop a forum where  people from the community (both young and old) will come  together and share stories of transformation as we take a night  to appreciate one another. Our Liberated Leaders will share their  testimonies of how they changed their lifestyles, including but  not limited to gang affiliations) because of their participation as  a Liberated Leader.    After meeting with community members and youth, Liberated  Leaders will develop events to bring the New York City Police  Department together which may include sports activities,  dinners, and conversations.   In collaboration with the N.Y.P.D. our Liberated Leaders with  other select students will complete a fourteen week Junior  Citizen's Police Academy Program.    Our Liberated Leaders also volunteer to assist other Coney Island  organizations with their anti-violence activities and community  based events.           3b – Parent and Family Engagement   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56            IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Liberation Diploma Plus High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Liberation Diploma Plus High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement  level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;  ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning  and decision making in support of the education of their children;  ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support  and monitor their child’s progress;  ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format,  and in languages that parents can understand;  ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to  improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between  parents and other members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of  the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School  Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their  members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the  school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the  implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are  allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting  skills;  ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and  strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team,  the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes  providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership  skills;   ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report,  Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;  ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise  parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their  right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section  1118 and other applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act;  ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of  the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations  and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59                  ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;  ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the  school year;  ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent- Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;  ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;  ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;  ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of  their children’s progress;  ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed  about school activities and student progress;  ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a  format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Liberation Diploma Plus High School in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and  Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of  student achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and  programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will  share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be  developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

Freestanding ENL program.   Our Language Allocation Policy is a school-wide plan designed to address our students who require additional support  services as they progress toward academic proficiency in English. Students receive extra assistance in self-contained  classess in addition to sepcific supports in mainstream classes. We presently do not have ELL students. In the past our  ELL students were Advanced and fluent in English. Students are ungraded since we are a transfer school and this is the  model we follow. Cooperative learning is incorporated into lessons providing students with shared learning  opportunities. As a Diploma Plus school cultural relative curriculum is endorsed which encourages students to bring  their personal experiences into the classroom. The writing and sharing of autobiographical essays also enables  students to connect their cultural backgrounds to the classroom. Prior knowledge is continuously accessed in  class.  Academic language scaffolding is also incorporated into our free-standing ESL program. All of these scientifically  researched based instructional strategies are used to help our ELL students meet state standards and assessments.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A     c.

Our Advanced (A) ESL students receive 1 period per day of Advanced (A) ESL instruction via our AIS zero period. The  Advanced (A) ESL students also receive 1 period per day of English language arts instruction. We currently do not have a  certified ESL teacher so all instruction is delivered via our Special Education Teacher/ ESL Coordinator with assistance of our  Skills Tutor program. We have also used our Rosetta Stone software but have found that our students are far too advanced for  the Rosetta Stone software. Lessons are aligned with state standards and consist of activities that foster both social and  academic growth.  Language functions, structures, usage and vocabulary are part of each lesson. Teacher adapted material is  also used in conjunction with Skills Tutor and Rosetta Stone.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65         3.

(Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  We are focusing our yearly professional development on best practiced ESL strategies and methodologies.  Additionally, we are  presenting the concepts of the Diploma Plus Model and best scaffolding techniques to all our teachers.  The PD is provided via  after-school workshops as well as through on-going support provided by the district ELL Curriculum Instructional Specialist.  All  Pd will be common core aligned. Students who are transitioning into a transfer school for the first time will receive additional  supports from their advocate counselors and social worker. When training is offered our special education teacher will receive  the required amount of professional development and all other staff will continue to receive professional development on  differentiation for ELL/SWDs.All professional development supports are logged by coaches and records are manitained by the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         secretary.

Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The Parent Coordinator and our School Leadership Team are working together to publish a monthly newsletter.  This  newsletter will be translated into other languages and will provide parents, students and staff with pertinent school  information, volunteer opportunities, dates of parent meetings, dates of after school activities and will highlight student  achievement. Our parent coordinator will hold monthly parent meetings with translators present (as needed), and all school  letters will be accessible to the parents in at least English and Spanish. Parents will attend workshops and parent meetings to  further help met their needs. The Urban Neighborhood Corp and Adult Education Office will assist with providing supports for  our parents.  Our Guidance Counselor is an essential part of our school’s admission team and will review the parent survey  form and program selection form during the student’s first interview.  At this interview, the ESL program, LAP policy and the  orientation materials will be presented to the parents and student. The conference will discuss the varying types of services  provided to ELL students such as Dual Language Instruction, Bilingual Education Programs and Freestanding ESL programs.  Parents will be given the choice of picking a program that best serves their child’s need.  This will be reinforced in the form of  letters that are provided to each parent of an incoming student.  Letters will be provided to parents in their native language as  well. A one-on-one interview with the Special Education Teacher and native language translator will assure both parent and  student comprehension. Based on this parent choice and the number of English Language Learners, Liberation currently  provides only a freestanding ESL program. This has been the trend for our first year and is aligned with both parent and  student request.  This admissions conference will also provide an opportunity for the ESL Coordinator to disseminate a copy of  the Language Allocation Policy to all our ELL families.

The writing and sharing of autobiographical essays also enables students to connect their cultural backgrounds to  the classroom. Prior knowledge is continuously accessed in class.  Academic language scaffolding is also incorporated into our free- standing ESL program. All of these scientifically researched based instructional strategies are used to help our ELL students meet  state standards and assessments.     Liberation Diploma Plus High School only provides ELL students with a free-standing ESL program with instruction provided in  English.  The program of study is aligned with New York State’s ESL and ELA curriculum and reflects the states’ learning standards  through instructional practices and proper use of acceptable learning materials such as a variety of reading level texts.

The Advanced (A)  ESL students also receive 1 period per day of English language arts instruction. We currently do not have a certified ESL teacher so  all instruction is delivered via our Special Education Teacher/ ESL Coordinator with assistance of our Skills Tutor program. We have  also used our Rosetta Stone software but have found that our students are far too advanced for the Rosetta Stone software.  Lessons are aligned with state standards and consist of activities that foster both social and academic growth.  Language functions,  structures, usage and vocabulary are part of each lesson. Teacher adapted material is also used in conjunction with Skills Tutor and  Rosetta Stone.     Our diverse student body, which consists of 199 students, is primarily from the immediate community, some of which are second  and third generation immigrants as well as students who have chosen to attend Liberation Diploma Plus High School after having  experienced difficulty adjusting to the traditional learning environment found in many large New York City Comprehensive High  Schools.  The shared commonality for all of our students is that they are overage and want to complete the regular high school  diploma program.            According to the latest available ethnic data, 18.6% are White, 47.67% are Black, 27.91% are Hispanic, 5.81% are Asian or Pacific  Islander, and 0% are American Indian/ Alaskan Native. Approximately 89% of the students are considered economically  disadvantaged, and eligible for free lunch. Additionally, .1% of the students are English Language Learners (ELL), with Spanish as the  dominant language among the vast majority. Of the 2 students identified as ELLs one is a General Education student and one is a  Special Education Student. The attached Allocation Policy Worksheet is a breakdown of ELL data which indicates proficiency levels  by grade for ESL as well as standardized state exams.        Liberation Diploma Plus High School is committed to improve instruction and support efforts directed at our English Language  Learning Students. Through our cooperative Language program we are addressing the needs of our students within the school  building.  Additional support efforts involve:  a)     Standardized Assessments take into consideration student proficiency in native languages (where/when necessary). Providing  assessments in native languages as permitted.  Teachers collaborate with the Special Education teacher and where/when  necessary, produce an in class assessment test that is sensitive to the ELL student’s language obstacles. During State standardized   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      assessments, ELL students will be permitted to take exams using a dual language dictionary according to their native language  (where/when) necessary.  Additional time will also be allowed for our ELL students during these exams. The assessment test for ELL  students (NYSESLAT), will be administered according to state timelines during the month of either March or April.  This exam will be  used to assess the ELL students’ performance and will allow our school to better program for the students’ needs during the  upcoming school year.  Additionally, the school will use these exam results as it reflects and plans for improvement regarding our  ESL program.  Preparing for this exam is done both as part of the regularly scheduled ESL classes and presented during the PM  session AIS courses. We will examine which parts of the NYSELAT students have repeatedly performed poorly on and create plans  of action to increase proficiency in specific areas.    b)     Supportive English Language Arts instruction and SIFE Students.  English teachers and the Special Education Teacher  collaboratively plan focusing literacy support toward all students but in particular toward the ELL and SIFE targeted student  groups.  This instructional classroom includes the principles of our Diploma Plus youth development model, where all students are  provided as safe learning environment.  Although we do not currently have SIFE students, we do have a plan to assist any future  students.  This plan includes support on Literacy skills as well as collaborative one-on-one tutorials with native language teachers  (F-status teachers would be sought).  c)     Collaborative Content Area Instruction.  Our Special Education teacher not only provides professional development in best  practice ESL methodologies but also works collaboratively with each of the content area teachers on lesson development and  assessment materials.  This collaboration assists our ELL group as a whole but more importantly initiates discussion and support for  students individually. Teachers have common meeting time and meet weekly in case conferencing to discuss students and share  best practices.  d)     Guidance and ESL Coordinator After-school services are available to focus on students struggling with English as well as  Students identified with interrupted   e)     formal education.

Within this program, parents, guidance counselors, related service providers,  ESL Coordinator and Special Education teacher collaboratively work toward providing the identified student with the instruction  and educational support necessary to be successful within the ESL and Regents curriculum.  Some strategies include academic  intervention services, one-on-one tutoring, counseling and collaborations among all content teachers.    k)     Long Term ELLs and Extension of Services - Although Liberation did not have students listed as in need of extended services,  our plan is to address these students with specific academic and social support.  ELL students in need of extended services will be  provided with individual counseling from our guidance staff and one-on-one tutorial assistance from both the ESL Coordinator as  well as a certified English Language Arts instructor.  These services will be provided via a PM school support program.   l)     Students Achieving Proficiency – English Language Learners who achieve proficiency and may still require additional support  services. These students will be monitored by both the ESL coordinator and the Guidance Counselor.  Additional Academic  Intervention Services will be supplied both during the regular school day as well as within a comprehensive PM school  program.  Their progress academically as well as on standardized state exams will be monitored for accountability and early  academic intervention.    m)     Professional Development Plan – We are focusing our yearly professional development on best practiced ESL strategies and  methodologies.  Additionally, we are presenting the concepts of the Diploma Plus Model and best scaffolding techniques to all our  teachers.  The PD is provided via after-school workshops as well as through on-going support provided by the district ELL  Curriculum Instructional Specialist.           Summation:  Liberation Diploma Plus High School is pleased to present a comprehensive approach to our English Language Learning program.  Through early identification of students, collaborative planning and preparation, guidance support services, content area courses  infused with ESL methodologies and parent involvement, our school is working diligently on assisting all students as they progress  toward completion of their high school diploma requirements.  Each component of our school is involved in the development,  implementation of and assessment of Liberation’s ESL program.  We are committed to providing quality instruction to all our  students.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, April Leong, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Liberation Diploma Plus HS                                                                              School DBN: 21K728  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
