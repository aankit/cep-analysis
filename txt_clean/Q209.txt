This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of P.S.209 is to provide a creative and meaningful education for all children, including ELL, Inclusion, AIS  and Gifted and Talented students, addressing their needs and talents in a nurturing environment. Standards are  addressed through the continued use of heterogeneous yet flexible grouping, differentiated instruction, integration of  mainstream and gifted students, inclusion of students from District 75, clear and ongoing dialogue with parents, staff  and students as to expectations of achievement. The members of the P.S. 209 community strive to provide  opportunities for academic and social growth in a collegial atmosphere that will move our students toward mastery in  all areas and prepare them for their place in a constantly changing society .    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9         The vision statement of P.S. 209 is in partnership with our parents. We envision our students to be active members  of society where they can implement their learned knowledge and meet the global challenges of an ever changing  world. Students will show kindness to and respect for others based in their strong ethical values and character  development.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.S. 209Q is an elementary school with 620 students. Our student demographics consists of 37% Asian, 1% Black, 19%  Hispanic, and 40% White. We have 5% English Language Learners and 18% students with special needs. Student  attendance and teacher attendance is at 97%.       We have a collaborative inclusion program with P9 (District 75 school) which is also housed in our building. All  classrooms are equipped with technology including Smartboards that teachers utilize in their daily lessons. A school  website provides parents and teachers with resources to help support his/her children’s learning. To support student  research and foster critical thinking, we have a computer lab as well as two movable computer carts for teachers and  students to use.       The PTA, in partnership with our school, subsidizes a school messenger telephone program including phone  messaging and email reminders to alert parents and guardians of all upcoming school wide events and class events.  Our school website also informs our school community of all weekly and monthly events. Parents and guardians can  obtain weekly homework assignments on teachers’ individual class page. As part of our continued parental  engagement, class newsletters, online homework assignments, and teacher created class websites are available to  parents.       There is a music program in our school where our younger children are introduced to music appreciation and reading  of music. Kindergarten and First Grade students learn patterns and rhythms through the use of various musical  instruments. Grade 2 students learn to play the glockenspiel and perform a concert for our Pre K, Kindergarten and  Grade 1 students. Grade 3 students learn to play the recorder and perform a concert for their parents and peers.  Grade 4 and 5 students participate in a school band where they also perform for their parents and peers. Grade 4 also  learns jazz history. We offer extra-curricular activities for children to participate in, such as cheerleading, basketball,  chorus, student council, and reading buddies.     Our school chorus performs several concerts within the school community and Barnes and Noble. The school chorus  also performs at the school for parents and peers. Our students in grades 4 through 5 are given the opportunity to  become monitors. They tutor younger students allowing them to participate in service learning. To have our students  college and career informed, every winter our guidance counselor coordinates a Career Day inviting parents,  guardians and community members to discuss different jobs and responsibilities to our third, fourth and fifth grade  students. For our younger students, we invite the local dental association, police department, fire department, library  and other community organizations to inform students about careers in the community. In the spring, our students’  work is exhibited and showcased in an annual curriculum fair for the community, parents and peers. Students act as  ambassadors and representatives explaining their projects to the visitors.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      We have SWD who are primarily classified as Learning Disabled. They require modified strategies to address their  needs - small groups, individualized instruction and SETss. Our ENL students require push - in and pull - out services  that address their needs.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our school has made progress in the area of inquiry work and collaborative teachers. Teachers are working vertically  as well as horizontally with their colleagues to ensure an appropriate education for all.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 25Q209   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   580   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Based on the Learning Environment Survey, 91% of our parents believe that our school leadership promotes family  and community involvement. 9% of our parents need to be included more into the events of the school community.      Based on Advance reports, school leadership will improve on providing effective feedback to teachers so that they  may design coherent instruction and create lessons which will increase student achievement. More teachers will  move from effective to highly effective as evidenced on the Measure of Teacher Practices.   Based on the feedback from school leadership, teachers will move from effective to highly effective by encouraging  students to extend discussions, challenge one another's thinking, and enriching ideas in reading comprehension. This  will have a direct impact on higher student achievement.       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.    By June 2019, 95% of teachers will continue to improve instructional practices across classrooms to ensure that diverse  learners are consistently provided with challenging tasks enabling them to demonstrate higher order thinking skills as  evidenced by classroom observations. This will provide a 5% increase in the number of students earning a 3 or 4 on the  state assessments.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the  activities and strategies your school will  implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element,  including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be targeted?

Based on the Quality Review Report, “communication with parents was a concern particularly parents of English  Language Learners (ELL).” Even though the school, “has only 80 ELL students, there are many parents who do not  speak English at home and many of the communications that go out to parents are not translated.”   Based on student enrollment, we have noticed that our ENL population is growing predominantly in grades K-2.  Additional resources are needed for these families in order to bridge the communication gap.   According to the Learning Environment Survey, 57% of the parents volunteered time in classrooms and with school  wide events. Sixty four percent communicated with their child’s teacher about their performance.    Increase the use of translators at school meetings and events.

N/A       4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -    -      1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)   Column B   Section Reference(s)  -    -    -    -    -      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 209Q , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Every Student  Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the  connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      [School name] will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students         ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement  level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;  ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning  and decision making in support of the education of their children;  ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support  and monitor their child’s progress;  ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format,  and in languages that parents can understand;  ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to  improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between  parents and other members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36   Parental Involvement and School Quality      The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of  the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School  Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their  members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the  school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the  implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are  allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting  skills;  ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and  strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team,  the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes  providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership  skills;   ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report,  Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;  ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise  parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their  right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section  1118 and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act;  ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of  the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations  and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37         ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the  school year;  ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent- Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;  ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;  ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;  ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of  their children’s progress;  ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed  about school activities and student progress;  ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a  format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Our participating students will receive  home language support from their peers.  The program will begin December 1, 2016.  Students  are strategically placed in roles with peers who speak their native language.  All Kindergarten  students are teamed with an older student who speaks the same native language.  The program  will be offered to all ENL students. The subgroups that will be served are  Newcomer ELLs,  Developing ELLs, Long-Term ELLs, ELLs with Disabilities and former ELLs. The program will  help ENL students build capacity as a community at P.S. 209, as well as build self-esteem,  reduce anxiety and inhibitions and enhance motivation.  We decided to use literacy through  drama as our method of lowering the affective filter for our ENL population.  Through this  program ENL students will have the chance to be noticed, attended to, valued and affirmed.  The  students will be learning & rehearsing dialogue, songs and dances in English.   Students who  participated in the Disney program showed an improvement in their NYSESLAT scores.  Our  scores were as follows:  Twelve (12) students showed a score of Commanding (37.5%).  One  student scored Expanding and received a score of three (3) on ELA; Six (6) students advanced 1  proficiency level; One (1) student advanced 2 proficiency levels.  It has also been observed over  the years, the shyness and fear of using English by students disappears as  a result of their  participation in our Disney productions. The students let their second language guard down and  become less inhibited.  The students tend to relax and stop blocking out the new language.  Changing the students’ perception of the language learning from a negative to a positive is a  major plus for the learning process.  The Disney Production has the potential of making learning  English fun for the students and even memorable because it is interactive and visual.  Drama in  language teaching allows for an improved sense of confidence in the students' ability to learn  English and improve their ELA and NYSESLAT scores.  The play acting provides the  opportunity for a healthy release of emotion in a safe setting which can work to relieve the  tension of learning in a second language.  Therefore, drama has a wider reach than simply making students more fluent in a second  language.  It has the potential of making their lives better as they will be better understood.  Students will be required to maintain a reflection journal of their experiences.  The ENL teacher  will conference with each student and guide them during their reflection time.  The materials will  include a script (for each student) as well as rehearsal CD (with songs) which will be sent home  for the students to practice their lines and songs.  Our school received a Disney grant in the  2009-2010 school year.  Disney teaching artists trained the two general education  teachers.  There will be four teachers and one paraprofessional running the program (1 ELL  teacher, and 2 general education teachers , one music teacher and one paraprofessional).  The  ELL teacher will provide support using ENL methodologies during rehearsals for the targeted  ELL population.   Our goals are to strengthen the students’ self- esteem, listening, reading,  writing and speaking skills so that these skills will carry over to improve students’ listening,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   reading, writing, and speaking  on the NYSESLAT and ELA exmas.

On February 9 will be the  ELA  workshop; On March 9 will be the NYSESLAT workshop and April 6 will be the Math  workshop. Each session will run from 6:30 pm to 8:00 pm.   Parents are free to open discussions  about any other issues of concern.  These sessions will provide information and will better equip  parents to prepare their child for the upcoming state exams.  ELL parents receive a letter in both  English and their home language inviting them to the workshops.  The DOE Translation Unit,  teachers and parents will provide assistance in translation of letters.   Administration, ENL  teacher, Parent Coordinator, and teachers will continue to work hard to ensure that our school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents, resulting in a stronger home-school  relationship. Parent coordinator will also host two sessions where parents will gather  together,  prior to picking up their children from the after-school program to discuss any  upcoming events at P.S. 209Q (interpreters will be available).  Our ENL parents are offered the  opportunity to have all forms of communication translated into their home language.   The New  York City Department of Education has provided a Translation and Interpretation Unit to assist  parents to communicate about their child's  education and any other needs the parents may have.  The Parent Coordinator (Mary Gross) will continue to have a Parent Language Committee  consisting of six parents speaking Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, and Spanish, which are the  majority languages in our school.  Parents from the committee are also available to translate  school correspondence and interpret at PTA meetings, workshops, and Breakfast with the  Principal.  The Parent Coordinator's role is to ensure that all ENL parents receive correspondence  in their home language and are provided with interpreters as needed. The Parent Coordinator also  ensures that all ENL parents' needs and questions are addressed on a timely manner with  interpreters as needed.The Parent Coordinator (Mary Gross) and the ENL teacher (Mrs.  Kamhawy) will oversee a  health and wellness program which will be presented by Power Brain  Education.  This is an interactive introductory workshop for parents.  This community-building  workshop emphasizes core Brain Education exercises and the connection between nutrition and  brain functioning.  The program encourages more active parent participation in school activities  and promotes healthier habits for parents and their children.  Interpreters will be provided within  the program.  There will be three sessions.  A survey will be sent to parents in their home  languages to determine the scheduling of the sessions. Parent Coordinator (Mary Gross) will  send surveys to parents  to assess any further needs they may have.  Based on respones to the  surveys,  parent workshops will be implemented.  Agendas and attendance will be available at  each workshop and will be maintained by the parent coordinator (Mary Gross).       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44        Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We presently assess early literacy skills of ENLs with many different programs; Running Records, Fundations, Performance  Series, ELL Periodic assessments and teacher created assessments.  The data obtained from these assessments is used to  understand each child’s areas of weaknesses and strengths.  Based on the assessment results the teachers will be able to allow  for different points of entry for each student.  This data provides the teachers and the instructional team with valuable  information as to the proficiency level of each ENL student.  The data assists Administration to make decisions as to what  programs and software to purchase and use that would best benefit the ENLs' needs.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teachers hold weekly grade level meetings to discuss students' individual progress and needs.  Content area teachers and  classroom teachers collaborate with ENL teachers to discuss students' ENL levels and progressions.  Based on teachers  discussions changes are implemented by administration and all teachers.  ENL teachers provide and explain to all stakeholders   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      the NYSESLAT scores.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The MOSL results are carefully analyzed and the information is used to guide instruction for ENL students.  The success of our  ENL program is evaluated by comparing the prior year’s results of NYSESLAT, New York State ELA and Math exams to present  year’s results. Comparing Fall and Spring ELL Assessments also helps to evaluate the ENL program. The data is analyzed and  based on the findings; the ENL program is restructured to meet the needs of the ENL population. Conferencing with students is  also used as a summative assessment.    Teacher made assessments are used to identify progress and areas of need.             4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The EDAT report is shared and analyzed by administration and ENL teachers.  ENL teachers will closely analyze EDAT report for  students' levels and note which students are at risk and why.  The findings will be shared with all content and classroom  teachers.  Teachers will then hold both horizontal and vertical meetings to plan on how to close the gap for all ENL  students.  Teachers will implement different interventions to address the levels found on EDAT.  ENL and classroom teachers  will use summative assessments to guide their daily lessons to be sure to meet each student's point of entry.  Programs and  books are purchased based on the needs found from the summative assessments.  Ratio of student to teacher is adjusted also  based on assessments.  Administration will provide professional development according to the teachers' needs.         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    Our school has an AIS program presently in place.  Tier 1 consists of a rigorous instructional core ensuring that each student’s  needs are met on a daily basis.  In Tier 1, core instruction is focused on promoting oral language development using ESL/ENL  methodologies that are culturally and linguistically responsive.  Progress monitoring data (from periodic assessments and  teacher observation/ input) is used to make educational decisions about changes in goals, instruction, and or services. When  Tier I is not appropriately providing for the student, the student is then moved to Tier II.  In Tier II, the student is provided with  increasingly intensive, targeted instruction designed to match his/her learning needs.  If data indicates student is still having  difficulty, the student is placed in Tier III.  Here the student will be receiving intensive and individualized instruction.  Native  language support is provided during Tier I and Tier II when possible.  An ENL student is evaluated for special education when  they do not respond to effective and rigorous instruction and/or additional intervention that is provided with increasing  intensity which is culturally and linguistically appropriate.           6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    The patterns across proficiency levels for the 2016-2017 NYSESLAT revealed  74 % of 41 students tested achieved a Level of  Commanding/Proficiency. The scores are as follows:  In Kindergarten there were 18 students at Commanding.  In first grade,  there were 3 students at Commanding.  In second grade, there were 3 students at Commanding.  In third grade, there were 3  student at Commanding. In fourth grade, there were 2 students at Commanding and in fifth grade, 1 student at Commanding.       The remainder of the students scored the following on the 2015 NYSESLAT:  In Kindergarten 5 students scored Expanding; In  first grade 1 student scored Expanding;  In third grade 1 student scored Emerging; In fourth grade 1 student scored Expanding  and 1 student scored Emerging; In fifth grade 2 students scored Expanding.     This year, September 2015,  A total of 28 students tested NYSITELL.  21 General Ed Kindergarten students; 2 Special Ed  Kindergarten students; 1General Ed in first grade; 1General Ed student in second grade; 1 General Ed student in third grade;  and 2 General Ed students in 4  th   grade.      The scores were as follows:  In Kindergarten 2 students scored Entering; 2 scored Emerging; 5 scored Transitioning; 6 scored   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         Expanding and 8 scored Commanding.  In first grade 1 student scored Commanding;  In second grade 1 student scored  Commanding; In third grade 1 student scored Entering; and in fourth grade 1 student scored commanding and 1 scored  Entering.     (look at ELA and Math results 2017)        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Implement adjustments to our program to make sure we help our students succeed.The ENL teachers will provide Professional  Development (PD) for all  classroom teachers, Paraprofessionals, speech, AIS, OT, and PT.  The PD will educate/ inform all  stakeholders of the results of the NYSESLAT and how to address the individual needs of each ENL student.  The EDAT Analysis  report will be shared with all stakeholders to also be used for addressing all ENL student needs.  ENL teachers will always be  available for ongoing conferencing with all classroom teachers and school special service teachers.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Students receive the New York State ESL/ENL allotted instruction time based on students’ English proficiency levels  (NYSESLAT and NYSITELL).  The ENL teacher/coordinator is in charge of scheduling to assure each student receives the  required allotted time as per CR Part 154.2.  The pull-out students are grouped based on how many minutes they  require in Standalone ENL or Integrated ENL (with ELA or any other content area).  No more than 2 grade levels are  grouped together for pull-out.      We are grouping the following grades for Standalone ENL services:  K & 1  st   grades (.50 units/90 min.); and some 3rd  grade & 4th grade (.75 units/ 135 min.)  We are grouping the following grades for Pull-out ELA/Content ENL services: K & 1  st   grade (.50 units/90 min.); 2   nd   grade & 3rd grade (.50 units/90 min.)  We are also pushing-in to provide ELA/Content ENL services as follows:  push-in to 2 Kindergarten classes 1 unit/180  min. each= 2 units/360 min.  push-in to two 1  st   grade for .50 unit/90 min.= 1 unit/180 min; push-in to 2  nd   grade for .50 units/90 min.; push-in  to 3  rd   grade for .50 unit/90 min.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.            n/a    c.  DL program.  If applicable.            n/a        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                       The entire 209 school community works together to support ENLs' language and literacy  and academic content  development. We use the Freestanding English as a New Language program model to provide all instruction in English using  ESL/ENL methodologies and native language support with ENL peers. A combination of push-in and pull-out models are   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      used.  In the push-in program,  the ENL teacher works collaboratively with the classroom teachers to plan together ensuring  lessons contain both academic subject matter and strategies that help reach ENLs. During content instruction in collaboration  with classroom teacher, the ENL teacher and the content-area teacher equally provide comprehensible content input, and  vocabulary support.  In the pull-out program, ENLs who spend the majority of their day in all-English content instruction are  brought together from various classes (no more than 2 grades) for small group explicit English instruction (Standalone).  In a  pull-out program where ELA/Content is the focus the ENL teacher plans lessons aligned with the classroom teacher so that  similar content and language concepts are taught to foster continuity and congruence with ENLs' learning (differentiated  learning).      We are grouping the following grades for Standalone ENL services:  K & 1st grades (.50 units/90 min.); and some 3rd grade &  4th grade (.75 units/ 135 min.)  We are grouping the following grades for Pull-out ELA/Content ENL services: K & 1st grade (.50 units/90 min.); 2nd grade & 3rd  grade (.50 units/90 min.)  We are also pushing-in to provide ELA/Content ENL services as follows:  push-in to 2 Kindergarten classes 1 unit/180 min.  each= 2 units/360 min.  push-in to two 1st grade for .50 unit/90 min.= 1 unit/180 min; push-in to 2nd grade for .50 units/90 min.; push-in to 3rd grade  for .50 unit/90 min.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.       P.S. 209 ENLs receive academic content area instruction in English using ESL methodology and instructional strategies. These  include scaffolding, teaching academic language (explicit vocabulary instruction) and content, language usage and structures in  context, using visuals, concrete objects, read-alouds, and variety of print and digital resources. Teachers model academic  language and consistently use spiraling strategies so that language skills grow increasingly more complex. Vocabulary,  language usage and structures are incorporated into every lesson.  Teachers have both content and language objectives  incorporated in every unit of study.  Native language books in appropriate age and grade levels are available in the ENL  classroom.  Langenscheidt word for word dictionaries,  NYS glossaries are also used for additional native language  support.  Parents are invited to do read-alouds in native languages to continue to strengthen students' native languages.  We  are presently using MacMillan for ELLs; National Geographic videos with text; ReadyGen; Go Math technology;  Great Leaps  and Fundations.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      All state exams are in students' native language (except for ELA).  If a student's language is not available in a translated  version the student is given the English version and is provided with a translator.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a)We presently do not have any SIFE students.  Our plan for SIFE students would be as follows: deficits and strengths in  language acquisition and skills in other academic areas would be assessed; based on assessment; instruction would be  differentiated and adapted to meet the needs of each student. Instruction using the Wilson/Fundations program would be  provided to enhance letter /sound recognition.  Peer tutoring and cooperative learning techniques among other strategies  would be implemented to facilitate language acquisition and usage.  At-risk resource services are also available.  Through  technology (PixWriter3 Program) SIFE students would have the opportunity to demonstrate their writing abilities through  pictures/words.  This program provides students with the feeling of accomplishment and empowers them to want to write.      b) Although a newcomer is identified under the CR Part 154 as an ENL student who has received a total of zero to three years   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      of ENL/ESL services; many of our newcomers scored at Emerging, Transitioning or higher.  A newcomers group is formed for all  newcomers. This group not only provides students with accelerated learning through a focus on literacy, native language  supports, and intensive ESL/ENL and content area learning, but also acculturates them to their new city and country. The  newcomers group helps accelerate students’ transition with an intensive support structure; facilitates assessment and  placement; builds background knowledge; and advises students about life in the City.  Native language support is provided  whenever possible (parents, student teachers and staff members that speak appropriate language).     c)We presently have two students who are Developing.  They are both in a 12-1-1 class, they will be receiving  ENL services and  will be serviced according to their IEPs.  These students are given the opportunity to attend the after school Title III ENL  program.  They are also working one-to-one with Learning Leaders.     d)At the present time we do not have any long term ENLs. Academic Intervention Services (AIS) would be provided to meet the  needs of long term  ENLs. These students would be in need of additional assistance to acquire academic language necessary to  meet the state standards in English Language Arts, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies.  Instruction for academic content  in native language whenever possible.  Instruction is delivered by providing the ENL student with comprehensible input.  This is  provided through techniques such as the use of visual aids, modeling, demonstrations, graphic organizers, vocabulary  previews, explicitly vocabulary instruction,predictions, adapted texts, cooperative learning, peer tutoring, mutli-cultural  content, and native language support (when possible).  Teachers provide a non-threatening environment allowing the students  to feel comfortable taking risks with language and providing positive praise.   Connections are made between the content  being taught and students’ experiences and prior knowledge.  Extensive time is spent on understanding vocabulary words.  Guidance and support would be provided for Long Term ENLs who are experiencing affective domain issues that impair their  ability to achieve academically. P.S. 209 would provide for Long Term ELLs through Learning Leaders, Wilson, and  differentiated classroom instruction.  Our support staff of teachers (ESL, SETSS, IEP, AIS Providers) would push into classrooms  with targeted ENLs to reduce student-teacher ratio and provide teachers with strategies to differentiate instruction. Provide  instruction for academic content in native language whenever possible.    e)All former ENLs continue to receive academic support and modifications for two years at 90 minutes per week, after  attaining commanding/proficiency.  All former ENLs continue to receive extended time, separate location; bilingual  dictionaries and glossaries; simultaneous use of English and alternative language exam editions; oral translation for lower  incidence languages; and writing responses in the native language.   Test accommodations for ENLs and former ENLs are extended time, separate location; bilingual dictionaries and glossaries;  simultaneous use of English and alternative language exam editions; oral translation for lower incidence languages; and  writing responses in the native language.  Special Education ENLs receive testing accommodations according to their specific  needs as documented on their Individual Educational Plan (IEP).       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    The ESL/ENL teacher provides instruction for academic content in native language whenever possible.  Instruction is delivered  by providing the ELL-SWD student with comprehensible input.  This is provided through techniques such as the use of visual  aids, modeling, demonstrations, graphic organizers, vocabulary previews, explicit vocabulary instruction, predictions, adapted  texts, cooperative learning, repetition, peer tutoring, mutli-cultural content, and native language support (when  possible).  Teachers provide a non-threatening environment allowing the students to feel comfortable taking risks with  language and providing positive praise.   Connections are made between the content being taught and students’ experiences  and prior knowledge.  Extensive time is spent on understanding and utilizing vocabulary words.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Within our school we make allowance for our students to be educated in the least restricted environment in the subject areas  where they demonstrate academic strengths.  The ELL-SWDs can be mainstreamed several periods within the day when  applicable.  This flexible scheduling enables our ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency within the  least restrictive environment.  This conforms with the Special Education Reform.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   The targeted intervention programs for ENLs are available for all content areas.  At-risk resource is available for ELA, Social  Studies, Science and Math.  The classroom teachers provide small group targeted interventions as needed.  The resource room  teacher also provides targeted instruction for at risk ESL/ENL students in all content areas (ELA, Social Studies, Science and  Math).  At-risk speech is also available for language and speech. Learning Leaders utilize the Great Leaps program for phonetic  instruction. Fundations/Wilson programs are implemented for letter/sound recognition. Native language support is provided  whenever possible (parents, student teachers, books).      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      In terms of improvements/new programs for the upcoming school year we are presently researching several computer based  programs such as Achieve 3000 and Study Island.  We are also in the process of renewing our contract with RazKids and  implementing the ENL specific RazKids component  (also a computer based program).  For math we are looking to implement  the Math Personal Trainer (MPT) which is a home-support computer based math program (Go Math). We will continue to  provide our ENLs with access to books on tape, laptops/I-pads for Internet usage, Ready-Gen,  MacMillan ELL reading program,  big books with rhyming  listening cds, story readings by adults in native language, and books in native languages.   For the  2017-2018 we will be implementing Marzano's six step vocabulary program (Teachers were trained by the Marzano Institute  June 2017)     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   n/a       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ENLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.  All ENL parents are notified in their native language of all upcoming  events.  in 2017-2018 an after school program will be offered to all ENLs through Title III.   This is a literacy through drama  program.  ENL students have the opportunity to read, sing, dance, and speak their parts during the performance.  A production  is performed in the spring.  All parents receive an invitation for the performance in both English and native language.  This  program provides the ENL students with the opportunity to communicate in a non threatening and fun environment while  enhancing their social skills.   We will continue to provide our ENLs with access to books on tape, laptops/I-pads for internet usage, Ready-Gen,  MacMillan  ELL reading program, big books with rhyming, books on cds, story readings by adults in native language, and books in native  languages.          12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  ELLs are provided with access to books on tape, Go Math on line resources (in Spanish) laptops/I-pads, for Internet usage,  smart boards, Raz-Kidz (online guided reading program specific for ENLs),  MacMillan ENL reading program, big books with  rhyming, read alouds, listening cds, story readings by adults in native language, and books in native languages.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is provided in our ENL program whenever possible.  We have Chinese volunteer parents who translate  for our students and parents. We also have an ELA teacher and a technology teacher that give native language support for  Spanish speaking students as needed. Native language support is provided during cooperative learning through discussions  with peers speaking same language.  We provide home language support using translation services.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All services and instructional materials correspond to students’ ages and grade levels.  The programs that are chosen are  developmentally appropriate and enhance grade level skills and strategies. All Students including ELL-SWDs are grouped  according to their grade levels.  There is a two grade span within any group.  Students within each group are taught based on  their language and cognitive ability and IEP needs.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    n/a     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   All new students are given a tour (by the ESL/ENL teacher) of the school building and introduced to the different cluster  teachers.  A teacher, paraprofessional, student teacher or parent provides support for this tour in the student’s native  language. An ENL student is given a buddy that speaks his/her native language to assist them until they are familiar with their  new surroundings.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    n/a      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   n/a     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   This year great effort will be placed on training teachers how to improve on their co-teaching skills. We will continue to  educate all classroom teachers, Assistant Principals, paraprofessionals, Guidance counselors, Psychologists, speech therapists,  occupational/physical therapists, secretaries and parent coordinator on the basic principles of language acquisition.  All  classroom teachers and other teaching personnel (mentioned above) will be provided with extensive professional  development. The ESL/ENL teacher will articulate and model principles of effective instruction for ELLs through co-teaching  and professional development opportunities. ESL/ENL, classroom teachers and support staff will also attend workshops to  emphasize Balanced Literacy techniques to use with ENLs. Ongoing professional development is provided by the ESL/ENL  teacher at grade conferences and during professional development periods (also on a one-to-one basis as needed). During  these periods, classroom teachers, Assistant Principal, paraprofessionals, Guidance counselor, psychologists,  occupation/physical therapists, speech therapists, secretaries and parent coordinator are taught techniques on how to work  with and be sensitive to ENLs’ needs. Teachers are trained to know the basic principles of second language literacy instruction,  understand second language acquisition and cross-cultural contexts, and provide ENLs with content-based instruction using  comprehensible input.  The staff is informed on the importance to include native language support whenever possible. The  calendar of PD dates for current year is as follows:  CR Part 154 (Sept); Co-teaching (Nov); Different stages of an ENL student during language acquisition (Dec); Teaching  Rigor/DOK to ENLs (Jan); How to scaffold for ENLs (Feb); Explicit vocabulary instruction (March);  Introduction to Marzano's  Vocabulary program follow-up webnars (in house training completed June 2017) (Sept-Oct); What are the tools for  differentiation for ENLs (May); How to use the tools for differentiation (June);       ENL teachers will attend meetings that are held monthly through the "News & Opportunities for  Educators of ELLs."  ENL teacher will also attend all meetings scheduled for ENL teachers through the District office.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  ENL parents are provided information about middle school in both English and their preferred language by the guidance  counselor. The guidance counselor provides parent workshops to assist ENL parents with the transition.  Translators are  provided at the workshops. The guidance counselor (Mrs. Falzone) attends meetings of which she turns-key with staff in  regards to middle school application transition/process. The guidance counselor is available for conferencing with all teachers  in regards to middle school applications.  Mrs. Falzone co-teaches with classroom teachers with regards to explaining the  middle school process to students.  Mrs.  Falzone assists classroom teachers with any parental concerns that may arise  regarding the middle school process.    To meet the professional development (PD) requirements as per CR Part 154.2:  15% of total hours for all teachers and 50% of  total hours for ENL teachers will receive ELL-specific professional development; we will provide Professional Development  beginning September, once a month for one hour.  There will be a sign-in sheet available to maintain records of all meetings  that have been conducted.  Some professional developments: New regulations of CR Part 154 (Sept); Co-teaching (Nov);  Different stages of an ENL student (Dec); Teaching Rigor/DOK to ENLs (Jan); How to scaffold for ENLs (Feb); Explicit vocabulary  instruction (March);  Translations and Interpretation(April); What are the tools for differentiating for ENLs (May); How to use  the tools for differentiating (June);   Records for professional development activities are kept through Attendance sheets/sign-in sheets and minutes.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   ENL teacher will call and schedule appointments with parents that wish to meet to discuss their children's progress. A  translator will always be available during the meetings.  If a parent is unable to come in,  a phone conference with translation  unit will be scheduled.  There are several ENL meetings throughout the school year.  There is the orientation meeting; State  Exam meeting; Meet the teacher meeting; and a progress meeting that will be implemented for 2017-2018 school year.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   In September an orientation is provided to all ELL parents.  Follow-up for non-attending parents is performed by the Parent  Coordinator and ESL/ENL teacher (phone calls with interpreters and translated follow-up letters are sent).  During the meeting  the parents are informed of Title III, CR part 154 and any other services that their children are entitled to receive. Parents are  invited to attend Parent Conferences and individual conferences and are notified that translators in their native language will  be available.  Materials and notifications are available in parents’ native languages.   Workshops will be conducted by the  ESL/ENL teacher to inform ENL parents about the all state exams.  This year we are hoping to receive (again) the grant from  The Center For Arts Education.  We are hoping to involve our ENL parents in this wonderful program. The Parents as Arts  Partners program engages parents and children in hands-on collaborative arts learning.  We hope to have parents join us who  can assist in translations during the program.  The parent coordinator has also created a group of parents who can translate for  our newcomer parents.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Mary E. McDonnell, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Clearview Gardens                                                                              School DBN: 25  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
