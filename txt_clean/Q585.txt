This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Maspeth High School, The Classical School of New York City, implements a classical, college-preparatory curriculum.   Our mission: “We implement a classical liberal arts and sciences, college preparatory curriculum that will train our  students to become critical thinkers and life-long learners with strong character.”   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Our vision: “To have our students become leaders in all fields of personal endeavors through academia and to be  physically, emotionally, and intellectually healthy with determination and compassion.”   Our core values: truth, beauty and goodness.                  .                2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Maspeth High School's Classical education model is a language-intensive and inquiry-centered approach to education  that has existed for over 2,500 years and has produced great minds such as Socrates, Copernicus, Galileo,  Shakespeare, Goethe, Newton and Einstein. Maspeth High School teachers focus on helping students to develop skills  such as reading, writing, public speaking, problem solving, and computation. With a focus on inquiry-based authentic  learning, our students are taught to question their world. Maspeth High School students set only the highest  expectations for themselves - academically, physically and socially.   Maspeth High School students participate in Socratic seminars, debates, and declamations across all disciplines. The  majority of Maspeth students are on track to complete four years of fine arts classes (visual art, theater, string  orchestra, chorus, or ballet) as well as four years of either Mandarin or Latin.    Maspeth High School has many strategic partnerships designed to enhance the high school experience for our  students. These partnerships include Saint John's University, the Julliard School, Broadway Open Doors, the Theater  Development Fund, the Alvin Ailey Dance Foundation, and Syracuse University. Maspeth High School has previously  partnered with the Hangzhou Foreign Language School in a teacher exchange program in the past and is currently  researching options for either renewing this partnership or initiating a similar program with another foreign school.  Each year the school evaluates the benefits of the aforementioned partnerships to determine whether these  programs have benefited our students and should be renewed.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Maspeth High School currently serves an English Language Learner population that is 3% of our overall enrollment.  The population of Students With Disabilities is approximately 16.5%.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Maspeth High School's School Leadership team meets monthly to design and revise the school's goals for each year.  The School Leadership Team conducts an evaluation of school data at the conclusion of each school year which  includes the following data points: New York States Regents exam results, Advanced Placement exam results,  graduation results, student progress toward graduation, interim assessment results, New York City Department of  Education School Survey results, attendance records, and prior New York City Department of Education School Quality  Review Report and School Quality Snapshot results.    As of October 2018, Maspeth High School was designated as an Exemplary High Performing School by the National  Blue Ribbon Schools Program (United States Department of Education) for it's ability to demonstrate that all students  can achieve at high levels. Also in 2018 Maspeth High School was once again named as a Silver Medal School by the  U.S. New and World Report.    Maspeth High School's many achievements directly correspond to the culture of collegiality and dedication among the  teachers at the school . Maspeth High School was founded on a collaborative leadership model, and many teachers at  the school assume leadership responsibilities: Department Leaders, Grade Level Leaders, Coordinator of Student  Activities, Transition Team Leader, Advisory Coordinator, IEP Coordinator, ENL Coordinator, among many others.  Additionally, teacher teams work collaboratively to design school programs, such as advisory, and to refine the  curriculum.    Maspeth High School's area of focus for the 2018-19 school year is Strong Family and Community Ties. The school's  administration will continue to work collaboratively with the Parent-Teacher Association, the School Leadership Team  and stakeholders to ensure that parents receive timely communication in their preferred language, and are given  multiple opportunities to engage with the school in a meaningful way.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 24Q585   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1196   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39     State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Formative assessments are used as homework assignments, in addition to being used throughout the class period.  Our school  has a variety of assessment practices which are used throughout the content areas.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Our school prides itself on its collaborative teacher teams consisting of department meetings, and grade level meetings.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45        Our school's ENL program functions mainly as an integrated program within the content area of ELA.  Therefore, we focus on  the ELA Common Core Regents, NYSESLAT,  ELA interim assessments, and Socratic Seminars to guide our planning and  progress relating to literacy, and writing, and to assess  9th grade: We use scores from students’ 8th  grade ELA exam, and 8th grade NYSESLAT to assess literacy levels before we  begin to assess them during the school year.  Our English Interim Assessments also help us to evaluate literacy levels, as they  are mainly reading comprehension exams.  Other more creative summative assessments used in 9th grade are film projects,  board game creation, and text parodies.    10th grade: We use scores from students’ 9th grade NYSESLAT, and 9th grade ELA Interim Assessments to evaluate literacy  skills as they begin their 2nd year of High School.  We also start preparing them for the ELA common core Regents so practice  exams help us to identify baseline reading and writing levels, and to assess areas of growth needed.  Another summative  assessments used in 10th grade is a research project in conjunction with the reading of Night.    11th grade: We use scores from students’ 10th grade NYSESLAT and 10th grade ELA Interim Assessments to evaluate literacy  skills as they begin their 3rd year of High School.  This year's juniors also took the ELA common core Regents during their  sophomore year.  The scores from this exam will help us plan our instruction as well.  Other summative assessments used in  11th grade include a book theme party with research components in conjunction with reading The Great Gatsby, and a trial  where students are assigned court roles and must use evidence from the text to argue their side.    12th grade: We use scores from the students’ 11th grade NYSESLAT, 11th grade ELA Interim Assesssments, and the ELA  Regents to assess literacy skills as they begin their 4th year of High School.  Other summative assessments include a research  paper, and personal narrative in preparation for college essays.    Other content area assessments: All content areas give 4 interim assessments per year.  In addition, the history department  uses debates as a key assessment tool at the end of each unit.  The science department also uses practice regents exams to  identify baseline levels, and progress.  They also use lab reports, and research projects to assess students.    SWD’s: ELLs who have IEPs are also tested using the Test of Reading Comprehension (TORC), and the Woodcock-Johnson  intelligence test.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The data shows that the ELLs in our school vary in their literacy levels, and achievement on state Regents exams. Instructional  supports must be in place for those students who fall below grade level norms.  Extended learning, or academic intervention classes are in place for students who do not receive passing scores on state  Regents exams.  We also have a Regents academy program to help students prepare for exams in January, June, and August, in  addition to the support they are already receive in the classroom.  At the classroom level,  ELLs at lower literacy levels are provided with supplemental material to aid them in their  understanding of curricular texts.  We also provide adapted version of the books within the 9th grade curriculum.  We will also  be focusing on consultancy protocols for literacy concerns within our 10th grade cohorts.    As stated previously, department and grade level meetings give us opportunities to discuss steps  for                         interventions and help us to plan our instruction to meet the needs of all students.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   NA      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46           Question 6:  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL  programs? [Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    As mentioned previously, the NYSESLAT and ELA Regents are the main assessments used to  evaluate and inform ELL  programs. As a whole, NYSESLAT data indicates that ENL service is helping most students achieve language proficiency.  It also  reveals that students with IEPS have a more difficult time achieving proficiency which could be a result of their learning  disabilities which causes deficits in reading and writing.  The NYSESLAT 2017 data reveals that 12 of our ELLs increased in proficiency level, or tested out, 13 stayed at the same  proficiency level, and 2 decreased in level.  For the majority of the students, this shows that ENL service is helping to support  their language development. Of the students whose levels remained the same 100% of them also have IEPs.  Therefore, we  can conclude that their learning disabilities, and speech and language impairments are also factors in their performance on the  NYSESLAT.  The 2 students who decreased in levels are Freshmen who also have IEPs.  Through the collaborative nature of our  teacher teams, we will work to support the various needs of our students.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Structures for NYSESLAT:  The ELL coordinator has access to to NYESLAT results, and organizes students based on grade level  and units of service required per English proficiency level.  She works with the programming staff in order to ensure proper  placement of students in classes.    Structures for English Regents:  Students are placed in ELA classes based on the results of the Regents.  Students who don't  receive a passing score upon their first time taking the exam are placed in classes with more emphasis on the exam, and  providing students with the additional support in order to pass it.  The ENL teacher has also provided small group instruction to  students who need further practice and guidance in developing the skills need to pass the exam.  As mentioned previously, a Regents academy program is also in place.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   •   We offer both Integrated ENL and Stand-Alone ENL services.  The ENL teacher co teaches in 4-5 ELA content area  classes to support ELLs in grades 9-12.  When Stand-Alone services are needed for lower proficiency level students,  the ENL teacher creates a rotating schedule to ensure that the student is not being pulled from the same content area  class daily.  •   Students are grouped homogeneously by cohort based on ELA, Math, and Regents scores as well as grade level and  travel together throughout the day.  The arts, phys ed, and foreign language classes are sometimes grouped with  mixed grade levels.   ELLs are distributed among various cohorts, and our ELA classes are comprised of mixed  proficiency levels ranging from Emerging to Commanding.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     NA     c.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?    • We utilize the Free Standing ENL Program and students receive all instruction in English with native language support when  necessary. New York State Commissioner's Regulations Part 154 determines how many units of ENL instruction each student  should receive according to his/her proficiency level from the NYSESLAT score or according to the NYSITELL score.  Currently  we only have Emerging, Transitioning,  Expanding, and Commanding level students.• Emerging learners receive 360 minutes of  ENL instruction per week.  The student at this level is supported in an individual Stand-Alone model, and in an Integrated  model within the ELA content area daily. The ENL teacher co teaches in a class of approximately 30 consisting of gen Ed, ELL,  and IEP students.  Additional minutes of instruction are received during an ENL resource period, where the ENL teacher pushes  into one to two content area classes throughout the week.  • Transitioning learners receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week.  The transitioning students are supported in an  Integrated Model where the ENL teacher co teaches in an ELA class.• Expanding learners receive 180 minutes of ENL  instruction per week.  The expanding students are supported in an Integrated model where the ENL teacher pushes into the  ELA content area classes. Classes consist of gen Ed, ELL, and IEP students. • Commanding learners receive 90 minutes of ENL  instruction per week.  The commanding students are supported in an Integrated Model where the ENL teacher pushes into ELA  classes or other content areas during an ENL resource period      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   • Through our ENL program (We do not have TBE, or DL), our staff works collaboratively to differentiate instruction and  implement scaffolding strategies. • The ENL and content area teachers engage in co teaching 4-5 periods per day. They meet  1-2 times  per week to co-plan.  Daily emailing occurs as well to ensure uniformity  as well as consistency in the delivery of  instruction to ELLs that is aligned with the Common Core Standards. • Other instructional strategies utilized are providing  visual support, increasing background knowledge, building meaningful vocabulary, modelling, using graphic organizers,  chunking text, engaging in close reading, allowing for multiple entry points through collaborative annotation, and  forming  cooperative learning groups so that peers can help each other.  Materials that are used are reading guides which provide  summaries of various books as well as vocabulary words and definitions, smart boards for visual support and  structure,  adapted texts, the Academic Vocabulary Toolkit, and the Pearson Keystone series (stand alone ENL only).     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   • We provide ELLs glossaries in their native languages in each of the content areas.• When applicable students use translated  Regents Exams as a resource during testing.  If the exam is not available in a particular language, we have hired translators to  provide service during testing.  A Polish translator has been used with one of our former students.• The ENL teacher has  Spanish language books in her classroom that are available for students to borrow.• Students at lower levels of language  proficiency are also encouraged to write in their  native language during free writes.  If the student shares his or her responses,  a classmate has helped with the translation so that the entire group understands the response.• We also now offer Mandarin  as a foreign language options.  One of our Commanding ELLs as well as some former ELLs have the opportunity to show their  skills in their native language on a daily basis.  • Our ELLs with IEPs are also sent for bilingual evaluations for triennial reviews.         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      A. Of our current ELLs, none of them have been identified as SIFE. (may need to update)•   For the future we will implement  the following plan for SIFE:•   These students will need literary and academic help in order for them to gain academic  growth. •   Students will be provided reading material at levels both below and above their ability which is necessary to help  make the reading process less intimidating at first.  When students begin to feel successful, they will be able to move  up.  •   Phonics programs will be essential to the literacy process as well.  Differentiation and scaffolding will be present  throughout instruction.   •   An after school program to specifically target these students in order to catch them up should be  established.    B.  Currently we don't have any Newcomers.  For the future we will implement the following plan: •   Students receive 2- 3  periods of ENL instruction daily. •   After school and lunch time tutoring is available. •   Scaffolding strategies are incorporated  into each lesson. •   Students are using the Keys to Learning series to build basic English communication skills and knowledge  of various vocabulary and grammar topics.  The Building Bridges series focuses more on developing students’ cognitive  academic language, through reading comprehension, and content vocabulary acquisition. •   Texts and other resources are  adapted to enhance comprehension of the material.    C. Our plan for Developing Students:•   In addition to providing the instructional strategies mentioned in the previous section,  students are encouraged to attend teacher office hours for tutoring.  In the subjects where they excel, students serve as  leaders during pair work with lower level students.  Explaining the material to their peers helps to reinforce their  understanding.    D. Our long term ELLs are also Special Education students.  They are in integrated co- teaching classes and are being supported  by the ENL teacher, special education teacher, and content area teacher in ELA.  •   This model allows all teachers involved in  their education to confer on the progress of these long term Ells, which is another step toward meeting their individual  needs.  •   Some of these students also have other related services such as Speech and Language Therapy, and counseling.    E. Our plan for former ELLs:•   The ENL teacher provides Integrated ENL instruction within the ELA content area for most of our  Commanding ELLs.  She also checks in on the progress of former ELLs during  designated ENL resource periods.  •   These  students continue to come to office hours when they need help after school or during lunch.•   These students still receive  testing accommodations on state exams.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   There are 24 ELLs who also have IEPs in our school.      •   As previously mentioned all students are currently in Integrated Co-teaching classes where they are supported by multiple  educators. •   In larger classes students are occasionally divided into homogeneous groups to ensure that their individual  needs are being met and that the teacher can provide substantial support.  •   All students are interacting with grade level  material across the content areas.  Teachers utilize various strategies to make that material accessible.  Classes use leveled  readings to ensure students with lower proficiency are able to access the grade level curriculum using simplified vocabulary  and increased visual aids.  ELL-SWDs are given increased opportunities to practice new vocabulary through UDL designed  lessons.  These include and are not limited to, student choice in showing understanding such as drawing or creating word  webs.  Vocabulary quizzes include both content-specific and tier II vocabulary found in academic subjects.•   Other strategies  used include scaffolding techniques which include modeling, using graphic organizers, and individualized conferencing when  possible. Teachers monitor students' progress and provide tutoring  for students during lunch periods and after school. •   The  special education department uses iPads and apps for aid visualizing new concepts and vocabulary.  For example, in science  classes students have access to an interactive cell app which helps students see and name cell organelles.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The least restrictive environment for our ELLs with IEPs is the ICT setting.  The students are held accountable for grade level  material with the support of multiple educators, different approaches, and scaffolding techniques to make it accessible.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  • All ELLs in ELA are supported by the ENL teacher, who is involved in the daily instruction, and collaborates with the general  education teacher to make material accessible for the ELL population.• All ELL subgroups are encouraged to see teachers for  extra help during lunch and after school hours.  Each teacher in the school has at least one day per week of office hours, and  many work with students multiple days during the week.• As stated previously Regents Academy will be offered in preparation  for all Regents exams in January, June and August.• All ELL subgroups in Math are also encouraged to see teachers for extra  help during lunch and after school.  As mentioned previously, Extended learning or Academic Intervention classes are put in  place for students who don't receive a passing score on any of the core state Regents.• All intervention services are offered  mainly in English.  The ENL teacher and a few Special Education English teachers are able to communicate with students in  Spanish to clarify concepts, and assignments.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Literacy programs and coaching options will be explored to address current concerns.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   NA       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  •   ELLs at Maspeth High School are provided equal access to school-wide programming and extra-curricular activities.  All clubs  and sports are visually advertised around the school with fliers and posters.  There was also a club fair at the beginning of the  school year during which students were able to visit each club’s table to find out more information about it with the school's  ELL coordinator on-hand to assist with any questions.  Maspeth High School's ELL coordinator has established a visual footprint  within the school, and both students and teachers are highly aware of the supports and services available for English Language  Learners through frequent communications.•   The role of the ELL coordinator in curricular and extra-curricular activities:- Provide integrated and stand alone ENL to all ELL students-Provide after school assistance (office hours) to all ELL students- Consult with all teachers and provide professional development presentations regarding teaching ELL students and cultural  awareness-Consult with all teachers regarding supports and accommodations for ELLs-Consult with club advisers and coaches  to provide necessary supports and help increase recruitment of ELLs-Provide assistance to ELL students during school-wide  activities, such as Maspeth High School's annual club fair       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  • Smartboards are used in all classrooms to provide optimal visual representation of content material for all ELL subgroups.    • Video clips are sometimes used in ICT classes which include all ELL subgroups to target visual learners.  They enable students  to review concepts through a different medium• Bilingual glossaries, graphic organizers, and English Language Learners  dictionaries are also used.  Tablets and IPads are also available to students for translation and learning apps.• ALL ELL  subgroups have also received adapted versions of lengthier and more challenging ELA texts to enhance their understanding. •  Supplementary material such as text summaries and vocabulary guides are also provided. • As previously mentioned, the Keys  to Learning, and Building Bridges textbook series have been used with lower proficiency students.  The Academic Vocabulary  ToolKit is also used among all ELL subgroups.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   • Our school only offers the ENL program model.• Home language support is provided by the ENL teacher when appropriate  and beneficial to student understanding.  There are several other staff members who also speak languages other than English  to assist students when necessary.• Student pairing with peers of the same language background also helps to provide  translation for ELLs that may be struggling.• Bilingual glossaries are provided in content areas where available.• ELLs have   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         access to literature in Spanish in the library as well as the ENL classroom. Latin language electives also build upon the Spanish  language.• Our school’s  Mandarin program also offers home language support for Chinese students.                   14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All material, and resources for ELLs are targeted for the High School Level.  All of our ELLs are placed in grade appropriate  classes for their ages, and are supported within the grade level content.  A couple of our ELLs are a little older for their grade  based on the credits they accumulated in their home countries not transferring to meet requirements in New York.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Maspeth High School shares it's location with the John F. Kennedy Jr. School (Q721), which is part of District 75. Both schools  collaborate when possible to best utilize shared spaces, and to support the programs of the other school. Last year,  Maspeth High School created an opportunity to increase our students' interactions with their peers at the John F Kennedy  Junior school through Best Buddies. Maspeth High School also routinely shares resources and creates opportunities for our  teachers to collaborate with their colleagues in our neighboring school.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   • Our school has a very small population of ELLs, with only a few new admits requiring ENL service in the past few  years.   There haven’t been programs specifically for them in place before the beginning of the school year.  Our schools’ staff  has conducted open houses to provide incoming students with information about the school, and we will hold a freshmen  orientation on August 30th. The ELL identification process has assisted newly enrolled students and their families to  understand their options and programs available to them.  • The ENL teacher facilitates activities during class time throughout  the year that helps to acclimate newly enrolled students to the school community, and country.   She has utilized a game  developed by a bilingual social worker that specifically focuses on immigrant youth and their transition to a new country.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We currently offer Latin, Mandarin, and Ancient Greek.             18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   NA     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  • As PD opportunities become available, the administration disseminates the information and teachers are able to register  based on their needs and interests for outside professional learning opportunities. • Teachers also have access to search for  various opportunities.  The ENL coordinator/teacher is part of the DOE ELL list-serve which provides information about  upcoming professional development. • Professional development also occurs within school during grade level and department  meetings (both meet 1X per week).   Some of the topics covered have been mindset, questioning strategies, literacy strategies,  motivation, creating effective mastery objectives, and analyzing data.  Each week (Friday) during grade level meetings, one   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         teacher presents on a topic of his or her choice.  The ENL coordinator has presented on the challenges faced by ELLs with on  demand writing tasks, and academic vocabulary, and will continue to present on aspects of ELL education.  Department  meetings occur on Monday (History, Arts, Science), Wednesday (Languages Other Than English), and Thursday (English, Math,  Instructional Support Services, which includes paraeducators) after school.  Guidance Counselors, Social Workers,  Psychologists meet Wednesday's 7 th  period.  Our school's secretaries have had training on ELL compliance reports  in ATS.  Cabinet meetings occur the second Thursday of each month and include department leaders, deans, assistant  principals, and the coordinator of student activities.  Our school does not have a set calendar of PD's as they are ongoing  throughout our weekly and monthly meetings.   There are also two Chancellor's conference days left for the school year  (February 2 nd , and June 9 th ) which can be used for PDs for all ELL personnel.  • The ENL teacher has attended multiple  professional developments outside the school regarding the instruction of English Language Learners.  She serves as a turnkey  during grade level meetings, as well as in individual planning meetings with co-teachers to present various strategies that  benefit ELLs.• The ENL teacher and Special Education coordinator have also collaborated on a resource packet for all teachers  who teach ELLs and SWD’s.  • The ENL teacher and members of the Special Education Department have also participated in the  Arts department meetings to collaborate on test modification.• Teachers at our school also serve as mentors to newly  appointed teachers or those teachers who feel that they can still benefit from some structured guidance.  The mentors  observe and meet with their mentees on a weekly basis • New teachers attend an orientation before the school year begins as  well.                                                             • The ENL teacher has attended several professional opportunities outside of the  school through the DOE.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  • Our school places a high priority on helping students become comfortable with changes in their academic lives.  • The  transition to high school can be challenging and is often intimidating. • To alleviate parent and student concerns, open houses  have been conducted to provide important information about high school requirements. • We currently have 2 guidance  counselors (one is bilingual),  a bilingual social worker, and a psychologist to provide socio-emotional support in addition to  monitoring academic progress.  They also work on goal setting, and are available for counseling for various transitional issues.•  The social worker has also given the staff a presentation on effectively communicating with students and recognizing students  in distress.• Our national honor society has a  peer tutoring program to help students struggling with the increased demand of  high school coursework.  • Our school does not have a monitoring system for tracking professional development activities  currently in place. Teachers are responsible for maintaining their own personal record of PD’s they attend and sharing that  information with administrators as a part of the evaluation process. (Danielson domain 4)• To ensure that all teachers are  receiving 15% of their total PD hours on ELL related topics, the ENL coordinator will conduct mini presentations during weekly  grade level meetings.  She will also create a shared document on the school Google drive that lists upcoming ELL related PD  opportunities outside of school, and any potential webinars that are available.  • The ENL coordinator/teacher already receives  50% of her PD hours on ELL topics as every PD she attends is ELL related.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Maspeth High School offers parents the opportunity to meet with the ENL Coordinator and all teachers and staff members  who are relevant to the student to meet throughout the school year. The ENL coordinator maintains regular contact with the  families of students throughout the school year, and monitors the progress of students weekly. Upon receiving the results of  language assessments, the ENL coordinator makes parental contact and offers parents an in-person meeting.    Maspeth High School utilizes bilingual staff members whenever possible, and otherwise utilizes NYCDOE translation services.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52            2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Maspeth High School encourages parental involvement for all of our students including ELLs.  • The ENL teacher has sent home  translated letters in the parents’ native language at the beginning of the year to inform them of their child’s ENL program, year  goals, and to introduce herself. • Our school has implemented the use of Skedula which allows, teachers, parents, and  students to keep track of student grades, and to find out about homework assignments, and upcoming events.  There is a  translation function in the program so that the information is accessible in a few designated languages for non-English  speaking parents.• Parents are encouraged to attend Parent Teacher Association meetings.  PTA activities for the '17-'18  school year are to be determined• The ENL coordinator shared a document with the staff which indicates all of our parents’  preferred language of communication to ensure that teachers are utilizing various translation options when conducting parent  outreach. She also posted a list of bilingual staff members willing to assist with translation needs.• Our school also uses the  DOE translation and interpretation unit for IEP meetings, parent-teacher conferences, and phone calls home regarding student  behavior and progress.  Teachers were shown how to access the service during grade level meetings.  • We are working  towards providing more translations of documents that are sent home so that all parents have access to important  information.  We will use the DOE translation and interpretation unit to do this.• We would also like to look into establishing a  night or Saturday instructional academy to provide the parents of ELLs the opportunity to learn English for the upcoming  school year.  We can assess the level of interest through a survey.      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Khurshid Abdul Mutakabbir, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and  activities are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Maspeth High School                                                                              School DBN: 24Q585  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
