This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Bronx Health Sciences High School (A College Preparatory School), part of the mini school initiative, was established in  2004 in partnership with Lehman College. “Our mission is to create an environment that fosters critical and creative  learning, respect and tolerance to ensure that all students set and are held to high standards, and achieve academic  excellence." We seek the development of young adults equipped with the necessary literacy and scientific problem  solving skills to become lifelong learners while gaining a sense of personal and community responsibility. We envision  students capable of meeting and exceeding the academic, social, and emotional standards that will allow them to  complete high school and to succeed in college and professional careers. We will achieve our mission by involving   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      teachers, parents, students, and the community as primary stakeholders in promoting a nurturing environment rich in  communication and clear in instructional focus”.          2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Bronx Health Sciences High School is part of the Truman Educational Campus; located in the heart of a diverse and  culturally rich community that encompasses COOP City in the Bronx. However, our students travel from diverse  communities throughout the city. Our school’s primary theme is health and science with an emphasis on college  preparedness. With the goals of preparing students for success in college and professionally, as well as, promoting  exposure to the diversity of health related occupations; all our students are required to wear uniforms, to complete  fourteen health and science electives beyond the core courses, and a minimum of 420 of health related community  service hours. In collaboration with a multitude of hospitals, clinics, nursery homes, and organizations (i.e.:  Montefiore, Beth Abrahams, The American Cancer Society, The Bronx Zoo, etc...); our students have access to  volunteering at numerous health related facilities. For many students the volunteer sites may ultimately become work  related internships. Similarly, the health and science electives (i.e.: Health Science & Research, Animal Behavior,  Anatomy & Physiology, Psychology, etc...) promote career awareness and college endurance & success by providing  students the opportunity to experience the course and content while still in high school.        3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   All student populations are special as all students require individualized planning for optimal success. However, we  look to address the strengths and needs of the SpEDs, the ELLs, and the academically gifted or high performing  students. Largely these students need to be challenged and supported in building stronger literacy foundations and  academic success.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The school's strengths include: 1) a consistent and strongly communicated focus on high academic achievement and  character development for all students, 2) an interdisciplinary approach across all content areas, 3) health theme  infusion across all subject areas, 4) literacy building course for ninth graders 5) timely outreach to parents regarding  attendance, lateness, academics, behavior, and special concerns, 6) after-school collaboration with Morris Heights  Health Center to build student capacity and resilience, and 7) the Big Brother / Big Sister initiative sponsored by the  Student Government. These strengths, among others, have earned the school a high graduation rate as well as a high  college acceptance. In response to the introduction of the Common Core Learning Standards, the new N.Y.S. Common  Core Regents, and the new teacher evaluation guidelines; much work has gone into each area and much progress has  been made in terms of: curricula alignment, research based teaching and learning practices, infusion of literacy across  the content areas, and targeted analysis of student data. Moving forward these same areas persist in being focal  points of reflection and revision for continued growth and development. In addition; further capacity building, around  teacher leadership, teacher teams, and strategic classroom performance tasks and /or activities for diverse learners  are goals for this academic year.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 11X249   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   315   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school.Bronx Health Sciences High School , in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students  Bronx Health Sciences High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  n order to identify ELLs and potential ELLs at Bronx Health Sciences H.S., the HLIS is given to all students new to the system.  This will identify any students eligible for the LAB-R. The HLIS is given to the parents by the Principal and/or Assistant Principal.  The initial oral interview is conducted by the administrators and/or guidance counselor.  The ELA teacher also gives a baseline  assessment for all classified ELLs. The data gathered form this assessment if given to the Literacy teachers as well to help  implement the necessary services that the student needs. The ESL teacher/coordinator administrates and submits the LAB-R  for all eligible students. Anyone who tests in is designated an ELL. Similarly, students who may be ELLs but were never tested  are often identified by fellow teachers who have concerns about students. If a student’s HLIS indicated that they were eligible  to receive services, they are tested. When the NYSESLAT is to be administered, students are scheduled by the Assistant  Principal to be in a secure room. The ESL teacher/coordinator administers each component of the test.

What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   A.      The organizational model of instruction for ELLs is push-in and co-teaching with ELA classes.B.       The program models  are block for the freshmen, and heterogeneously mixed for upperclassmen.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  By looking at students’ scores on Regents, NYSESLAT, and other standardized tests throughout the year, we are able to  evaluate progress of students. We also make adaptations as needed.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Teacher teams review summative data for future subject planning alongside the ESL and ELA teachers.  This will ensure that all  of the needs of the students are met.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]       # 1: RtI for ELLs – An Overview   # 2: RtI Infrastructure – Coordinating a Team and Organizing Stakeholders   # 3: Strong Core Instruction for ELLs – Tier 1   # 4: Serving Struggling ELLs – A Step-by-Step Approach   # 5: Assessment and Evaluation for Special Education – Tiers 2 and 3   The foundation of RtI for ELLs is high-quality core, or Tier 1, instruction focused on promoting language and literacy  development. Only once a rigorous, effective instructional core is in place—one that targets the student population’s needs on  a daily basis as part of a long-term plan—can we begin to build interventions that will serve as truly supplemental and  supportive instruction. Unfortunately, some ELLs are taught in contexts with insufficient opportunities to learn; this kind of  environment is also known as a  ― disabling context ‖  (see Tiers 2, 3). To prevent such inadequate learning opportunities,  strong core instruction must be the norm. This guide provides a reference for instructional strategies that support  differentiated, Tier 1 instruction to promote ELLs’ literacy development.   The guide focuses specifically on:   developing different key domains of literacy, to support competencies in reading, writing, listening, and speaking   presenting instruction that makes direct and appropriate connections to ELLs’ community values, identities, and languages1   In combination, this high-quality core literacy instruction is necessarily culturally and linguistically responsive.   Part I. Key Literacy Domains   Oral Language: The Underpinning of Learning and Knowledge   Why this focus?   Core literacy instruction should build on and expand students’ existing oral language competencies to support literacy learning  and content knowledge. We know from research that English oral language proficiency is closely related to academic  achievement in English. Without well-developed oral language, ELLs cannot readily handle the language and knowledge  demands       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Patterns in NYSESLAT scores reveal reading and writing are the areas students have the most trouble with, while speaking  develops more rapidly.  Patterns in the different modalities will inform instruction by signaling areas that need to be focused on in class. More writing  and reading practice will be emphasized, while encouraging further development of listening and speaking.aste response to  question here:      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54            7.

Organization of staff     In our program model of ESL, the content area teachers and ESL teacher work closely together in a collaborative  manner to deliver instruction. The students receive the mandated amount of instructional minutes, or more,  according to this system. All students receive these services through co-teaching with an ELA teacher, push-in, and  pull-out services (as needed).             All content areas are delivered in English with scaffolded instruction with individual adaptations as needed, as  well as small group and 1:1 assistance from the ESL teacher. Students also engage in collaborative school wide  projects and presentations to enrich academic and communicative acquisition of English.       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A     c.

How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              The performance of the ELLs in Bronx Health Sciences High School reflects the need for providing services focusing on  increasing literacy in English, as well as encouraging continued development of the students' L1s (L1 being native  language).  The ESL teacher has resource books in a small library focusing on the various content areas, improving English  vocabulary, developing reading comprehension, developing academic language, and building bridges between the student's L1  and L2 (in 68% of the ELLs, L1 being Spanish; L2 being English).  The books are available during the school day, after school  during tutoring, and to use as sources school research projects.

Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.              At BHS, we are committed to addressing the needs of all of our ELLs.  We include English Language Learners in all aspects  of school life, in order to help them meet their academic needs (based on state ELA and math assessments).  At BHS, we place  a strong emphasis on a balanced educational approach that includes cooperative learning and inquiry based instruction.  This  emphasis, when paired with ESL methodologies across the content areas, helps to ensure that the needs of our ELLs are  adequately met.  The model of lesson plan instruction used at BHS involves the inclusion of interactive mini-lessons, partner  and small group work, independent work, and whole class sharing.  This model is a particularly effective way of teaching ELLs  at BHS.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?       he ESL teacher will facilitate in the academic development of ELLs by encouraging teachers to employ multi-level grouping in  their content-area classes, to incorporate ESL methodologies into their teaching, and to further developing lesson plans for  implementation in classes which employ team-teaching.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status            SIFE students are identified through ATS and given special 1:1 attention, as well as tutoring to assist them in developing  their BICS and CALP, as well as encouraged to work in native language study groups. Instruction is scaffolded through more  clear instructions and modeling.     B. Newcomers are given small group, 1:1, as well as whole group instruction to assure they receive the mandated hours of  service, as well as develop as quickly as possible in their acquisition of English. ELA Regents prep classes are available to help  students pass the ELA Regents.     C. Students who have been in ESL for 4-6 years are given small group as well as whole group instruction to assure they  receive the mandated hours of service, as well as develop as quickly as possible in transitioning from Intermediate and  Advanced levels of English acquisition to proficient. ELA Regents prep classes are also available to help these students pass the  ELA Regents.     D. Long-term ELLs are looked at on an individual basis through case conferencing with the ESL teacher and administration to  try to help these students develop. Individual NYSESLAT scores are looked at to identify levels of weakness, and plans  developed to help those areas become more developed.     E. ELLs with special needs are also looked at on an individual basis through case conferencing with the ESL teacher, special  education teacher, and administration to try to help these students develop. Individual NYSESLAT scores are looked at to  identify levels of weakness, and plans developed to help those areas become more developed. These students also receive 1:1  instruction and assistance indicated in their IEPs.             In terms of targeting ELLs in the content areas of math, social studies, and other areas, there are services offered ranging  from 1:1 tutoring, small group lunchtime tutoring, P.M. school, as well as push-in services from a licensed ESL teacher. These  services are offered in English, with L1 scaffolds as needed.     For newly proficient ELLs, they remain in mainstream classes but are closely monitored and offered tutoring and extra help  as needed. Open communication about students’ individual needs between faculty and staff makes this possible.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56              For the upcoming school year, new programs being implemented are clubs for students to become part of, such as a chess  club and writing club. There are also smaller classes to target students who need extra help.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?           The ESL teacher will facilitate in the academic development of ELLs by encouraging teachers to employ multi-level  grouping in their content-area classes, to incorporate ESL methodologies into their teaching, and to further developing lesson  plans for implementation in classes which employ team-teaching.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?         We include English Language Learners in all aspects of school life, in order to help them meet their academic needs (based  on state ELA and math assessments).  At BHS, we place a strong emphasis on a balanced educational approach that includes  cooperative learning and inquiry based instruction.  This emphasis, when paired with ESL methodologies across the content  areas, helps to ensure that the needs of our ELLs are adequately met.  The model of lesson plan instruction used at BHS  involves the inclusion of interactive mini-lessons, partner and small group work, independent work, and whole class  sharing.  This model is a particularly effective way of teaching ELLs at BHS.          To help our ELLs attain the high standards we have set together, to succeed in their classes, and to master city-wide and  state assessments, we offer after school tutoring, as well as preparation for Regents examinations in Regents classes.          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Miriam Rivas, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Bronx Health Sciences 11X249                                                                              School DBN: 11X249  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      There are many means of             Patterns in NYSESLAT scores reveal reading and writing are the areas students have the most trouble with, while  speaking develops more rapidly.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      Patterns in the different modalities will inform instruction by signaling areas that need to be focused on in class.  More writing and reading practice will be emphasized, while encouraging further development of listening and  speaking.   ESL Program Patterns    A. All students are intermediate or advanced by their sophomore year. The high intermediate and advanced  students are faring well in terms of passing Regents. 75% of ELLs taking the Regents in ELA last year passed, and  81% passed the Living Environment Regents. Students taking tests in their home language fare almost equally as  well in comparison to those taking the test in English.   B. ELL periodic assessment data are sued to help inform instruction, as well as to determine what student needs  still must be met.   C. Native language is used to explain concepts not fully understood in English. Periodic Assessments also reveal  that our ELLs are developing quite well, matching up to the progress of our mainstream students.   By looking at students’ scores on Regents, NYSESLAT, and other standardized tests throughout the year, we are  able to evaluate progress of students. We also make adaptations as needed.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    The following information  was given to both the  students and parents in  both english and their  native language.    The organizational model of  instruction for ELLs is push- in and co-teaching with ELA  classes.    The program models are  block for the freshmen, and  heterogeneously mixed for  upperclassmen.    . Organization of staff    . In our program model of  ESL, the content area  teachers and ESL teacher  work closely together in a  collaborative manner to  deliver instruction. The  students receive the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64     mandated amount of  instructional minutes, or  more, according to this  system. All students receive  these services through co- teaching with an ELA  teacher, push-in, and pull- out services (as needed).    All content areas are  delivered in English with  scaffolded instruction with  individual adaptations as  needed, as well as small  group and 1:1 assistance  from the ESL teacher.  Students also engage in  collaborative school wide  projects and presentations  to enrich academic and  communicative acquisition  of English. This information  will be provided to the  parents and students via  translated documents.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.            Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      Document Name    Month/Frequency   How do you   Distributed to   plan to   Families    translate?   Include   procedures  to ensure   timely   provision of  translated  documents  to parents.       NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS      A. Schools and offices are responsible for providing each parent  whose primary language is a   covered language and who require language assistance services with  a copy of the   Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities which includes their rights  regarding   translation and interpretation services.   B. Schools and offices must post in a conspicuous location at or near  the primary entrance to   such school a sign in each of the covered languages, or most  prominent   covered languages, indicating the availability of interpretation  services.   Each school’s safety plan will contain procedures for ensuring that  parents in need of   language access services are not prevented from reaching the  school’s administrative   offices solely due to language barriers.   Each school at which the parents of more than 10% of the children at  such school speak a   primary language that is neither English nor a covered language, shall  obtain from the   Translation and Interpretation Unit a translation into such language  of the signage and   forms required pursuant to this section and shall post and provide  such forms in accordance   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      with this section.            2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as   parent-teacher   conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.        Meeting Name    Month/Frequency   of Meetings    How does  your school   plan to  provide   interpretation   service(s)?          Bronx Health Sciences HS will individually meet with the parents or  guardians of English language learners at least once a year, in  addition to parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations,  quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled meetings provided  for parents or guardians, to discuss the goals of the program, their  child’s language development progress, their child’s English language  proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in  all content areas. This additional meeting should include school staff  necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the  child’s language development in all content areas in English and in  the child’s home language in the case of students enrolled in a  bilingual education program. Such meeting is conducted with a  qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of  communication the parent or guardian best understands. Bronx  Health Sciences determine the manner and form of such individual  parent meetings, in accordance with collective bargaining  agreements. Our school will record attendance using existing  procedures.            3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.               Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.

Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The Department shall provide interpretation services, to the maximum extent practicable    within the budget appropriated for such services, during regular business hours, to parents    whose primary language is a covered language and who request such services in order to    communicate with school staff and school officials regarding critical information about their    child’s education.    Depending upon availability, such interpretation services may be provided either at the    location where the parent is seeking to communicate or by telephone.    The Department’s Translation and Interpretation Unit shall provide interpretation services at    the following Citywide meetings:    1. Panel for Educational Policy Meetings;    2. Citywide ELL parent meetings;    3. Citywide/Community Education Council Meetings;    4. Other Citywide parent meetings organized by central offices.    Interpretation services shall be provided in whichever of the covered languages the    Department expects will be spoken as the primary language(s) of the persons attending    such meeting or event.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       The administrative and office staff work together to ensure the information is sent out based on the list of entitled  students. They check off forms as received. If none are received, letters are sent out or parents are called in for a face  to face conference.    Guidance and the ESL teacher monitor the influx of forms and follow up with those that have not been completed and  returned by contacting parents.    Guidance and the ESL teacher ensure that the placement parent notification letters are distributed.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69
