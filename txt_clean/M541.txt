This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   We are a small school community dedicated to guiding every student through our rigorous academic programs, while  preparing every student for a successful transition to college.

Our dedicated faculty assists our students in overcoming challenges through a strong school community that supports  their emotional as well as academic needs. We aspire to set high reaching goals that stretch our talents and expand  our horizons.   As an early college high school we not only prepare our students for postsecondary success but do so in three years.  In their fourth year, our seniors travel to Hunter College where they enroll in both high school and college courses.  Students develop the college readiness skills to succeed on a college campus, including time management,  collaboration, self-advocacy, and effective study skills.   At MHSHS we not only graduate nearly 100% of our students on time but do so with close to a full semester of college  credits. This results in over 90% of graduates accepted to four year colleges and universities.   Our greatest challenge is to ensure that all students, regardless of circumstance, graduate college and career ready.  Aligned with the chancellor's vision (as well as our superintendent's) for equity and excellence, when we say “all” at  MHSHS, we mean it.    To accomplish this every faculty member is guided by our shared values:   I. We never give up on a student.   II. We prepare all students for college readiness and success.   III. We appreciate, respect and embrace our school’s cultural diversity.    IV. We support and encourage rich and meaningful after-school experiences.   V.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36     State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Manhattan Hunter Science HS , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Manhattan Hunter Science HS will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?   Presently we are using STAR reading for English classes.  The data shows that our ELL students are more greatly challenged  when communicating in written form.  The data shows that our ELLs seem to be equally adept at speaking, listening, reading  and writing.   In consultation with the ELL teacher, content area teachers are guided as to how to help students meet academic  expectations and meet state standards.  The ELL teacher also provides information on additional support that will benefit  students based on the areas of strength and deficiency.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The ELL teacher co-plans with the general education teacher.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         We look at their success rates in other classes, Regents results and NYSESLAT  results.  The expectation is that each ELL will  increase in at least one proficiency level during the school year.  If this goal is not met, we look at the raw score data and plan  accordingly for that individual student by looking at the areas in which they were most challenged.  At this point, all of our ELLs  from prior years  have tested out as proficient.  We also look at college readiness and all of our ELLs from the prior year had at  least an 80 in a math Regents and a 75 in the English Regents.  We have reached 100% of our goals for the ELLs.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We have targeted Regents prep, mandated homework center and meetings with student, general education and ELL teacher.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    This is not applicable to our school as we are a high school and do not have grades K-5.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data patterns for NYSESLAT scores show that our students are consistently moving on to a higher proficiency level and all  from previous years tested out as proficient/commanding.  Historically, we see the same on the LAB-R/NYSITELL as students  who initially tested as requiring ENL have moved out of ENL across all grades.  The NYSESLAT results show where student  strengths are and this data is used to differentiate and program students so their individual needs are met.  We have two  current tenth graders who seem weaker in writing.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ELL teacher will meet with general education teachers of the specified student.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   All current ENL instruction is delivered using the push in method.  The student spends the majority of the day in an all  English content area class.  There are supports in place for these students in their native language such as glossaries  and translators.  The ENL students would be grouped heterogeneously.       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Not applicable    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not applicable        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?               The number of ENL periods per day a student is programmed for is dictated by the results of the NYSESLAT exam from the  previous Spring.  If a student is newly enrolled in NYC DOE and did not take the NYSESLAT exam the year before, they are  programmed in a level based on the results of the NYSITELL exam.  All students who score in the beginner proficiency level   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      receive three periods of pull-out ENL instruction per day.  Three periods per day is equivalent to 132 minutes per day, five days  a week, which totals 660 minutes per week.  Students who score in the emerging proficiency level are programmed for two  periods of pull-out ENL instruction per day which equals 88 minutes per day, five days a week for a weekly total of 440  minutes.  Students who score in the transitioning or   advanced proficiency level are programmed for one period of push-in  ENL instruction per day and one period of English with their native English speaking peers.  They receive 44 minutes of ENL  instruction per day totaling 220 minutes per week. We don't offer NLA but we do offer translated copies of material.           3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      The ENL teacher is a member of one of four grade teams in our school and serves as a member of the English department.  At  these weekly meetings, the teachers collaborate to ensure consistency and share best practices.  The co-planning time is  crucial to ensure that the ELL students are receiving the same level of instruction as their native English speaking peers with  additional supports in their native language.  Language Arts is taught using ENL and ELA instructional strategies.  Specific area  content and skill sets needed from other subject areas are supported by activities done within the integrated class and by  helping ELL students to focus on trouble spots during extended day.  These areas are identified by the classroom teacher and  relayed to the ENL teacher during teacher team meetings.  Additionally, the ELL students are taught test-taking skills, reading  for meaning and reading strategies, test question vocabulary, listening for details,  pacing, argumentive writing and  counterpoint writing among other things which align with Common Core learning Standards.  In these programs the students  use dictionaries and translators.  The teachers also have information translated in the student's native language.  We have also  ordered native language content books so we can start our own native language library.  Based on the discussions at the grade  level teams, the teachers collaborate and share units they will be starting.   It is for this purpose that the team meeting time is  so valuable.  We do not offer TBE or Dual Language.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?       Students can respond on tests in their native language and we have staff that can translate.  Students who take the  NYSITELL  and their native language is Spanish are given the Spanish LAB-R if it is deemed they are eligible to receive ENL  services.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     Currently we don't have a SIFE student, but if we did they would be fully integrated into the supportive school  environment.   Our newcomers  do work in content area classes with supportive instructions provided by the ELL teacher.  We  are particularly sensitive to ELL testing and marry both strong instruction in general education classes with focus on reading,  writing, listening and special instruction using strategies most likely to be successful with ELL students.  Our ELL teacher makes  use of QTEL training that is specially geared towards assisting ELL students in mastering skills requisite to the ELA Regents and  Global  Regents examinations.  For our developing ELLs the focus would be on reading strategies, such as, text marking,  summarizing, skimming and scanning, making text to text and text to self connections.  In addition, there would be more  emphasis on vocabulary development.  For long term ELLs, various interventions would be used in the areas of reading and  writing.  In reading they would work on summarizing techniques, reading comprehensions strategies and vocabulary  development.  In writing theywould focus on paragraphing, use of transition words and staying on topic.  They also would  work on tasks to ensure that they are successful in their Regents exams.  Students who are former ELLs would continue to be  eligible for special  testing accommodations for two years after achieving proficiency as well as receiving push in ENL support.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49       The ELL students are encouraged to use their digital translators in their content areas classes.  This ensures that the students  can still comprehend the information even if there is a language barrier.  The students can also reference the glossaries in their  home language that are stored in their content area classrooms.  There is a focus on academic vocabulary and writing  development. Additionally, the grade teams meet weekly to ensure consistency throughout all classrooms whether it is an ENL  class or a core content class.  The teachers also work together in teacher teams to ensure an interdisciplinary approach is being  used so the concepts and skills taught are constantly being reinforced.  Furthermore, all teacher lesson plans include various  differentiation tactics to allow the individual student to identify their own entry point into the lesson.  The school ensures the  ELL-SWDs who have IEPs that mandate ENL instruction are serviced by having grade team meetings where both the Special  Education teacher and ENL teacher are present.  During these meetings the IEPs are reviewed and updated when necessary.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   The student is mainstreamed and receives extra services through Resource Room/SETSS.  If we had ICT students requiring ELL  services they would be placed in an ENL class as well.  Our ELL techer attends IEP meetings and discusses language goals at  these meetings.                 8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   Manhattan Hunter Science HS works to infuse its interdisciplinary curriculum with experience in and reflective study of science  and research techniques supported by Hunter College.  We encourage civic dialogue and empower members of our diverse  school community to work towards a more just, humane and vibrant world.  Each student is provided with an individualized  learning environment that is engaging and inquiry-based.  Students learn to question at increasing levels of sophistication,  gather information from a variety of sources, look at diverse ways to problem solve and form conclusions, imagine new  possibilities for themselves (and the world), and take constructive action when appropriate.  ELLs participate fully in all aspects  of this endeavor.  The ENL teacher creates a thesaurus of topical words for each subject area.  The students can refer to these  synonyms and visual aids in each class.  We plan to order native language content area textbooks for our ELL students.  The  books will be stored in the ELL library and students will be able to use them as needed.  We are going to order books that can  be used in Science classes, Math classes, English classes and Social Studies classes.  Students are often paired with a peer who  speaks the same language so this student can help translate material if necessary.  All ELLs are encouraged to attend extended  day (an additional period on Tuesdays, Wednesdays & Thursdays from 2:20-3:00) for math, science and social studies extra  help.  The ENL teacher provides content support in ESL class and works with content teachers during extended day.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We have been working on creating a bilingual library with supplementary materials in student's native language.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?     There are no programs/services for ELLs that will be discontinued this year.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.    The school places a strong belief in the importance of contributing to the community.  Manhattan Hunter Science HS requires  all students to complete community service hours as a requirement for graduation.  Students are offered a variety of  opportunities throughout the year or they may find their own service requirements.  Students can participate in a variety of  educational, sports and social activities such as campuswide soccer, basketball, badminton, volleyball, wrestling, and track and  field teams where they can compete against students from other high schools as long as they maintain academic  eligibility.  Our individual school also has the school newspaper, the arts club, the drama society, the volunteer club and the  chorus, to name a few.  These meet during school and after school providing a variety of opportunities for students based on  their interests.  They also get to go on trips with most of the clubs, either during school or outside of school.  The sports  programs are funded by the PSAL and other programs from general school funds.  These programs are offered after school and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      on Saturdays.   All students who are in good academic standing are eligible and encouraged to participate.  Students can also  join student government, and when academically eligible, apply for membership in the National Honor Society, the National  Science Honor Society and the National Spanish Honor Society.  All of these opportunities and experiences are available to  ELLs.  All of the extracurricular programs, in addition to helping students improve their skill sets in these athletic areas, foster  conversations which is beneficial for our ELL students.  The more exposure they have to the English language, the faster they  will increase their fluency.  We had former ELL students who were class presidents and featured speakers selected by their  classmates to speak at graduation.  All students at Manhattan Hunter Science HS have the opportunity to take advantage of  support services offered.  These include, but are not limited to, counseling, guidance, tutoring, peer review and  assessment.  LEP students participate in these services the same as any other student enrolled at Manhattan Hunter Science  HS.  We also offer SAT prep, ACT prep and computer lab use to all juniors and seniors.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   The students have access to computer programs to supplement their learning.  Students can use these computer programs  after school hours and during lunch.  We have Rosetta Stone available and are currently looking into other computer programs  .  We also have an LCD cart or SMARTBoard and computer in every room to ensure visual aids are used in all content area  classes to support our ENL students.  The technology that is available allows the students to conduct research to answer  questions they may have about content material in their native language.  Frequent class trips to the computer lab also helps  our ELLs.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is provided to our students through the use of peer translators in the classes as well as access to  digital translators and word for word glossaries.  Additionally, students can refer to textbooks in the native language.  The  native language is used to assist vocabulary development.  We have paperback word for word dictionaries and bilingual  glossaries as well.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.     Required services support, and resources correspond to ELLs ages and grade levels.  The native language textbooks are written  for the content areas offered in various grades.  The language used is grade appropriate and the visuals in the text help  support the academic instruction.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     The students have access to computer programs to supplement their learning.  Students can use these computer programs  after school hours and during lunch.  We have Rosetta Stone available and are currently looking into other computer programs  .  We also have an LCD cart or SMARTBoard and computer in every room to ensure visual aids are used in all content area  classes to support our ENL students.  The technology that is available allows the students to conduct research to answer  questions they may have about content material in their native language.  Frequent class trips to the computer lab also helps  our ELLs.  All ELLs are entitled to the same shared resources as all our students on campus.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELLs and their parents/guardians are given an orientation by the ENL teacher which includes an introduction to  staff and at least one student who speaks their home language, if possible.  They are given a tour of the school and key areas  of the shared campus such as the morning scanning area, cafeteria, gym and auditorium.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish is the language elective offered to Manhattan Hunter Science High School students.  ELLs are able to take foreign  language classes at Hunter College through the College Now program or as part of the course of study during their senior  year.  Also, when our ELLs pass out of ENL in their sophomore or junior years, they take Spanish.                      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51            18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We do not have a dual language program at this time.       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our ELL teacher attends most professional development sessions offered by the New York City Department of Education as  well as CUNY which is our support network.  He has attended network ELL professional development workshops as well as  common core learning standards professional development.  He also attending training for the NYSITELL.  We also take  advantage of professional development opportunities offered by outside agencies.  Some of the professional development  sessions that our ELL teacher attended in past years have focuses on topics such as, task rotation, building academic  vocabulary , scaffolding, assessment and co-teaching.    At monthly faculty meetings and/or grade team meetings, our ELL teacher has the opportunity to turn key the information to  all the Manhattan Hunter Science HS faculty which includes administrators and support staff.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    Our content area teachers have ELL students in their classes.  During staff development sessions, we often focus on best  practices with ENL students so they can be implemented into content area classes.  We also have advisory classes where staff  are trained to work with students to develop study skills and habits that will help them succeed in high school and college  readiness skills for the future.  Staff are notified as to which students are ELLs, how many years of service as ELLs and what  their NYSESLAT levels are.            During each Chancellor's Professional Development Day, time is set aside to develop the entire staff's ELL knowledge with a  focus on how to provide content area support to ELL students.  In addition, during several monthly faculty conferences  throughout the year time is allocated to staff ELL concerns as well as on approaches that will benefit our ENL population.  The  sum total of time for these sessions exceeds 15% of the total hours for all teachers for the entire school year.  Our ENL teacher  is a shared teacher and he attends outside workshops as well as professional developments sessions for both  schools.  Agendas and materials from professional development activities are kept on file.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52            Our ENL teacher coordinates a meeting with the parent and include content area teachers.  Translators would be obtained  through DOE translation services if needed.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.      2. Attendance records would be kept by the ESL teacher.  Meetings would be conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator  in the language the parent understands.  Parents would be contacted by phone and mail using translation services.     3. All parents of students who are enrolled at Manhattan Hunter Science HS are invited to attend monthly Parent Association  meetings.  These meetings are facilitated by the Parent Coordinator and all parents/guardians are invited and encouraged to  attend.  Notification of the meetings is sent out via phone messenger in the home language of the family as well as via monthly  mailings.  In addition to discussing issues related specifically to our school such as, dress code, uniform policy, grading policy,  etc, the parents brainstorm additional parent meeting topics.  All parents/guardians are invited to attend workshops where  they can learn about graduation requirements and Jupiter, the online gradebook we use.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kevin Froner, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Manhattan Hunter Science HS                                                                              School DBN: 03M541  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
