This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our vision is to create a highly collaborative environment, among staff, parents, and children, in which we prepare  students for college and career readiness by attending to the whole child. We employ research-based best practices  while piloting new academic programs and interventions to provide students with various avenues to success in  school and in life. Our high expectations for student performance, in tandem with the New York State Common Core  State Standards, are routinely communicated to all relevant parties as part of our daily practicum.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.

PS22Q is a Title I, elementary (Pre-K to 5) school, located in Flushing, Queens. We serve a population of over 800  children, most of whom are immigrants, including first-generation. Our students represent the multi-ethnic,  multicultural neighborhood of Flushing, where many new immigrants arrive daily. There are over 25 nationalities  represented among our students. Approximately 60% of our children are English Language Learners and over 80% of  them come from homes in which languages other than English are spoken. Chinese (mostly Mandarin, but also  Cantonese and other Chinese dialects) and Spanish are the predominant languages spoken by our students. However,  we also have students who speak Korean, Pashtu, Urdu, Bengali, Punjabi, Russian, Albanian, and Nepali.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   our Hispanic ELL students are our targeted subgroup.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   PS 22Q has achieved numerous prestigious accomplishments including being designated a New York State Reward  School, receiving a majority of 'Well Developed' ratings on the school Quality Review, and receiving a majority of  'Excellence' ratings on the New York City Framework for Great Schools Report.    Despite our pattern of excellence, we recognize the ever-changing nature of students, families, and pedagogy.  Therefore, we have considered avenues of continued improvement and we have chosen the following areas of focus  for the 2018-19 school year: 1) Building strong roots in mathematics by participating in the Algebra For All program  and aligning professional development to teacher's instructional needs and student's academic needs as measured by  a 5% increase on their performance on the 2019 State math test, ADVANCE, and end of unit tests. 2) fostering a  supportive environment across the schools and a clear vision for Social Emotional Learning through the continued  use of RULER, participation in the Muttigree program, parent teacher home visits, and a staff “adopt a student”  program ultimately providing a large variety of nurturing experiences resulting in a 5% increase in students feeling  connected to adults in the building as measured by teacher created surveys based on scholar centric. 3) building  collaboration and alignment in teacher pedagogy and content knowledge across the curriculum through targeted  professional development and planning opportunities focused on designing instruction that requires clear  expectations, higher level thinking, student centered and rigorous tasks in order to increase student engagement  resulting in 3% increase of teachers receiving an overall rating of “highly effective” in Danielson component 3c. 4)  working closely in teacher team inquiry groups to increase teacher content knowledge, closely analyze student work  products and improve instructional practices in Mathematics and ELA utilizing a variety of data sources resulting in a  3% decrease in the achievement gap of targeted sub-groups on the New York State ELA and Mathematics Assessment.  5) Strengthening our positive and collaborative relationship with families by creating a variety of both academic and  enriching workshops and opportunities for parents to participate in with their children resulting in a 3% increase in  parents responding positively about school events as measured by the 2019 New York City School Survey Report  and/or a 3% increase in students reading at or above grade level in fifth grade as measured by TC Running Record  levels.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         All of the above goals have been determined after careful consideration of our school data and a commitment to  effectively creating a learning environment of professionalism and academic rigor within the context of camaraderie,  mutual respect, and shared trust.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 25Q022   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   921   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Since our school has implemented RULER in 2017-2018, we have found that students are able to recognize their  emotions, understand the causes and consequences, label the emotions to describe feelings precisely, express  emotions to communicate in effectively, and regulate those emotions. Administrators, teachers, staff and parents  are now assisting our students with challenging emotional experiences with effective strategies to regulate a  positive school climate and culture. This indicates that the protocols that we have established are effective. We use  protocols such as Crisis Intervention Team, SBST Team, Student of the Month, Life Skills Center, Respect for All  curriculum, Peer Mediation, “Cozy Corner” in the cafeteria and in the classrooms, Student Government, Family  Nights, Kindergarten Lunch Monitors, After-school enrichment programs such as Beautiful Me and Family Fun Days,  Classroom incentive Charts, Classroom Economy token program, and daily/ weekly reflections using the Charter.    Although these teams, programs, and classroom management protocols are effective more specific guidelines for  handling uncomfortable feelings and methods for creating and sustaining a positive climate need to be  implemented. To collect data, the Emotional Intelligence Team analyzed the questions on the scholar centric survey  and created a child friendly survey specific to each grade. The results of the Emotional Intelligence survey  administered at the end of 2018 across Pre- K to 5, show that our students did not feel that they have at least one  person in school that they can trust and talk to.    Throughout the 2018-2019 school year, we will implement new programs such as Parent Home Visits, the  Muttigree program and a staff “adopt a student” program to provide a large variety of nurturing experiences and  ensure that we are supporting the whole child. The implementation of the the Parent Home Visits will foster the  connection between the student, parents, and teachers. Additionally each staff will “adopt a student” where the  child will feel supported in school and have someone who they feel comfortable with. Along with that we will be  implementing the Muttigree program curriculum into the classroom by using Lady Jefferson to help students  become calmer, social, and focused students.

Historically, our progress reports have indicated a weakness in the area “closing the achievement gaps for subgroups,  including English language learners (ELL’s) and Students with Disabilities (SWDs).” However, according to the 2013- 2014 school quality guide we were rated as “meeting target” for closing the achievement gap. In addition, according  to the 2016-2017 school quality snapshot we received an “excellent rating” in regards to closing the achievement gap  and showing an improvement of ELL’s test scores on the ELA. While this data is encouraging and indicates that we are  moving in right direction, our demographics are showing an increase in our ENL population prompting the need to  accommodate ENL learners even more, especially our Hispanic ENL learners.      According to the 2016-17 School Quality Snapshot:     Based on the results on the school quality guide from the 2016-2017 school year; our demographics show   that our school is 53% English Language Learners. This number has increased by 8% from the 2016-2017  school year prompting the need to accommodate learners even more.   According to an analysis of NYSESLAT 2018:     An analysis of PS 22 NYSESLAT for 318 ELLs in grades 1-5. Approximately 60 ELLs scored commanding.   Approximately 23 ELLs scored expanding and 3 or 4 on the ELA.      3% of ELLs are in their fifth or sixth year of service    There was an increase in Speaking across the grades from last year’s NYSESLAT.    Writing has been noted as the area of need throughout the grades.   According to an analysis of 2018 ELA and Math:   ELA         In 3rd grade, 72% of ELLS scored a level 1 or 2 on the ELA. There was a 2 % decrease in proficiency level 3 or 4  from 2017. 68% of the 3rd grade students with an IEP scored a level 1 or 2 on the ELA. An analysis of our  Hispanic subgroup, shows ELA growth from the 2016-2017 school year. In 2017, 33% of Hispanic students  tested scored a level 3 and 48% of Hispanics tested scored a level 3 or 4 on the 2018 ELA.  In 4th grade, ELLs, students with IEP’s and the Hispanic subgroup showed progress on the 2018 ELA. 76% of  the ELLs tested scored a level 3 or 4. 66% of 4th graders with IEPs scored a level 3 or 4. 69% of the Hispanic  subgroup tested 3 or 4 in 2018.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          28         In 5th grade, 90% of the ELLs scored a level 1 or 2 on the ELA. 80% of the students with IEP’s tested scored  level 1 or 2 on the 2018 ELA. 58% of Hispanic students tested scored a level 1 or 2 on the ELA. This grade has  been targeted as the weakest.

However, only 11% of teachers scored a highly  effective in student engagement in two or more observations and 19% of teachers scored at least one highly effective.  Student engagement is an integral part of effective learning and teaching. In fact, when talking about the importance  of student engagement the Danielson rubric states, “student engagement in learning is the centerpiece of the  Framework for Teaching; all other components contribute to it.” With that said, it brings to light that all of the other  components must be strong in order to be highly effective in student engagement as well. Therefore, in order to  support teachers and build their capacity in student engagement we need to strengthen their pedagogy and  knowledge across the curriculum.    To achieve this, teachers will participate in cycles of learning with the in-house staff developer and TC staff  developers. The cycles will last for 4-6 weeks and consist of an overview meeting, lab sites, inter-visitations, in class  coaching support, data review, think tanks, and debrief sessions. Teachers will be asked to complete exit tickets about  their experience and their plan for continued implementation of their new learning. Follow-up coaching visits in the  classroom will help support teachers with their new learning and prevent the “implementation dip” that often occurs.  In addition to curriculum and instructional support, all learning cycles will include ways to engage students such as  inquiry, questioning, rigorous and meaningful tasks, supportive partnerships, student choice, reflective practices, and  self-assessment. Teachers will be asked to think about designing instruction and tasks that require them to not only  be interested, enthusiastic, and motivated but also to ensure “they are challenged to be minds-on” and aware of the  tasks’ expectations. Danielson defines an engaged classroom as a classroom where, “students are developing their  understanding through what they do.” This is the lens all teachers should have as they design their tasks and lessons.      Cohorts will be created based on areas of need and various data sources. For example, we developed targeted  professional learning for word study based on the June 2018 MoSL and 2018 ELA results. In June 2018, while all  students showed progress on our MoSL, the results also indicated that 16% of K, 32% of 1st, 17% of 2nd, 28% of 3, 13%  of 4th, and 23% of 5th scored below benchmark. In addition, our ELA results indicated that vocabulary acquisition,  determining word meaning, and vocabulary usage were among our lowest five performing standards across grades 3,  4, and 5. These results prompted an audit of the curriculum to ensure that in addition to our reading workshop, word  study and authentic vocabulary instruction was being done with fidelity and in an engaging manner. Based on this  data, first grade continues to participate in targeted professional learning in Fundations and grade 3 is now  implementing Words Their Way into their instruction due to their high number of below benchmark readers.. School  wide, teachers are looking at their vocabulary and word study instruction and ensuring that it is aligned to their  students’ needs. Future professional development is planned around aligning their work with the TC reading   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      progressions, diving deeper into understanding what the lowest performing standards mean, and looking at units of  study to identify teachable moments for contextual vocabulary and word study instruction.      Our TC staff developers will also work in small grade cohorts and conduct targeted professional learning sessions  consisting of lab sites inter-visitations, and coaching sessions. The in-house staff developer and the district assigned  Universal Literacy Coach will support the teachers in this work by conducting walk-throughs and coaching visits in  between TC sessions.      To support planning needs, all teachers will be given extra planning preps throughout the year. This time is allotted  for planning and preparation as outlined in components 1a Demonstrating knowledge of content and pedagogy and  1e Designing coherent instruction. ENL teachers and classroom teachers will continue to have congruence time so  that they can align their teaching and plan effectively for the students. Teachers will also participate in multiple  opportunities for job embedded professional learning through inquiry teams and inter-visitations. These inter- visitations have been increased from 2 to 4 this year. Teachers will be matched for inter-visitations based on ratings in  ADVANCE, needs, and teacher interest. All highly effective practices will be highlighted, especially teachers that have  demonstrated strong abilities to engage students. As a follow-up, teachers will be asked complete exit tickets about  their experience and their plan for implementation of their new learning.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Recruitment: All teaching candidates must submit a resume outlining their education and experience to inform  administration of abilities/talent/experience. When possible, tentative candidates plan and deliver a lesson, observed  by administration. If the candidate has worked in other schools (student teacher, substitute, excessed), the principal  personally calls the school to inquire about previous assignments and quality of teaching.      Retention: Teachers are invited to participate in the decision making of school related protocols, curriculum, etc.  Teachers receive verbal and written commendations and thank you’s for their work and participation in school  functions. Administration allocates time to collaborate on quality planning and analyzing student growth. There is on- going professional development to ensure all teachers are highly qualified. Administration strives to ensure small class  sizes to support high quality teaching.      Assignments: All staff assignments align to their licensed area of expertise and identified areas of strengths, interests,  and preference.      Support of High quality PD: We currently have upper and lower grade TC staff developers and a in-house staff  developer to conduct high quality professional development. Teachers participate in lab sites on site to observe new  teaching practices and deepen others. Teachers and administrators attend Calendar Days at Teacher's College. We  hold grade and Monday afternoon Meetings for informing teachers in CCSS instructional shifts, Universal Design for  Learning, and Webb’s Depth of Knowledge, The Capacity Framework, aligning curriculum to CCSS, Go Math planning,  Unit Planning, and planned vertical and horizontal Curriculum. On Mondays, teachers attend specialty inquiry team  meetings to research, discuss and reflect various areas of instruction. Teachers attend off site district specialty team  meetings on topics such as oral language, text complexity, and academic language. In addition, teachers attend the  Queens North Borough Field Support Center support for workshops on topics such as special education CCLS, ESL,  Math, RTI, data analysis, Teacher Effectiveness, Quality Review.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  Our preschool program follows the CCSS for Pre-K, which is the foundation for the Kindergarten standards. Teachers  incorporate parts of TC reading and writing strategies into their lessons, such as read alouds, turn and talk, shared  reading, and shared writing. Reading and writing focuses on various genres. Many students are brought into the  school to participate in various cluster programs.      In June, Kindergarten teachers receive articulation cards and portfolios ( math and writing samples). Kindergarten  teachers are provided with information about the child’s academic, social, and emotional strengths and weaknesses.  In addition, a workshop is led by the Pre-K teachers supplying the parents with information on what to expect in  kindergarten and activities that can be done with their child over the summer to help make the transition easier. Staff  members, such as parent coordinator and PRE-K social worker, provide the Pre-K parents and teachers with assistance  and support as needed.       An instructional coach visits regularly to provide feedback to Pre-K teacher and to ensure smooth kindergarten  transition.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Administration meets regularly with teachers by providing time for grade meeting and Monday PD to discuss choices  of assessments and how the data they receive will drive instruction. Vertical Teacher teams have been developed to  discuss assessment and noticings. Time for each team member to turn-key information to their grade is scheduled.  Administration is open to all teachers’ feedback about what works and what needs to be improved on. Teachers  reflect about the rating they receive on 3c: Engaging Students in Learning and 3d: Using Assessment in Instruction,  after each informal or formal observation. Teachers take into consideration these ratings when they are given options  for or when requesting professional development.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Column A   Verify with an (X)   Column B   Section Reference(s)  X     X     X        X        1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students.

The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 22 Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 22 Q will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● . providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and  decision making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support    and monitor their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format,    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      and in languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to    improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between    parents and other members of the school community.      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent    Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

It serves a student population of over 900 (Pre-K-5)  children that is largely first-generation immigrant. As stated in the CEP, students come from the  multi-ethnic, multi-cultural neighborhood of Flushing, where many new immigrants arrive daily.  There are over 25 nationalities represented among our students. Approximately 50% of our  students are English Language Learners and over 80% come from homes in which languages  other than English are spoken. Chinese (a majority Mandarin, but Cantonese and other Chinese  dialects are represented as well) and Spanish are the major languages spoken by our students, but  we also have students who speak Korean, Pashtu, Urdu, Bengali, Punjabi, Russian, Greek,  Moldovian and Nepali as well as other languages. PS 22 is a Title I school.  Based on the analysis of the NYSESLAT and Citywide Reading /Math Exam Reports,  149  ELLs took the ELA in Spring 2018.  Fifty  ELLs that were tested in grades 3-5 received a 3 or 4  on the ELA. Twenty-three of these students reached Commanding due to their score of a 3 or 4  on the ELA.  Twenty-six ELLs received 3 or 4 on the ELA.  In  3rd grade, 51 out of the  74 ELLs tested received a 3 or 4 on the 2017-2018 NYS Math.  In 4th grade, 32 ELLs out of the  44 ELLs that were tested received a 3 or a 4 on the 2018 NYS Math test.  In fifith grade,  16 out  of 53  ELLs scored 3 or 4 on the 2018  NYS Math.  An analysis of the 2018 NYSESLAT  in  grades 2-5 show that students area of need is reading and writing, but all modalities will be  addressed. These programs are to help students achieve grade level work in ELA and Math, as  well as to help them reach proficiency or progress on the NYSESLAT. All programs will focus  on aiding social emotional development of all students.  All classes are flexibly grouped, some  with non-ELLs and all levels of ELLs, including newcomers, first time test takers and those who  scored Commanding on the NYSESLAT 2018.  A number of ELL students across the grades  have an  IEP or are At-Risk students, SETSS students, students in ICT classes and students in  self-contained Special Education classes; thus the inclusion of special education teachers among  those staffing these programs. Classes will either be co-taught or switched between general  education and ENL teachers 50% of the time. All teachers will be offered 2.25 hours of paid  professional development to collaboratively review data to help drive a cohesive plan for  instruction and to  enhance their ability to understand and use curricula, assessment measures  and instructional strategies for ELL students. The collaboration between teachers will allow the  students to benefit from best teaching practices and varied strategies and scaffolds.  Attendance  will be kept and monitored for each session by the teacher.  All notices to parents will go home  in English, Spanish and Chinese, with copies of all notices to be retained by the program  administrator.   1.  There are 5 ELLs PM programs fully funded by Title III. One teacher instructs each class,  with approximately 7 to 16 students in each class.  Two certified ENL teachers,  1 general  education teacher,  1 Special Education teacher and  1 dually certified ENL/Special Education  teacher will offer direct instruction to select LEP students in grades 2-5 in academic language  development in literacy, math, and other core subjects. Students will also receive instruction in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   the "language" of assessments and of learning both pre and post the students' involvement in all  state assessments [including NYSESLAT]. This program  will take place between October 3,  2018 and May 29, 2019, on two afternoons per week, Wednesday and Thursday.  Supplemental [not used during the school day] materials that will be used are NY ELA/NY Math  Rehearsal Plus (Rally Education, 2015 edition) and Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT  (Attanasio & Associates,) as well as teacher-made lessons using ENL and balanced literacy  instruction strategies such as Interactive Read-Alouds, Thinking Maps, Guided Reading,  Deconstruction/Reconstruction and Word Play with BICS and CALP. Teachers will also  facilitate students' acquisition of English by immersing them in interactive and "Juicy Word  Read Alouds" for vocabulary work and higher order thinking, by incorporating "response to  literature" activities aligned to grade standards, and by engaging in needs-based interactive  SmartBoard lessons and games to enhance their knowledge and facility with English vocabulary  and grammar.   2. There are 6  PM Enrichment programs fully funded by Title III, on Wednesdays, between 2:20  p.m. and 4:05 p.m. The Enrichment program is set to begin on October 3, 2018 and will continue  until May 29, 2019. One teacher will instruct each class, with approximately 7 to 16 students in  each.  Two certified ENL teachers,  2 general education teachers,  1 Special Education teacher  and  1 dually certified ENL/Special Education teacher will offer direct instruction to select LEP  students in grades 2-5 in academic language development in literacy, math, and other core  subjects.This program will aim to enrich student's experiences and help develop students' oral  language and social emotional development.  Students are invited to participate in either Lego  Robotic, Digital Literacy/ Blogging, Science and Literature Enrichment, ELL Enrichment/  Reader's Theater, or Newspaper Club.   3. Approximately 90  fourth and fifth grade ELLs in the program will be invited to see a  Broadway show,  "Wicked",  accompanied by 12 teachers (including ENL teachers and the  drama teacher), and a supervisor. This event will take place on a Saturday, January 26,  2019.  The 100 tickets, the 6 hours per session for the teachers and supervisor, snacks for the  students, and the bus will be paid for with Title III funds for a total of approximately  $12,000.  Students will prepare for this trip by learning about the history of Broadway and NYC,  as well as the story elements present in the show. In preparation, they will view the movie," The  Wizard of Oz," with their ENL teachers and will be responsible for preparing a written and/or  oral exit project based on their experiences. The pre and post lessons will be prepared by ENL  teachers, taught in the PM programs, and will align with ELA and ENL  learning standards in  listening, speaking, reading and writing.                         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69         Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:                The teachers in the program will work together for a total of 2.25 hours to collaboratively  reflect on strategies and share best practices with each other, with the students' ENL teachers and  with classroom teachers, the approaches and scaffolds needed for the grade 2-5 students who will  be taking the NYS ELA, NYS Math and/or NYSESLAT for the first time and also for ENL  students who have demonstrated a need for further instruction to strengthen their listening,  speaking, reading and writing skills. The certified special education teachers will lend  specialized support for teachers whose students have IEPs. Data from the EDAT will be used for  strategic planning as well. For professional development, support will be available from the  Queens North Borough Field Support Center, and the Department of English Language Learners  and Student Support as well as from administration. Teachers attend PD, sessions are full or half  day, and are held in school or at other locations throughout the year at no cost to the Title III  program. Teachers then turnkey information to other teachers in the program as well as to the  entire school on an ongoing timeline. These sessions are 15-30 minute informational sessions  depending on topic, or more in depth sessions that take place on Monday afternoons or on  designated PD days, as well as during common prep time, with distribution of relevant materials.  Topics for professional development will include aligning strands with the TC Workshop model  and Next Generation Learning Standards, parallel instruction to the push-in model, and  implementation of best practices using ENL strategies and techniques. Various assessments will  be discussed and interpretation of data (including most recent NYSESLAT, ELA and Math  results, as well as EDAT and STARS  data) to drive instruction will be emphasized, using item  analysis. Some other PD topics and workshops that teachers will participate in are:  Show and  Tell Writing Unit,  Language Acqusition, Culturally Relevant Teaching,  Spelling Based  Phonics, Assessments for Phonics, Nonfiction Reading and Writing, Public Speaking and  Publication, and Crosswinds between Math and Literacy. The assistant principal maintains a  schedule of in-school PD, including agendas and attendance. In addition, the assistant principal  also keeps a record of PD attended out of building by all teachers, which informs and drives  future in-school PDs.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Early literacy skills of ELLs are assessed using NYSITELL, results of NYSESLAT, Spanish LAB, TCWRP, Stages of Language  Acquisition, performance tasks and teacher observations. The data provides information that informs how these students may  be lacking or have strengths in many areas such as vocabulary, concepts of print and letter and sound recognition. It can also  help us identify SIFE students. In addition, the data helps inform decisions about placement of students. Program and software  decisions are also based on this data. Professional development for both classroom and ENL teachers is geared towards needs  identified by these assessments.  Sixty-six students achieved Commanding on the NYSESLAT 2017. In 3rd and 4th grade, five Expanding students scored a 3 or 4  on the ELA.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74      Running records are analyzed monthly by teachers, administrators, ENL teachers, and other support teachers. ENL teachers  have scheduled monthly meetings with classroom teachers in order to analyze these assessments and to drive differentiated  instruction.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of programs for ELLs is evaluated by analyzing data: NYSESLAT, ELA, NYS Math and Science Assessments, ELL Data  Analysis Tool, Running Records, Writing Continuum, AYPs for ELLs and/or attendance, specifically looking at statistics for ELLs.  Students progress is measured in Math and Reading by analyzing running records and tests.  The Writing Continuum is used to  analyze students' writing using pre and post assessments using TC checklists and rubrics for each writing unit. The conditions  of learning for ELLs in the classroom are observed to ensure that ELA, ESL and Common Core Standards are followed. Stages of  language acquisition are also examined as a measure of ELLs' progress.  Progress for ELLs are measured by analyzing data by  grade and modality.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    After classroom teachers and ENL teachers have analyzed data, observed classroom progress and behaviors, and tried various  Tier 1 RTI interventions, students are brought up to the RTI/AIS team in order to address further interventions.  As of  September 2017, in addition to an IEP Teacher (Jane Mishra), we will have a full-time RTI ELA (Jillian LaManno - also  TESOL certified), RTI Math (Sitsa Xerras),  and a Reading Teacher (Sandra Paolo).  Our lower grade RTI reading teacher is  addressing the needs of the 1st and 2nd graders using the Fountas and Pinnell leveled literacy intervention program. The  leveled lessons include built in running records administered every few lessons taught, in order to continually assess students'  growth and progress. In addition, based on data, a Fundations group of beginner Spanish speaking ELLs with little to no letter  sound recognition has been formed. They will be assessed using the Fundations unit assessments.  Our RTI ELA teacher is also  using the Fountas and Pinnell leveled literacy intervention program with the students that preformed in the bottom third  based on the standardized ELA exam.  Our IEP teacher is implementing the SPIRE reading program. An initial placement  assessment is given to form small groups in order to drive her instruction. Decoding, pre and post assessments are used to  determine pacing and mastery.  There are also timed fluency drills to measure progress and fluency.  The students that were in  the bottom third from the data gathered from the Math standardized test for Grades 3, 4 and 5 receive AIS services from  the RTI Math teacher. The RTI Math teacher is using resources from Think Central as well as supplemental materials from Go  Math.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The first step in acquiring data about an ELL is to study the student's HLIS form to uncover factors that could influence the  English language learning process. Other sources of data are the NYSITELL, results of NYSESLAT, Spanish LAB and TCWRP  Running Records. Students who are not showing sufficient progress in necessary skills and competencies receive more  differentiated instruction based on identification of the specific skills that are lacking. Our school implements  the RTI framework by supporting skills in reading, writing, listening and speaking. Strategies to help build ELLs' language  development might include: building background knowledge, close reading, interactive read-alouds, visual supports, bilingual  dictionaries and glossaries, scaffolding complex texts, sentence/discussion prompts, linguistic frames, storytelling with  wordless books, role playing, intensive vocabulary instruction, interactive and shared writing, and reading and spelling  instruction based on phonemic awareness, phonics and sight words. These strategies also take into consideration the  necessary cultural and linguistic needs of our students.  Also, this instruction makes appropriate connections to  ELLs community values and identities in order to accommodate the needs of our students and their families.  Targeted lower  grade students receive double-dose Fundations.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   According to the analysis of the 2017 NYSESLAT data shows 476 English Language Learners. The total number of ELLs includes  90 students who scored Commanding  from the 2016 and 2017 NYSESLAT.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75         In grades 1 through 5, the majority of students are at the Expanding level (60 - 1  st  grade, 44 - 2  nd   grade, 48 -3  rd   grade,  35 -4  th   grade and 28 -5  th   grade.)  Five Expanding students in the 3rd and 4th grade are Commanding due to scoring a 3 or  a 4 on the 2017 ELA.   Nine Expanding students in the 5th grade are Commanding due scoring a 3 or 4 on the 2017 ELA.  These  students will continue to receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL services.  In Kindergarten, the 2017 NYSITELL data shows that  most students are Entering and Emerging.   The greatest number of English Language Learners remains in the lower grades,  Kindergarten through 2nd grade.      The ENL teachers gather and analyze student data from the RLAT.  The teachers determine the strength and weaknesses for  each student by examining each modality in order to drive rigorous instruction for our ELLs.  Through congruence with the  classroom teachers, ENL teachers are able to access and utilize results from running records, and other assessments in order to  differentiate instruction.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teachers analyze the results in order to group students according to the Stages of Language Acquisition.  Based on the assessment results, ENL teaches are assigned accordingly across the grades. Presently, we have eight ENL  teachers, two bilingual teachers, and one self-contained ENL teacher in order to meet the needs of our ELL  population.  ENL and classroom teachers have scheduled, monthly ENL congruence meetings to discuss observations and  findings, which drives small group and classroom instruction.  During congruence, classroom and ENL teachers meet in order to  discuss student progress, readjustment of small groups as needed, students' social and emotional development based on  stages of language acquisition as per the data.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   PS 22 has a Freestanding ENL Program in which all entitled students are served in a collaborative push-in instructional  model. In addition, ELLs receive instruction in a pull-out environment twice a day in a small group, focusing on  Entering, Emerging and Transitioning students.  To ensure consistency and alignment of instruction and planning, and  to assure that the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided as per CR Part 154, there are two or more  dedicated ENL classes on each grade, with at least one ENL teacher assigned to the grade whenever possible. Students  are grouped based on data from the NYSESLAT, information from congruence meetings, observations, and other  student data based on formative and summative assessments. PS 22 has eight full-time, fully certified ENL  teachers.  All mainstream classes at PS 22 are heterogeneous and travel in a block; most classes with entitled students  include students in all proficiency levels (Entering through Commanding), with a few having only Transitioning,  Expanding , and Commanding students. Most classes also have some English speaking students as well. PS 22 runs on  a 7-school day, 50 minute period schedule. Across a month, ENL teachers spend a minimum of either 360 or 180  minutes per week in each class delivering explicit ENL instruction. Classroom teachers provide the ELA instruction.  Entitled ELLs in ICT and self-contained Special Education classes are fully served as per their IEPs.                b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     The TBE programs follow the same daily schedules as general education/ENL classes on their grades. Students in those  classes are ELLs of all proficiency levels. Both classes include (as per CR Part 154) a language arts instruction  component including both Mandarin and English, an ENL component and a bilingual content area instructional  component. All instruction is Common Core Learning Standards aligned.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76         c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not applicable   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Students are served between 90-360 minutes in a stand-alone and integrated ENL depending on their level of language  acquisition.  ENL instruction is delivered by a certified ENL teacher.  Entering students receive 360 minutes, 180 minute in  stand-alone.  Students who are newcomer to the country receive one or two 50-minutes periods of explicit language  instruction in a pull-out setting.  Emerging students are served 90 minutes in stand-alone ENL (which includes explicit language  instruction in a pull-out setting), 180 minutes of integrated instruction, which includes reading, writing and word study, and 90  minutes in integrated ENL in other content areas including math, science and social studies. Transitioning students are served  90 minutes in integrated ENL and 90 minutes in stand-alone  or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content areas.  The  Advanced students are served 180 minutes in integrated ENL/ELA or another content area. Commanding students are served  90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or any other content area.  In the TBE classroom, students are taught content areas, Math  and Social Studies classes, in Chinese.  Native language support is provided by the Bilingual teacher and home language is  visible in the classroom through vocabulary cards and labels. The Bilingual teachers activates prior knowledge by connecting  literacy and content through interactive read-alouds and classroom discussions in the home language.  Several ENL teachers  are also bilingual and offer support to students and parents.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   ENL and bilingual teachers refer to NYS Learning standards-based content area curriculum calendars for all subject areas,  incorporating ENL strategic methodologies and instructional strategies alongside ELA methodologies to provide a balanced  literacy program that is aligned with Common Core standards in ENL, ELA and content areas. Explicit ENL and scaffolded  content area instruction are delivered in English in whole class, small group and individual settings, with planning based on  curriculum calendars and ongoing assessments, both formal and informal. ENL teachers accompany their classes to selected  Science periods in an effort to make the content comprehensible, to build academic language, both written and oral and to  promote students' participation in academic conversations and collaborations. More than half of the ENL teachers are bilingual  and offer support to students, parents and staff with academics and other issues. Bilingual books, glossaries (math, science  and social studies) and dictionaries are available and used by students, teachers, paraprofessionals and parents to help make  content comprehensible. A variety of approaches and methods are used by both classroom and ENL teachers such as Shared  Reading, Guided Reading, Shared Writing, Interactive Writing, Deconstruction/Reconstruction, Mapping Meaning to Text,  Demystifying Figurative Language, Total Physical Response and Word Play with BICS and CALP. Charts modeling correct  language usage and content vocabulary, as well as various thinking maps are integral part of instruction at PS 22. Classroom  teachers and ENL teachers sometimes share the whole class instruction through parallel teaching, station teaching, team  teaching or the one teach one observe models, in order to further enrich language development for all students. ENL teachers  accompany their classes to the science class once or twice a week.  All instruction is co-planned by a classroom and  ENL teacher with a language goal and content goal aligned to the teaching point of the lesson.     In the TBE classes, the classroom teacher delivers the ENL component in English and Chinese. In the TBE classroom, students  are taught content areas, Math and Social Studies classes, in Chinese.  Native language support is provided by the Bilingual  teacher and home language is visible in the classroom through vocabulary cards and labels. The Bilingual teachers activates  prior knowledge by connecting literacy and content through interactive read-alouds and classroom discussions in the home  language.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   In an effort to evaluate ELLs' abilities in their native language, we talk to parents and students at registration, use the HLIS  to  look at prior education (including any documentation brought from the native country), administer the Spanish LAB and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77      informally evaluate wherever possible.  More than half of our ENL teachers are bilingual and are able to assist classroom  teachers in evaluating student work throughout the year. Whenever possible, a teacher fluent in the home language will also  help to scaffold content for the student. In the TBE classes, the teachers are planning to create and administer periodic  assessments (examples are Chinese character recognition assessment, sentence building assessment) throughout the year in  order to evaluate the students in their home language.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.  SIFE students receive the mandated ENL instructional time. In addition, depending on their individual needs for instruction  in language arts and/or mathematics, they receive additional instruction during Title III and At Risk programs. Where possible,  a teacher fluent in the SIFE's language will also help to scaffold content for the student as well as emotional support.  There is  also an ENL teacher who is trained in the Wilson Program. Currently there are 6 SIFE students at PS 22.        b.  Newcomers receive the mandated ENL instructional time, which includes differentiated small group instruction based on  both formal and informal assessments. Scaffolds such as pictures, charts, and realia, as well as computer-based instruction  such as More Starfall, Imagine Learning, and Brain Pop ESL are an integral part of the newcomer program. Traditional ENL texts  may be used when appropriate. During the writing period, newcomers are offered paper suited to their level of English  proficiency. They are encouraged to write in their native language at first and to add English as they learn. Teachers of ELLs  often place them in triads where they can listen to peers as models. Some also receive additional instruction in Title III  programs. Students who will be taking the ELA for the first time receive additional instruction to help them become  accustomed to the exam. There are extra teaching periods in some ENL teachers' schedules which may be devoted to working  with newcomers.        c-d.  Developing and Long-Term ELLs receive the mandated ENL instructional time for their proficiency level on the NYSESLAT.  Small group differentiated instruction is provided by both the classroom and the ENL teacher during the school day and in Title  III programs. Based on formal and informal assessments such as NYSESLAT, performance tasks, and teacher-made  assessments,  students in these categories will receive specific strategy lessons in listening, speaking, reading and/or writing.  To help meet the performance standards in listening, students listen to books on tape or computer based listening websites,  play listening games and take part in additional read aloud and explicit listening strategy lessons. Small group and individual  instruction for speaking skills include choral reading, Readers Theater, dialogues, repetition drills and formal and informal  conversations with teachers and peers. Students who need help meeting performance standards in reading may be involved in  commercial programs such as Imagine Learning, Starfall, Fundations, Words Their Way, and Scholastic Guided Reading. These  students, who often have fluency but lack academic language, receive focused strategy lessons in academic vocabulary and  usage. Additional personnel such as the RTI ELA teacher(Jillian LaManno), RTI Math (Sitsa Xerras), and Reading Teacher (Sandra  Paolo) help to further differentiate instruction for these students. ENL teachers might also confer with Special Education  teachers, speech teachers or members of the SBST to collaborate on ideas for helping these students. Ongoing testing with  Running Records checks their reading progress frequently and helps to drive instruction. Pre-teaching of content area  vocabulary also aids in content area comprehension for these students. To help students meet performance standards in  writing, students might also (in addition to the strategies listed above) receive explicit instruction in writing development,  organization, language use and mechanics.    e. Former ELLs receive testing accommodations for 2 years following their testing Proficient/Commanding on the NYSESLAT. In  year 1, those students are usually placed in a general education ENL classroom where an ENL teacher will be pushing in for 360  or 180 minutes per week, affording them the same co-teaching scaffolds as the current ELLs. All ELLs were invited take part in  Extended Day programs, Saturday Enrichment programs, other before and after school academic programs offered at PS 22.  ENL and classroom teachers are aware of who these students are and pay specific attention to their language acquisition skills  as well as their academic skills and place them strategically in small groups to reinforce and teach.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Students With Disabilities and ELL-SWDs at PS 22 are served by the same intervention programs as non-ELLs. For all subjects,  students are served with differentiated instruction provided by classroom teachers, ENL teachers and support staff, using  programs such as Fundations and Scholastic Guided Reading. All classrooms have leveled libraries to meet the needs of all  students. There are At Risk and SETTS programs. Go Math is used at PS 22; the Spanish version is used, as well as the  Differentiation Handbook to individualize lessons for ELLs. Go Math also has many interventions on many different levels,  including RTI lessons. Math manipulatives help to make math content comprehensible at all levels. Bilingual glossaries (science,  social studies, math) are available in many languages and are distributed for classroom and home use. Bilingual dictionaries are  available in all classrooms.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school supports ELL-SWDs by making sure scheduling is arranged so that ENL and other services such as OT or speech do  not overlap. ENL teachers are aware of SWD's IEP goals and work towards meeting those as well as towards English proficiency  goals. ENL programs are arranged so that the the ENL teacher is present in all subject areas during the required ENL minutes.  There are 2 self-contained special education classes at PS 22; ENL students in those classes are served by the same standards  as students in general education or ICT classes. We currently have a part-time Spanish Bilingual Speech Therapist as well as a  full-time Monolingual English Speech Therapist.  The Title III  before and after school programs are offered to ELLs and ELL- SWDs.   Strategies to help build ELLs-SWDs language development might include: building background knowledge, close  reading, interactive read-alouds, visual supports, bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, scaffolding complex texts,  sentence/discussion prompts, linguistic frames, storytelling with wordless books, role playing, intensive vocabulary instruction,  interactive and shared writing, and reading and spelling instruction based on phonemic awareness, phonics and sight  words. Classroom and ENL teachers meet for planning and analysis of student work to ensure that students are progressing  and to differentiate instruction according to the students' needs.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Due to our large ELL population, ELLs are included in all intervention programs.  Programs include At Risk/ SETTS provided by  the IEP Teacher (Jane Mishra) who will be implementing Double Dose Fundations, SPIRE, and Great Leaps. We will have a  lower-grade Reading Teacher (Sandra Paolo) who plans to be utilizing Recipe for Reading and Fundations.   We will also have  RTI Math teacher (Sista Xerras) who will be using tools from Go Math. We will have a RTI ELA teacher (Jillian LaManno) who  may be using Leveled Literacy Intervention and Fundations. In addition, we also have some SWD/ELL with language  paraprofessionals (Chinese, Spanish, Korean). We have a part-time Spanish Bilingual Speech Therapist and a full-time  Monolingual English Speech Therapist.  Our School Based Support Team consists of a Bilingual Chinese Psychologist, a Bilingual  Spanish Social Worker, and a Bilingual Spanish Family Worker.  Also see #6 and 9.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      According to the data collected from EDAT we noticed that 30% of our ELLs who took the NYSESLAT 2017  advanced at least  one proficiency level. Twenty-four students advanced two or more proficiency levels. Only 4% of the students regressed one  proficiency and no students regressed two or more proficiency levels.  Based on the EDAT, we noticed that the strongest  modality in 1st grade was reading.  The strongest modality in 3rd grade was speaking. The modality of need in 2nd, 3th, and  5th grade was writing. Only five students scored low across modalities in 4th grade.     Moving forward, instruction will be geared towards improving students' writing in all units of study as well as preparation for  the upcoming NYSESLAT and ELA.  Especially for 1st and 2nd grade, we will focus on text complexity and developing reading  and writing stamina as test takers.     PS 22 is engaged in new programs including Spire (intensive Reading intervention for non-readers and struggling readers),  Leveled Literacy Intervention (provides small group intensive literacy instruction), and Great Leaps (the IEP teacher and  academic paraprofessionals have been trained to implement this program).   Teachers are working on and delivering new and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79      creative workshops in order to meet the needs of our parents and students. In addition, family nights will be added to the  school calendar.  The drama teacher, aided by the PTA will plan several assembly events for all grades in order to improve  student engagement and foster a sense of community.  We now have a full-time staff developer (Jeanne Powers) who will  focus on ELL strategies in accordance to our school-wide instructional focus, which is to improve instruction and scaffolding  techniques for ELLs and SWDs.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   PS 22 currently has no plans to discontinue any programs/services for ELLS.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are given the same opportunities as all other students to participate in after school and supplemental services whether  the programs are universal or based on need. Parents receive notification and brochures in various home languages. Such  programs include chorus, art club, student government, drama, and Title III ENL.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   PS 22 uses a balanced literacy program; books on all levels are available for all classrooms. Native language books in fiction  and non-fiction are available as well for both the independent reading period and to support content area. All classes use the  Passport to Social Studies program for social studies and the NYC Full Year Trade Book Program, which help to make the  content more comprehensible for ELLs. Go Math is used throughout the school, enriched with manipulatives and many  differentiation models. The Foss Program is used for science in all grades; where all students can learn through hands-on  activities, usually accompanied to science class by their ENL teachers. All classes receive hands-on instruction in technology  using computers, laptops, and iPads in the classrooms. All classrooms, including ENL and Special Education rooms, have  SmartBoards which are used for hands-on internet-based instruction and as a visual aid during instruction. ENL teachers bring  other resources such as realia, posters, picture cards and alternate texts to the classroom to help enrich language and make  the content more comprehensible.          13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In the Freestanding ENL push-in model, native language support is provided through books (bilingual dictionaries, glossaries,  dual language and native language literature.) Students are placed in partnerships and triads for instruction, collaboration and  discussion, often with one or more proficient peers who speak the same language. PS 22 is a culturally diverse school and  literature and lessons reflect our sensitivity to the backgrounds of our many ELLs and their families. In the TBE classroom,  students are taught content area, Math and Social Studies, in Chinese.  Native language support is provided by the Bilingual  teacher and home language is visible in the classroom through vocabulary cards and labels. The Bilingual teachers activates  prior knowledge by connecting literacy and content through interactive read-alouds and classroom discussions in the home  language.  Several ENL teachers are also bilingual and offer support to students and parents. There are some SWD/ELL with  language paraprofessionals. We have a part-time Spanish Bilingual Speech Therapist and a full-time Monolingual English  Speech Therapist.  Our School Based Support Team consists of a Bilingual Chinese Psychologist, a Bilingual Spanish Social  Worker, and a Bilingual Spanish Family Worker.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All programs, placements, required services, resources and instruction at PS 22 are age and grade appropriate, providing  standard bearing grade level instruction. Information gleaned from entrance interviews and the HLIS form help to inform these  decisions.  We have eight ENL teachers in order to effectively support ELLs at each grade level by providing grade and age  appropriate instruction.  Since the ENL teachers are mostly assigned to specific grades, they are able to focus on their  particular grade.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   The Parent Coordinator (Lilliana Coltelli) advertises public library programs, community connections and other various  resources and activities available for families. She is always available to parents who need help. Many kindergarten students  are tested in June affording them an early introduction to PS 22. There is a Kindergarten Orientation, Meet the Teacher night  (all teachers and staff), and ELL Parent Orientations (all ENL teachers) for newly enrolled ELLs. ENL teachers pay special  attention to newly enrolled students, often taking them on a tour of the school and introducing them to peers who speak their  language. Newly enrolled students at any time of the year are met in the main office by an ENL teacher to help with the  registration process.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    At this time, PS 22 offers a Freestanding ENL Program and a TBE Program in Mandarin Chinese (in Kindergarten and 1st  grade).  We have no other language electives.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Since the percentage of native English speakers at PS 22 is so small, all teachers and staff at PS 22 are considered teachers of  ELLs, whether classroom teachers, cluster teachers or ENL teachers  Therefore, many of the professional development  planned focuses on the needs of the ELLs. Turnkey workshops within the school  are scheduled in order to share information  during Monday afternoon professional development. Teachers are surveyed at the beginning of the year to determine who  exhibits best practices in various areas, then teachers are matched for inter-visitation based on needs.  All teachers of ELLs and  non-pedagogic staff who attend meetings and conferences outside the building turnkey to the staff on the following Monday  afternoon of the attended workshop. PS 22 is a Project School for 2017-2018. TCRWP staff developers have created lab sites  and discussion groups by interest and/or grade within the school which all classroom and ENL teachers attend. All teachers  have access to online support and resources through TCRWP, Go Math, and various webinars. Various inquiry teams were  developed dealing with the special needs of the students in the school.  The professional book clubs meet to have open book  discussions. Many books focus on topics surrounding ELLs.     Professional development is provided through various means, much of it focused on Common Core Learning Standards and  how to support ELLs as they engage in Common Core. Beginning with the 2017-18 school year, PS 22 will have a full time staff  developer, Jeanne Powers, who will attend workshops and then provide in house PD on various topics as well as coordinate  materials for teachers. Outside of the school, the Division of English Language Learners and Students Support and other DOE  offices offer many opportunities for study which teachers take advantage of. Similarly, the Teachers College Reading Writing  Project offers workshops which many teachers attend. TCRWP staff developers makes sure to address the ELLs during all  meetings when planning for reading and writing. ELL Compliance and Performance Specialists support ENL teachers and  administration by ensuring that mandates are met and that ELLs and their parents are receiving all services to which they are  entitled. The Queens North Borough Field Support Center offer ENL workshops and are available to teachers to answer any ELL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81         related questions and issues.  Many ENL teachers have visited the Field Support Center for various workshops and  meeting.  They are also involved in on-going study groups such as TCRWP study group for grammar and ELL Workshop Series  with Maryann Cucchiara. Two ENL teachers (one upper grade, one lower grade) will attend the Passport to Social Studies ENL  support workshops.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Administration has a Professional Learning Plan in place for Mondays Professional Development.  Teachers are required to sign  an attendance sheet for each meeting which Administration keeps on file as well as an agenda. ENL teachers provide training  and workshops for their grade, as well as for the whole school.  Teachers are sent to TCRWP calendar and study groups  focusing on ELL related topics.  The majority of the professional development attended by ENL teachers specifically  addresses  the need of ELLS and ELA  instruction. All teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic staff who attend meetings and  conferences outside the building turnkey to the staff on the following Monday afternoon of the attended workshop which  include ELL-specific professional development.        Parental Involvement      1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   As per the CR Part 154, each ENL teacher is responsible to hold an annual meeting with each parent or guardian.  Each teacher  will be responsible to schedule his own meetings, as well as keeping his own record of these meetings. In the meetings, the  goals of the program, language development needs in all content areas will be discussed during the annual individual meetings  with parents of ELLs.  NYSESLAT data, their child's stage of language acquisition and language development will be explained  and discusses.  Also, strategies will be discussed in order to bridge the gap between the classroom and the  home.  Interpretation and translation will be provided as needed through the use of the phone translation service or with the  help of bilingual staff members.  Meetings will be held in person or by phone.             2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  As stated above, PS 22 has a PTA which holds monthly meetings and activities. Students who have been chosen as "Student of  the Month," are presented with certificates at these meetings. Various family activity nights and afternoons (PJ & A Book,  Multi-Cultural Night (May 23rd), Fall Festival (October 24th), Flea Market (November 18th), Bingo Night, choral and  instrumental concerts, dance performances) are held throughout the year. During Multi-Cultural Night, parents are asked to  bring in a dish to share that represents their culture.  There are also arts and crafts centers for teachers, parents and students  to work together in order to teach each other about different traditions and cultures. This year we are hosting a Flea Market in  order to give back to our community. School staff and faculty will be donating household items, toys, clothing, etc. for the  event.   This year we are starting a monthly Saturday Fun Day program where parents are invited to come with their children  to be involved in various engaging extracurricular activities including arts and crafts, cooking, physical fitness, and literature  circles.       Other parent meetings are held throughout the year on topics such as writing, understanding state assessments or disciplining  your child. Parents are invited to accompany class trips. The PS 22 ENL Department has created an ENL Report Card which is  sent home along with the classroom teacher's report card so parents can be made aware of their child's progress in language  acquisition as well as in content area. All report cards are translated into Chinese, Korean and Spanish, the three dominant  languages at PS 22.  ENL teachers hold workshops specifically geared towards ELL parents, as well as holding  individual meetings. Many teachers have their own websites; many teachers offer email access to parents. PS 22 has a school  website with links to other sites of interest and assistance to parents.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jennifer Meyer, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          84                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 22Q Thomas Jefferson                                                                              School DBN: 25Q022  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
