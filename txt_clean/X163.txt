This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Our mission at P.S. 163 is to accommodate, respect and support the individual learning styles and needs of our  students through small group instruction. We will work collaboratively to create a safe nurturing child centered  environment that fosters a sense of belonging, high academic standard and achievement.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Utilizing the highest quality teaching methods, tools, and materials our highly qualified educators provide instruction  and motivation for students to perform their very best. At P.S. 163 the student body is served by 56 licensed  professionals including one (1) principal, one (1) assistant principals, one (1) guidance counselor, and forty-five  teachers, (including one full time universal literacy coach funded by the DOE) Additional support personnel includes:  sixteen (16) paraprofessionals, five (5) school aides, one (1) secretary, and two (2) family workers.    Our School Community    P.S. 163 is a Pre-K through Grade 5, elementary school, located in the South Bronx, one of the poorest congressional  districts in New York City (N.Y.C.). P.S. 163 is located in the Tremont section of the Bronx and is part of Community  School District 9.    The school’s current enrollment is 475 students which is well over the building’s capacity. The school’s pupil ethnic  demographics are as follows: 61.5% Hispanic, 36% Black, 1.4% Asian/Pacific Islander, 1% American Indian or Alaska  Native and .0.4% White. The Hispanic population is composed of either new immigrants or first generation Americans.  Approximately 80% come from homes in which languages other than English is spoken. The most predominant  language spoken by our students other than English is Spanish. 34% of our students are English Language Learners  (ELL). 18% of our student body are students with Special Needs. The great majority of our students are from low- income families and 96.5 % of our students are eligible for free lunch. As a result, P.S. 163 is designated as a Title I  school.   P.S. 163 is composed of a main building and 4 transportable units in the school yard. The main building houses 19 of  the 25 classes. There are eight (8) classrooms located in 4 transportable units in the upper school yard. Specifically,  we have: 1 full day Pre-Kindergarten class, four (4) full day Kindergarten classes, three (3) first grade classes, five (5)  second grade classes, four (4) third grade classes, four (4) fourth grade classes, four (4) fifth grade classes. Additionally  we have seven (7) self-contained special education classes, across grades K-5.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   33% of our school's population are English language learners. English language learners receive English as a New  Language (ENL) support in Transitional bilingual or self contained ENL classrooms.       18% of our student body are students with disabilities. We offer students with Individualized Education Plans (IEPs)  services in SDI (Specially Designed Instruction) for them to progress and access the general education curriculum.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   School Strengths, Accomplishments and Challenges   Strengths:   According to the New York State Education Department (NYSED), our current school accountability status for the  2017-2018 year indicates that we are in good standing for having met the targeted Annual Measurable Objectives in  2016-2017. This is pending the 2017-2018 school accountability report.       A review of the Framework for Great Schools Report (2017-2018) indicates that we have improved in 3 out of the 6  areas from the previous school year. However,it clearly identified as our strength is Rigorous Instruction scoring a 3.06   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      on the rubric. This is further supported by the School Environment Survey which indicates that we have an achieved  87% positive responses.       Accomplishments:      P.S. 163 is proud to be 1 of 113 schools nationwide and 1 of 6 schools in New York City, that were awarded   the Apple ConnectED grant. Apple ConnectED is part of a White House initiative that aims to support the  school’s educational goals with technology. “Through this grant every student at P.S. 163 has been issued an  iPad, allowing students to connect with topics and express themselves like never before. To further support  our quest for "Reimaging teaching and Learning" every teacher and administrator received an iPad and a  Macbook to help support and inspire our students. Additionally, every classroom was equipped with an Apple  TV to help students immerse themselves in the educational content they discover and the work they create.”  We are further supported by the Apple Education team that was assigned to support our school with this  initiative. The Apple Education Team works closely with the Core Planning Teams to make sure that our  school’s technical and educational needs are considered and that their strategies are executed successfully. In  addition, a professional development specialist will also help ensure that teachers are prepared to integrate  technology into their curriculum.     P.S. 163 has been making steady progress in the area of English Language Arts. Since 2013 the number of  students at proficiency levels and above has increased steadily. The most significant factor is that we are  narrowing the gap between P.S. 163 and N.Y.C. schools.

Instructional Shifts and the Danielson Framework for Teaching. As a school community, we will focus on  developing teacher effectiveness in Demonstrating Knowledge of content Pedagogy, Using questioning and discussion  techniques and Using data assessments to drive instruction. Through small group instruction the teachers will create  lessons that engage the students in higher order thinking and meets the needs of all learners so that all students can  produce meaningful work products.      For the 2018-20179 our school has adopted the following Theory of Action:      "If every teacher’s written plans include questions formulated at the four Depths of Knowledge and students are  provided with multiple opportunities during the course of the lesson to justify or clarify their thinking, challenge the  thinking of their peers in respectful ways, and pose questions of their own to extend the discussion, then we will see  an increase in student intellectual engagement as well as deeper understanding resulting in improved student  achievement across PS 163."                   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 09X163   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   481   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     The school's strengths are:       .The school’s English Language Arts instruction is organized and implemented through the Teachers College reading  and writing curriculum. Teachers implement the Curricular Plan for the Reading Workshop. Teachers also implement  Units of Study in Opinion, Information, and Narrative Writing.      Each pacing calendar provides teachers with an overview of the units, ideas for planning, and Common Core   Learning Standards (CCLS), including standards for foundational skills. The unit plans also include what the  students will learn, possible CCLS exemplar texts, suggested charts, key vocabulary, assessment, and possible  mini-lessons.   Teachers use the New York City Department of Education’s Scope and Sequence guides in science and social studies  to guide their content area instruction. We have purchase the Amplify Science curriculum this year and will continue  to us the Passport curriculum for social studies.       Findings:     According to June 2018 preliminary cut scores and the teachers’ end of year MOTP rating in the Danielson   Framework for Teaching, the Advance system, the following was concluded:      P.S. 163 needs to decrease the number of Level 1 students in the New York State ELA and Math exams. The   majority of our teachers scored developing at the end of the school year in Advance components:      1e – Designing Coherent Instruction    3b – Questioning and Discussion     3c - Engaging Students in Instruction    3d – Using Assessment in Instruction     Impact:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14      P.S. 163 will decrease the Level 1’s on the NYS ELA and Math assessments. Teachers will be provided Professional  Development in content subject areas, Asking Better Questions and Using data to drive instruction.       The following is the evidence cited in our school’s State assessment data and teachers’ end of year MOTP report:         According to the NYS ELA and Math exams the school has increase their Level 1’s by 3%.     The school has decreased their Level 4’s in Math by 1%.    The math instructional period of 45 minutes was insufficient.    The majority of the teachers’ end of year MOTP rating was developing and the students’ end of year MOSL   has consistently brought their overall rating to effective in the last 3 years.      Teachers develop and share scaffolds and differentiated practices to support the learning needs of diverse   learning subgroups, such as students with disabilities and English language learners. Teachers develop  questions using Webb’s Depth of Knowledge levels for their lessons.     Grade level teams review the units and students' work samples and make adjustments to the plans, as   needed.     Arts for All (2 Kindergarten Classes, 2 First Grade Classes and 2 Second Grade Classes)    Cloud 9 World Lessons are implemented across all grade levels to support PBIS social emotional curriculum.    To supplement the Go Math! curriculum we will be utilizing Eureka Math.     A math and ELA educational consultant will be hired to support teachers in their implementation of the   curriculum.   If we provide PD on professional learning opportunities to strengthen teachers instructional proficiency in using data  to plan instructions with a focus on content knowledge and questioning discourse, as well as analyzing data, then  teachers will be able to provide targeted instruction in all content areas resulting in a decrease in Level 1 performance  and an increase in proficiency.

PS 163 believes and understands that parents play a vital role in the growth and development of their children. Our  Parent Teacher Association (PTA) in conjunction with our Parent Coordinator work seamlessly to ensure that our  families feel supported and included in the education of their children. Parents are not only participants in our School  Leadership team (SLT) but engaged in Shared Decision-Making at the school. They serve as volunteers during Arrival  and Dismissal and even work shoulder to shoulder with us in our student cafeteria to ensure that our students are  supervised, nurtured, supported, and safe during lunch and recess.       The Home/School Connection is essential to PS 163 in addition to our daily interface with our families during Arrival  and Dismissal we produce a Monthly Newsletter to share important dates. Information about the Teaching and  Learning parents should expect to see at each grade level and subject but also resources and points of contact for our  families.       On a monthly basis our Parent Coordinator organized Workshops and Learning Experiences that provide our families  with the information and resources they need to further support their children at home. In fact, many of the  workshops and activities we have planned for them in 2018-2019 are aligned to the Instructional Focus: Create,  maintain and sustain a culture for learning in every classroom using PBIS to reach ALL students by fostering P.R.I.D.E.

In May 2016, PS 163 underwent a Quality Review led by a Central Reviewer. The reviewer concluded the following:    Findings:   The majority of teachers are engaged in structured, inquiry-based professional collaborations that promote the  achievement of school goals and the implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards, including the  instructional shifts. Teacher teams consistently analyze assessment data and student work. Distributed leadership  structures are in place so that teachers have built leadership capacity and have a voice in key decisions that affect  student learning across the school.      Impact: The school’s instructional practices promote high levels of student engagement and inquiry, thus leading to  increased student achievement and the meeting of student goals.     Evidence Discussed with the Principal:     The teachers on the kindergarten teacher team that was observed shared that they have designated a team  facilitator, for example, but that they may rotate and share roles and responsibilities, when necessary, with a  unified sense of purpose and collegial support for each other. They explained how they collaborate and  support each other even beyond the scheduled meeting times that the school leaders have established. They  visit each others' classes to learn from colleagues.     Teachers on the kindergarten teacher team and teachers in grade 4 volunteered to participate in a   remarkable professional opportunity that was presented to them, namely the Teacher Rounds processes and  protocols. They have identified a problem of practice, and they have demonstrated their sincere commitment  to improved instructional practices and student outcomes by their willingness to take learning risks with their  colleagues. One of the very powerful ways that they “put themselves out there” in the spirit of  professionalism and commitment to learning is by videotaping themselves during their teaching and sharing  these videos with colleagues for examination and reflection, including, of course, self-reflection.     The teachers who are participating in the Teacher Rounds initiative attend monthly visits to other schools and  collaborate with other teachers in the district who are also participating in this initiative. The teachers receive  professional development training from consultants from Harvard University.     The principal shared that all teacher teams have selected a focus for professional inquiry and development.  All foci are aligned to best practices, aligned to Common Core Learning Standards and rigorous instruction.  For example, teachers in grades 1, 2, and 3 focus on close reading with non-fiction texts. Grade 5 teachers are  focusing on total participation techniques. Kindergarten teachers focus on vocabulary development to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          26      support students’ engagement in accountable talk. Grade 4 teachers are focusing on engagement through  questioning and discussion.     Teachers on the teacher team expressed great appreciation for the support they receive from the principal.  As a teacher shared, “The principal is always giving us tools to get better, to learn, and better our teaching.”  The other teachers shared this sentiment, as well. They emphatically concurred and exuberantly expressed  appreciation of the school’s culture of professionalism and collegiality.     The Principal's office was filled with multiple copies of cutting-edge, research-based professional texts that   are used to support the teachers’ professional development. These texts were well-selected and were directly  aligned to the school’s instructional focus and reflective of the professional needs of the teachers in the  school. This smart and strategic leadership support for the complex and demanding challenges that teachers  face is worth noticing and noting (as one of the professional texts is titled Notice and Note by Beers and  Probst).     In order for the school's strategy and practices to align with the concepts in the tenets and statements of practice in  the above area, the school should:   1.  School leaders should encourage their work derived from professional development opportunities, where  teachers would share their work at a full faculty meeting which will allow other teachers to hear from each  other and better understand their colleagues’ learning journeys and work. Teachers’ sharing their experiences  will serve as an honest lens for their own self-reflection and for meaningful collaborative dialogue.              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.  By June 2019, teachers will continue working in collabative teams with consultants to improve instructional practice in  the areas of P.R.I.D.E (Pupil Centered, Responsive and Rigorous, Innovative, Differentiated and Engaging Instruction),  based on the 2018 MOTP report, between 51 -60% of teachers are developing in Domains 1 and 3, as a result teacher's  effectiveness will increase by 10% to an Effective ratings.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          27   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Reflection:   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) School Survey report for 2017-2018 provides a detailed insight  into the progress achieved by P.S. 163 in establishing an enriching and vibrant relationship between each student’s  home and school networks of support which are critical to establishing an environment of student learning and  growth. The report data indicates an overall 86% “Positive Responses” by families providing input through the survey  process.       Review of additional survey questions (with a focus on “Strongly agree” or “agree”) such as the following provide  additional data:         "School staff regularly communicate with parents/guardians about how parents can help students  learn."(89% of family respondents strongly agree or agree. )  "Parents/guardians are invited to visit classrooms to observe instruction." (85% of family respondents  strongly agree or agree. )   Strengths:   At P.S. 163 we believe the education of a child requires the participation of the entire school community. Key to this  endeavor is the involvement and input of the families who decide to make P.S. 163 a part of their child’s growth as a  student and as a person. We believe this can be achieved through ongoing and developing dialogue between all  members of the school community. An indicator of the connectedness between the home and school community is  provided in the number of school families that voluntarily participate in school meetings and conferences scheduled  throughout the year. Review of additional survey questions (with a focus on “Strongly agree” or “agree”) such as the  following provide additional data:               “Parents/guardians are greeted warmly when they call or visit the school. (95% of family respondents strongly  agree or agree.)  “Teachers communicate regularly with parents/guardians" (94 % of family respondents strongly agree or  agree.)  Satisfied with "The education my child has received this year." (97% of family respondents strongly agree or  agree.)  "I trust the principal/school leader at his or her word (to  do what he or she says that he or she will do)." (94% of family respondents strongly agree or agree.)   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34         "The Principal at this school is strongly committed to shared decision making." (96% of family respondents  strongly agree or agree.)   Needs:    We believe that greater participation can provide all members of the P.S. 163 learning community with an insight as  to the degree families are receiving the opportunity to participate in the overall operation of our school and therefore  this opportunity will inspire them to demonstrate their willingness to provide input through participation throughout  all aspects of their child’s learning experience at P.S. 163. A question from the survey that speaks to an area of  potential increase in regard to positive response and engagement of P.S. 163 families is as follows:         Since the beginning of the school year, how often have you been asked or had the opportunity to volunteer  time to support this school (for example, spent time helping in classrooms, helped with school-wide events,  etc.)? (65 % of family respondents strongly agree or agree.)  "Parents/guardians are invited to visit classrooms to  observe instruction." (85% of family respondents strongly agree or agree.)

Further still, professional development is offered  to support their analysis and use of data to inform instructional decisions.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)   Column B   Section Reference(s)  5A-E     5A-E     5A-E        5A-E      Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds.

IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 09X163, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       Arthur Schomburg Elementary School - P.S. 163 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary Education (ESSA) Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  ELL early literacy assessments includes NYSITELL / Spanish LAB performance, Fountas and Pinnell (English for all K-5 students  and Spanish for K-4 TBE students), and the NYS ELA (3-5), NYS Math (3-5) and NYS Science  (4th) provide additional data points.     When analyzing school testing performance, the F&P reading levels were not reflected in the students’ NYS ELA scores.  For  example, while many ELL students on grades 3-5 scored a Level 2, 3, or 4 on the Spring F&P assessment, ELA results showed  that only a small percentage of our ELLs were Level 2 with just a few ELLs scored at Level 3 or 4 on the ELA.  In previous years,  item analysis has indicated that our ELLs are significantly weaker in Writing than in Reading.  The item analysis from the ELA  indicates that ELLs continue to struggle in both the Reading and Writing from Sources domains, and that in fact more students  were below city average in Reading than in Writing from Sources.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The Instructional Leadership Team with data collated by the Assessment Coordinator analyzes and prepares Class Summary  Data to be shared schoolwide.  Together with school leaders teachers develop action plans  to be implemented with bilingual  and ENL classrooms.    For example, amending the school's curriculum map, revising and amending the school's writing rubrics,  revising school's instructional focus.  The implementation of the action plan is monitored closely by the Instructional  Leadership Team periodically through assessments, classroom observations, learning walks and analysis of student work.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  There are many different metrics for evaluating the success of our programs.  Chief among them is the correlation between  those students taking the NYSESLAT who also took the ELA and Math state exams.  A review of the data demonstrates that we  have a large number of students at the Expanding level of proficiency across all grade levels yet based on the spring 2016  data  27 students demonstrated growth of 1, 2 or 3 levels of proficiency while 45 remained at the same proficiency level and  another 27 regressed at least 1 proficiency level.  This demonstrates that we must do a better at moving students from one  proficiency level to the next. Since writing has historically been our weakness we are currently working at improving our  outcomes addressing NYSESLAT preparation through Test Sophistication strategies and a renewed focus on correlating our  writing rubrics to the NYSESLAT rubric.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Our Instructional Leadership Team in collaboration with teacher teams reviewed test data and desegregated the ELL data.  In  doing so teachers are able to make determinations about how their students are performing compared to their non-ELL  peers.  Teacher teams use data to refine our curriculum maps and ensure instructional strategies and interventions are  appropriate to meet the needs of our ELL population.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   There are many data points which are used to guide instruction for the ELLs within RTI.  Under RTI, we track multiple data  points over and extended period of time.  Fountas and Pinnell assessment data is very important to this process.  In Reading  Workshop, teachers use this data for the entire class to group students according to their reading level and assessed  needs.  This acts as a screening for all students.  The strengths and needs identified through the assessment of each student  enable teachers to improve and adjust instruction.  In this way, it becomes clear if students are responding to in-class  interventions.  ESL classrooms have an additional resource in the form of the team teaching relationship between the general  education teacher and the ESL teacher.  The ESL teacher is able to analyze the data from a different lens and help the general  education teacher adjust their instruction to meet the needs of their ELLs.  The ESL teacher makes sure that the intervention is  appropriate, and when students are not succeeding despite intervention, the ESL teacher, in conjunction with the general  education teacher, can determine whether to continue to try additional interventions or to submit an RTI Referral Form to the  administration to convene the RTI Committee to look at the student’s case.  The bilingual classes also have an additional  resource when looking at data; the data for the Fountas and Pinnell in the native language of Spanish, can be examined as  well, and compared to progress on the F&P English.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   With the redesign of the NYSESLAT, the speaking section is now much more challenging.  The rubrics now award fewer points  to grammatically incorrect but intelligible answers, and the new Response to Graphic Information was rigorous.    According to  the data  a great number of our students are now at the Expanding and Commanding levels as measured by the revised  NYSESLAT.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Upon release of the spring 2017 NYSESLAT data the Instructional Leadership Team will review and analyze the data and  disseminate initial findings to staff during Grade Level Meetings.  In Teacher Teams our teachers will engage in  further analysis and the development of an action plan that will address the needs of the identified ELLs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   We have a self-contained ESL class on each grade Kindergarten through grade 5.  In Kindergarten, 1st,  2  nd   and  5th   grade, the classroom teachers (Ms. DaSilva, Ms. Weisblum, Ms. Awani, and Ms. Roman, 5) are dually certified  (ESL certified and Common Branches).   These teachers provide ENL instruction as well as Integrated Instruction in ENL  in Literacy (Reading and Writing,) Math, Science and Social Studies.  While in grades 3 & 4 we have two teachers in  each classroom. One is Childhood Education certified while the other is ESL certified.    The pairs of Common Branch  teachers and certified ESL teachers use common planning times, schedule additional times to communicate/plan, and  utilize e-mail to share content and curriculum language objectives to ensure effective ENL planning, delivery of grade- level Common Core curriculum, and delivery of language-level instruction by the ESL push-in teacher in small groups  (tactile and interactive methods are used for engagement and learning experiences).  Together with the Common  Branch teacher they provide Integrated ENL in Math, Science and Social Studies.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     We have a TBE (Spanish)  class on K-3 in  every grade.  There is also a 4-5 bridge Spanish TBE class.   The classes are  heterogeneous groups with learners at all 4 proficiency levels.  Teachers meet with students in small groups  throughout the day for differentiated instruction.  Bilingual teachers teach Literacy (Reading and Writing) in the Home  Langauge (Spanish_ a minimum of 3X per week.  They also teach as Social Studies in the Home Langauge  (Spanish).  Math is taught in English.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not Applicable        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   The school follows the revised Part 154 guidelines to ensure that ENL, ELA and HLT are provided to each student based on  their assessed proficiency level.   For Entering and Emerging students we provide 180 minutes of ENL and 180 minutes of  Integrated ENL/through the content areas of Literacy (Reading and Writing,)  Math and Social Studies.  For Transitioning and  Expanding students we provided 90 minutes of ENL and 90 minutes of Integrated ENL/through the content areas of Math and  Social Studies.   F-ELLs and students that have tested at the Commanding level are provided 90 minutes of ENL and 90 minutes  of Integrated ENL/through the content areas of Literacy, Math and Science.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Reading Workshop – The reading mini-lesson is a teacher-developed curriculum with the Common Core Exemplar Texts at the  heart, in Spanish for TBE and English for ESL.  The mini-lesson follows the Workshop Model format.  Teachers can make the  text more accessible by activating prior knowledge as appropriate, building background knowledge, incorporating explicit  noticing of vocabulary, including a language objective in their lessons, using concrete visual supports, creating adapted text   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      versions, and exposing students to other versions of the text (graphic novel/movie clip/reader’s theatre/etc.).  SMART Boards,  document cameras, and laptops can be used to display and annotate text, as well as show visuals related to the text.  Teachers  can ensure that students are making use of these supports by incorporating frequent pair, small group, and class discussion, in  line with Danielson 3b.  As appropriate, ESL teachers can also make use of native language supports (see Item #15), particularly  in the 5th grade ESL class where there are more newcomers.  Guided Reading instruction is also a critical part of Reading  Workshop.  Teachers meet with two different reading groups every day.  Groupings are determined by the F&P assessments  administered three times a year, and modified according to teacher observation and informal assessment.  Writing is also an  important part of Reading Workshop as evidence of their reading and comprehending of text.  Students must submit 30 book  responses (book reports) over the course of the school year.  Every day, Reading is a special 60 minute block to ensure that  students have plenty of time to read independently and teachers have adequate time to meet with two groups.     Writing Workshop – PS 163 is returning to Lucy Calkins for Writing curriculum this year.  The current edition is Common Core  aligned and has a greater emphasis on nonfiction.  Teachers can use many of the same strategies they did for Reading, though  it should be noted that it the modeling done by the teacher in Writing is especially critical.  Students work independently  subsequent to the minilesson.  The teacher confers with students about their writing.  The TBE classes cover the same  material, but instruction is in Spanish.          Math – Math is taught in English in all classes.  In response to a plunge in math scores the past two years, math is a 90 minute  block every day for all grades.  We have adopted Go Math as our curriculum.  Go Math is aligned to the Common Core, unlike  our old Everyday Math-based curriculum.  ELL students will benefit from instruction that includes extensive modeling, work  with manipulatives, explicit noticing and use of vocabulary, frequent oral language activities, visual supports, activation of  prior knowledge, and visual supports.   The kits come with manipulatives which are incorporated into instruction.  The website  for Go Math offers animated models illustrating many of the concepts, providing visual supports.  All units also have a video  that goes along with it that talks about the concepts in real life, activating prior knowledge and building background with visual  supports.  There are also premade SMART Board versions of each lesson, offering students an additional opportunity for  student volunteers to engage in kinesthetic/tactile activities.  Every unit has a preassessment called Show What You Know,  which helps teachers to create groupings for the unit and assigns each student to an RTI Tier for further support.  There are  additional materials to support small group instruction for Tier II and Tier III for each specific lesson.  This is great for SIFE  students in particular who may come in without many prerequisite skills; these resources ensure that instruction being given  to small groups still relates to the concepts of the unit, but are appropriate to the needs of students needing low-level work.     Science and Social Studies - Science is taught to all classes in English.  Social Studies is in Spanish to the TBE classes.  The NYC  Scope and Sequence is used to plan, prepare, and deliver Science and Social Studies instruction. The cluster teachers at PS 163  teach Science in English to most classes K-5.  Science teachers are meeting bi-monthly to discuss highly effective teaching  strategies that will address our students needs and learning modalities. Meetings discuss the use of hands-on experiences,  exploration, interactive technology, use of vocabulary in context, an accessible Science word wall in every classroom, visual  supports next to the Science vocabulary, use of scaffolding and differentiation, and the use of Scientific expressive language in  the areas of listening, speaking, reading, and writing.   Social Studies is taught in Spanish in the Spanish TBE classes.  It is taught  in English in the ESL classes.  Teachers utilize many of the strategies already outline for other subject areas to teach Social  Studies.               4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Students in the Grade 3-5 TBE clases are evaluated with el Exam de Lectura en Espanol each spring.  As part of the interim  assessment at the school level TBE teachers also evaluate student indpendent reading levels in Spanish using the F & P in  Spanish.  Additionally, screening and progress monitoring is conducted the bilingual and ESL providers during weekly 1:1 and  small group  conferencing sessions      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a      There are only 5 SIFE student at our school. The classroom teacher works 1:1 them 1:1 or in small groups daily to ensure  that their needs are being met. Additionally, the ESL teacher assigns him to work the Imagine Learning Digital Program to help  him acquire English.    b.     Language instructional approaches and methods to make content comprehensible to enrich language development for  students who have been in the NYC Public School System for 0-3 years include: total physical response, concrete visual  supports and repetition (including repeated experiences), making the most of the student's "Silent Period" (whereby visual  and audio delivery is maximized as students absorb and internally process, ponder, and contemplate what they are seeing and  hearing), connecting visuals with writing, multiple exposure to small group instruction/work, scaffolding, differentiation, use of  cognates, role play, creating authentic speaking experiences, class buddy system (for learning, discussing, and writing), explicit  instruction, explicit modeling, think alouds, use of literacy website supports (e.g. Starfall, Raz Kids), small groups for reteaching  of concepts, language and content objectives/prompts, and the use of leveled text with picture support. Teachers will  conference with students and use student data and observations to tailor instruction.  c.     Students with 4 to 6 years of service will still benefit from many of the strategies outlined for students with three years or  less, as long as it is developmentally appropriate.  Students will also benefit from hands-on activities and project-based  learning.  At PS 163, most students with 4 to 6 years of service are invited to After School, and to the After School program as  well.  For more information on these programs, see Item #13.     d.     There are currenly no longer term ELLs at our school.  e.     We are offering former ELLs targeted support by inviting them to the Saturday ELL Arts Program.  Additionally, FELLs are  placed with ELL counterparts in self-contained ESL classrooms where they continue to receive the language support they need.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   At our school we utilize a variey of strategies an support materials to reach our ELLs including Imagine Learning.  Imagine  learning is a langauge and literacy program that features interactive activites, videos and games to provide differentiated  instruction.  The program also provides strategic first lanugage support in 15 languages sto faciliate and enahnce ELL  learning.  As the students become more proficeint in English, the langauge support graduatly reduces.  Imagine Learning  focuses on language development including building basic vocabulary, academic language, grammar and listening  comprehension.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Additionally, our school uses ST Math an instructional software is designed to help all students reach math proficiency through  self-paced, language-independent, mastery-based objectives. It is closely aligned to state and Common Core State Standards  for Mathematics and integrates with core instruction. ST Math games use interactive, graphically-rich animations that visually  represent mathematical concepts to improve conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Saturday ELLA Academy – Grades 2-5, Transitioning and Expanding and ELLs – Instruction in English.   This program is sponsored by the Office of English Language Learners in partnership with The Center for Arts Education.  It  offers an English Language and Literacy through the Arts program (ELLA) to further English language and literacy learning for  selected students at PS 163 .   The program provides challenging experiences in music, dance, theater, and visual arts.  Classroom teachers are paired with teaching artists and will collaborate in the planning and delivery of instruction. The daily  instructional schedule will include two 90 minute sessions: ESL/Literacy through the Arts Residency and ESL/Literacy session.  Both sessions will be implemented under the leadership of the classroom teacher.       SETSS – Students with SETSS on their IEP work with Ms. Cocolicchio, a certified Special Education teacher.  Math and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      ELA.  Instruction is in English, though Ms. Cocolicchio also speaks Spanish.      Academic Intervention/RTI – Ms. Cocolicchio.  Students identified at Risk by the RTI are provided with intervention is reading  and mathematics.      Differentiated Intervention in Science and Social Studies are provided by the classroom teacher using the Harcourt Program.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Continue offering ELLA program to students in grades 2-5 that combines language literacy with arts instruction.  Children have  the opportunity to expand their knowledge of language and content while focusing on the different genres of the arts.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.  ESL, TBE, and 12:1:1 classes have access to the same cluster classes  (Science, ST Math, PE, Music, Art) as the other classes.  ELLs are also invited to the same additional programs that non-ELLs  have access to, such as After School .  In fact, our ELLs are identified at a higher rate for these programs than non-ELLs, and  ELLs have access to special programs such as the Saturday ELLA Program, which is popular with students and not open to non- ELLs (save Former ELLs who recently tested out).       The After School Program provides academic support to at-risk students.  Students were primarily identified by F&P reading  level.  Most ELLs are eligible for the program and have been invited to participate.  Certified ESL teachers Ms. DaSilva and Ms.  Osorio, as well as certified bilingual teacher Ms. Bodden, are among the six pedagogues teaching.       The Saturday ELL Arts (ELLA) program is in its fourth year at PS 163.  This program is sponsored by the NYC DOE Office of  English Language Learners.  This exciting program pairs a teacher with a visiting teaching artist.  In previous years, teaching  artists included an actress, a dancer, and a visual artist.  There were also special performances by a Flamenco troupe and a  professional mime.          12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  All ELL students have the same access to learning as do non-ELL students. Each ESL/TBE class uses SMART Boards, document  cameras listening centers, and laptops, as well as access to digital recorders, digital cameras, poster makers, and color copies  for visual support.        The new Go Math curriculum provides pre-made SMART Board files for every lesson, along with videos, animations, and online  interactive toolkits at the ThinkCentral, the Go Math website.   Teachers, as well as coaches and administrators, are sharing  this information with teachers on the other grades.     For math, PS 163 is also using Spatial-Temporal Math (ST Math) from MIND Research Institute on Grades 3-5 through a  grant.  Classes visit the computer lab twice a week to use the website, which uses interactive games and animated characters  to help improve students’ understanding of key math concepts and better problem-solving skills.  ESL and TBE classes  participate in the program just like their peers.  One of the unique features of the program it its reliance on symbolic  representation – letters and words are hardly every used – which makes it accessible to all ELLs.         ESL and TBE classrooms use several sites to support literacy.  All K-3 classrooms have access to Award Reading Online, an  online site that contains audio versions of the Award Reading guided reading books, as well as activities for all of the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      books.  ESL/TBE classrooms frequently make use of the website Starfall to introduce the alphabet and letter sounds to  students.  Raz-Kids is used by ESL/TBE classrooms on grades 3-5.  Raz-Kids gives students access to dozens of texts on their  level, and has audio for all books; a great support for ELLs who do not have anyone at home who can read to them in  English.  Students can also take quizzes on the books they have read, and progress is easy for teachers to track.  The website  recently was updated to add a Spanish section.      For Science and Social Studies, teachers have access to Discovery Education Streaming, which offers videos that can be used to  supplement instruction.  These videos can also be used to build background for topics being covered in other subjects.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Typically ELLs are divided into small groups throughout the subject areas so that ESL and TBE teachers are able to differentiate,  support, infuse ESL strategies, and provide real-world connections and activities using small group instruction throughout ELA,  NLA, math, and social studies. TBE teachers provide NLA in Spanish to strengthen and support the development of the Spanish  language throughout the four domains and have Spanish leveled text available to support Spanish instruction.     In the ESL classes, the teacher typically does not address the whole class in a language other than English.  Oral native language  support is delivered in a targeted one-to-one basis in the ESL classes.  The use of romance language cognates and Native  Language Support is made available in ESL classes in order to provide clarity of vocabulary and concepts.    On K-4, Spanish- speaking parents of newcomer students typically opt to put their child in TBE, reducing the need for first language support in  the lower grade self-contained ESL classes.  Teachers may make translated materials and dictionaries available as  needed.    Bilingual glossaries produced by NYSED for Social Studies, Math, and Science are made available for support on 3-5  and to accustom the students to these resources prior to the state test.  A small selection of books in the first language may  also be included in the class library, particularly in the upper grades.      In the instance where a language other than Spanish is needed for clarity, the children who understand that particular  language are able to assist by providing peer support within the small group. The ESL teacher is able to check for  understanding, adjust the lesson as needed, and proceed with the lesson while making observation notes. ESL teachers  frequently speak with each other, share best practices, and go to other staff members/parents who may be able to assist with  native language (other than English and Spanish) vocabulary support (e.g. French, Twi, Creole).      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The academic instruction offered to ELLs in the After School program is determined by a review of the data.  We consider  English language proficiency levels as well as performance in Reading and Writing.  Entering and Emerging ELLs are invited to a  program that focuses on language development using Imagine Learning. While students who at Transitioning, Expanding and  Commanding levels are part of the Writing Academcy.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    All ELL students have the same access to learning as do non-ELL students. Each ESL/TBE class uses SMART Boards, document  cameras listening centers, and laptops, as well as access to digital recorders, digital cameras, poster makers, and color copies  for visual support.        The new Go Math curriculum provides premade SMART Board files for every lesson, along with videos, animations, and online  interactive toolkits at the ThinkCentral, the Go Math website.

Students can also take quizzes on the books they have read, and progress is easy for teachers to track.  The website  recently was updated to add a Spanish section.      For Science and Social Studies, teachers have access to Discovery Education Streaming, which offers videos that can be used to  supplement instruction.  These videos can also be used to build background for topics being covered in other subjects.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   All incoming Kindergarteners receive a Welcome Packet that outlines "What to Expect" as students and their families prepare  for Kindergarten. The Welcome Packet also identifies activities students and families can do to prepare for a smooth transition  in September. We also work in collaboration with Head Start to provide a school tour during the month of June so that our  incoming Head Start children have the opportunity to walk through the school, meet teachers, and ask questions.  New  students that come during the school year are typically assigned a buddy, ideally of the same language background, who can  help them navigate the classroom and the school.  Many teachers set up meetings with parents of new admits soon after the  student arrives in order to get to know the student and parent better and be able to offer assistance.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Not Applicable.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable.        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  At PS 163, every grade meets once a week during a common prep for professional development.  Typically, the session is  facilitated by one of the Instructional  Leads  in attendance are all of the grade level teachers, including the ESL teacher  assigned to the grade.  This gives us a chance to examine student work and related rubrics, share effective teaching practices,  and review data.       There are numerous opportunities for professional development outside as well.  Last year, ESL and Bilingual teachers  attended PD sessions offered by the NYC Office of English Language Learners with Tony Stead on Reading and Writing  Nonfiction for ELLs under Common Core.  Teachers all enjoyed this PD.  ELL teachers also attended a series of workshops by Dr.  Ivana Soto on Oral Language Development & Shadowing, hosted by the Fordham Regional Bilingual and ESL Resource Network  (RBE-RN).  Teachers have also attended sessions on RTI for ELLs last year and this year.  Four ELL teachers attended the NYSABE  annual conference on Long Island last Spring.  The school secretary, Wendy Pimentel, maintains PD records that identify the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      respective teachers, dates, times, locations, and the titles of each PD session attended.     Our PD Calendar for the 2015-2016 includes 3 cycles:  September-November: General Response Protocol, School Safety,  STARs Classroom, the RTI Process, Child Abuse Report and  Prevention, Chancellor's Regulations, Respect for All, Conflict of Interests, Health and EPI-Pen Training, NYS Testing Program  etc.  During Cycle II (December-May all staff are invited to select 2 professional development opportunties and study groups  focused on improving Questioning and Discusion and Differentiation of Instruction and Assessment.  The final Cycle  (June)  offers staff the opportunities to review data and assist with program planning for the coming school year.       In addition, the school is committed to participating in Professional Opportunity Offerings available throught Fordham  University's RBERN Office for example:  "Writing Effective Language Objectives for ELLs of All Proficiency Levels ," District 9's  Teacher Rounds Initiative, the New Teacher Center, as well as multiple offerings of the Bronx Field Support Center.   Some of  the Offerings from the Bronx Field Office include: Fresh Off the Press!  Navigating and Implementing the NYCDOE’s Enhanced  Science Scope and Sequence, “Said is Dead”: Effective Vocabulary Instruction that Works, The Acquisition and Development of  Academic Language through Mathematics:  Meeting the Needs of All Learners, Including ELLs, Problem Solved!  Rich Math  Tasks that Promote High Levels of Student Thinking, Individual and Cultural Identity: Exploring Culture and Community in the  Primary Grades, andChatty Cathy Makes a Comeback: Why Students Must Engage in Academic Conversations and How to Do  It!        At our school, we are working in conjunction with Aileen Colon of the Fordham to develop the 3rd grade ESL and Bilingual  classrooms as Lab Sites for other ELL teachers to visit.  Recently, Ms. Colon conducted two demo lessons on the Picture-Word  Inductive Model for the Lab Site teachers.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As our ELL students get ready to transition from elementary to middle school, our guidance counselor (Melissa Ortiz), parent  coordinator (Betty Stewart), fifth grade teachers, Assistant Principal (Karen Bolles) and Principal (Dilsia Martinez) communicate  regularly via workshops, school/family activities, and parent letters to inform families about middle school options, varied  specialty schools, as well as the enrollment process. Home communication pertaining to middle school is sent out to parents  throughout the year as the students visit schools, make choices, and finally transition from the elementary setting to middle  school. In the event that assistance is needed to complete forms, the guidance counselor, a native Spanish speaker, is also on  hand to assist ESL and bilingual families.     4.  Currently under development: Training for new teachers will cover a range of high impact teaching strategies that can be  useful in any elementary school classroom, but are particularly useful when working with ELL students.  Several sessions also  familiarize teachers with technology available for instruction in the school.  1. SMART Board I – Basic Usage – Writing and Navigation  2.

How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents of ELL students enjoy being asked to participate in school activities and celebrations.  As a school receiving Focus  funds, PS 163 has increased the number of activities relating to academic readiness.  For instance, this past September, we  hosted Family Fall Fun Fest on a Saturday.  Parents participated in workshops facilitated by teachers to learn about how to help  their children succeed in reading and math.  Teachers were paired together for these workshops so that in every group, there  was at least one staff member who could present in Spanish so that we could reach as many parents as possible.  Ms. Betty  Stewart, the Parent Coordinator, secured the participation of eleven community organizations to present workshops and staff  information booths.  Ms. Betty always makes sure to arrange that visiting organizations have at least one staff member who is  conversant in Spanish.  The event concluded with a barbeque hosted by Principal Martinez, who always makes sure to address  parents in both Spanish and English.  In addition to this event, there are a series of nutritional workshops offered with a  bilingual presenter, and workshops at the Tremont Branch of the NYPL.Last school year, the PTA sent a dozen parents to the  NYSABE conference out on Long Island.  About five members, along with Ms. Betty, attended the citywide Annual ELL Parent  Conference at the Javits Center.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Response #2 (No field available above)  Parents are informed of Orientation Meetings via a flyer that is provided to each parent during enrollment.   At the Orientation  Meetings parents are provided with a clear description of each program model and view the DOE's video.  Each parent is  provided a copy of the Parent Survey and Program Selection Form where they can indicate thir program choice.  Most parents  complete the form on-site following the meeting.  But if a parents wants to think about it further they are advised that the  form must be returned to the school within 5 days.  The schoool maintains all records and forms related to ELL Program  selection including letters, flyers, anecdotal records confirming phone calls etc. in the main office file.     Response #3  One of our bilingual teachers is also certified as a Social Worker, Ms. Acosta. She has developed a Parent Support Group and  network to provide the parents of ELLs and new immigrants opportunities to mutually support one another while learning  about resources, strategies and organizations to improve their parenting practices.     The Parent Coordinator supports the efforts of Ms. Acosta by seeking persons within the community who are willing to provide  interpretation services in community langugaes such as Sonieke.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dilsia Martinez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Arthur A.
