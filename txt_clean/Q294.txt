This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview            BELL Academy is a unique learning environment that offers each student an opportunity to find and develop his or her  unique profile of gifts and talents. Based on the School-wide Enrichment Model (SEM), developed by Drs. Joseph  Renzulli and Sally Reiss at the University of Connecticut, the major goal of the school is to provide challenging, in-  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      depth, real-world learning experiences for all students. Our collaborative school culture focuses on the development  of talents in all students and provides a broad range of advanced-level enrichment. Instructional technology  integrated through all subject areas will ensure students develop the necessary skills to be prepared for the demands  of the 21st century. The school culture celebrates individuality, creativity, and diversity to develop creative problem  solvers who are successful and believe they can make a difference in the world. As a community of learners, BELL  Academy is committed to inspiring a passion for learning and civic responsibility, one student at a time.                     2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    As a school modeled on the Schoolwide Enrichment Model of Dr. Joseph Renzulli and Dr. Sally Reis, BELL Academy  works to develop educational challenges for students of all ability levels. Staff works to combine student talents and  interests with a rigorous Common Core aligned curriculum to help prepare students for high school, college, and/or  their career. To enhance our knowledge of students, we have all students take interest surveys that we use to help  inform decisions in the classroom and as part of our Schoolwide Enrichment Model.   Our Instructional Focus for the 2018-2019 School Year is: Students will engage in high-quality interactive discussions  based upon deeper insightful analysis of relevant and concise text-based details and exemplified by responses to  peers’ questioning and extensions of peers’ thoughts, thereby improving standards-based performance in evidence- based student writing and oral responses in all content areas.   We also look to enhance the education provided for the individual students of BELL Academy through the application  of our Academic Goal: We will continue to advance student and teacher learning through the consistent application of  strategy-based feedback and actionable next steps, including peer and self-assessment of common core aligned tasks  and rubrics.   This supports our school’s commitment to Danielson’s component 3B: Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques  as a way to improve student learning. Additionally, we have selected to focus on using the discussions held in class to  improve the written work products of our students. Staff members continue to lead professional development on  using the Hochman Writing Method to improve student writing. BELL has also focused closely on the integration of  STEM throughout different subject areas. Our grade level and core inquiry teams have used a STEM rubric to evaluate  teacher lesson and their impact on student learning.    Historically, BELL Academy has had high student performance, and continue to apply our efforts to improving student  progress. Over the past five years, we have implemented Expeditionary Learning as our ELA curriculum and CMP3 and  are broadening our use of the Algebra for All for our math curriculum. During this process, teacher teams worked  collaboratively to modify the modules and design tasks within these programs to help meet the needs of our diverse  learners. We have also worked to update our curriculum maps and create an online library of unit plans and the  enhancements that are made to these plans over the course of the year. We have emphasized the areas that will  specifically target multiple entry points for learners of all ability levels including students with disabilities, English  language learners, and former English language learners.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      This school has a strong Schoolwide Enrichment Model, consisting of project-based learning within all content areas,  as well as Enrichment Clusters, which meets for two periods every Friday. This time period allows students to  investigate their interests and talents more directly for this time period.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     When our school collaborated to develop our instructional focus, we emphasized the importance of student  discussion with regards to creating deeper knowledge within the learning process. Over the past few years, we have  worked to increase the discussion around topics studied as well as increasing the relevance for tasks in all subjects,  but especially math tasks. Our school has recently increased the number of students taking the Algebra Regents,  especially among students with disabilities. We want to continue to monitor student success on this exam as well as  offer this exam to all students prepared for this exam.   In our most recent Quality Review, the importance of providing actionable next steps was emphasized to help  improve individual student growth. We feel that implementing stronger questioning techniques will help students  analyze topics in greater depth and foster greater independence of learning. We also plan to continue inquiry cycles  related to the rigor and relevance of tasks both on a grade and departmental level, which was begun last year on a  grade level primarily.   Ensuring students are engaged in rigorous learning tasks is an ongoing focus that drives much of our professional  learning. By placing a strong emphasis on the problem-based nature of S.T.E.A.M. learning, teachers have been  frequently making enhancements to their unit plans and tasks. We also look to evaluate the impact increasing the  percentage of our eighth grade students taking the Algebra Regents and have been incorporating Algebra for All in the  student class sessions has had on instruction and overall student performance.           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Our scores in both of these aspects of Supportive  Environment fell slightly below the city average for these categories. While we do many positive things to create a  supportive environment, we will focus more strategically in order to cater our school programs including, weekly  advisory and assembly periods to better meet student needs and promote awareness of teen and pre-teen issues.  During the 2015-2016 school year, we began partnerships with “Beautiful Me” and the Anti-Defamation League that  we will seek to continue and enhance as a facet of our supportive environment for the current school year.       We also seek to expand our work with social emotional training through Yale University, including further  development of our school-wide Social Emotional Charter. We will also be working to continue our use of ClassDojo to  monitor student behaviors as well as develop a Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports system for our school.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.      In developing this goal, we have consulted many different sources of information including formative and summative  data. This goal has been developed to help us to plan for curricula and unit plans that challenge learners of all ability  levels. We also believe that through targeted unit plans and tasks with stronger alignment to standards, student  progress data will continue to improve. Through the continued refinement of the curriculum units teachers create, we  expect to improve engagement and performance. Teachers will also be challenged to implement tasks that relate to  S.T.E.M. concepts in all subject areas to help increase engagement and improve twenty-first century skills. Tasks will  be designed to utilize technology to enhance thinking rather than simply replace pen and paper tasks.   While recent State Assessment data shows 66% of students receiving a level 3 or 4 on the ELA test and 71% in math,  our growth percentiles indicate a need to continue to focus on individual student progress. This is further exemplified  by feedback from our most recent Quality Review, which indicates a need to place a greater emphasis on clear and  actionable next steps to improve individual student learning outcomes. The effectiveness of our feedback and its  impact on student results will be a focus for our supervisory inquiry as well as for our teacher teams. While BELL  Academy has used the inquiry cycle to evaluate the impact of high quality, timely feedback, the positive results we  have observed call for further refinement and consistent delivery of our feedback. Teacher teams will also work  collaboratively to plan tasks within unit plans that contain multiple entry points that will prove a challenging learning  experience for all students.   BELL Academy staff members have also continued their focus on leveraging technology as a means for assessment, as  well as to help provide the timely and actionable feedback that helps drive student learning. We will continue this  process as part of the Learning Partners Program for this school year.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

BELL Academy has included opportunities for parent voice, parent participation, and a calendar of professional  workshops geared to involve parents in the educational program. Our most recent School Survey data indicated a  need to improve Strong Family and Community Ties. Our school survey results indicate a need to involve parents  more actively as volunteers as well as to have communication systems in place to increase parent awareness of their  child's progress. While BELL Academy has shown improvement on survey results, this continues to be an area of focus  regarding connections between our school and the community. We continue to seek ways to involve parents in the  educational program and maintain open lines of communication. Last year we experienced success with Class Dojo,  and we will continue to use Jupiter Ed to maximize parental communication.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50     State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. BELL Academy, in compliance with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of  student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed  by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are  encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee  as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      BELL Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under ESSA.   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  In order to assess the literacy skills of our students we look at the data from the English Language Arts baseline as well as the  item analysis from the English Language Arts state exam.  The results of this assessment are used to plan and guide instruction  for both the ENL and content area teachers. This data is shared during team planning so that it can be used to foster discussion  among the teachers and create action plans for academic success.                        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   BELL staff meet weekly during grade level inquiry and core inquiry team with data analysis to discuss students' formative  assessment or curriculum-embedded assessment results. During grade level inquiry,  the ENL teacher and classroom teachers  sit together and analyze ELL students' formative assessments regarding each content are and language acquisition. In addition,  the ENL teacher and classroom teachers collaborate virtually via Google Classroom.  ELL students' works are shared with the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         ENL teacher, and the ENL teacher can give feedback to their students through this process. The ENL teacher also meets with  the classroom teacher regularly to discuss the performance of the students and review their portfolio.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  At BELL Academy the success of our program for ELLs is evaluated each year by the academic performance of our  students.  Some of the data sources that are analyzed include but are not limited to: NYSESLAT scores, ELA scores, Math  scores, and ELL Periodic Assessment scores.  The results of these assessments show that our students are benefiting from  instruction in both push-in and pull-out classes.                           4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The classroom teacher, ENL teacher, and special education team meet regularly to discuss interventions at grade level inquiry  and core inquiry team with data analysis. THe ENL teacher and classroom teachers collaborate to design scaffolding for  struggling ENL students. During regular class periods, the ENL teacher and special education teacher provide support to  struggling students.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Paste response to question here:   Within the RTI framework, teachers uses data daily to guide their planning and instruction.  During the Universal Screening stage, screening assessments allows teachers to identify weaknesses through benchmarks and  criteria. During the Strong Core Instruction Stage, data is used to help students create meaningful conversations, use complex  thinking, and develop literacy. Data is used to create intensive, targeted instruction. last, we monitor progress through data.          6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The majority of our students at BELL Academy tested advanced or Expanding, on the NYSESLAT.   If there is a beginner, this  tells us that our students in the zero to three years of service subgroup are progressing and our students that have had four  years of service or more  need to be closely monitored so that we can work to move them in the direction of proficiency.   ENL  teacher will also look at the number of ELL students and their history.  These students have shown progress and we will  continue to monitor them so their progress continues throughout the year.   One of our Expanding  students is a long-term  ELL-SWD.  This student has not been previously x-coded and is therefore not eligible for ELAND review the ENL teacher works  closely with the self-contained special education teacher and our IEP team to ensure that this student is meeting her IEP goals  and making academic progress.                                 7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   he ENL teacher special education team, and other supporting staff works collaboratively to plan the program ensuring each  student gets help based on their individual needs. The ENL teacher also refers to the IEP plans of students to make  accommodations in the ENL program. For long term ELL students, the ENL teacher and classroom teachers have analyzed their  areas of need and designed a proper path of instruction for these students. The ENL teacher also provides extra help during  lunchtime to help students with their classwork.         Part IV: ELL Programming     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our instructional program for our ELL students is a push in program serviced by 1 licensed ENL teacher. During the  push in periods, students travel to the room, and Ms.Sun pushes into for instruction. Our children receive the  mandated ENL-ELA allotted instructional time based on the students’ proficiency levels. The time allotment is based  on the regulations of the CR Part 154. The instruction is aligned with the NYS Common Core standards. The ENL  teacher has collaborated with classroom teachers about curriculum and students’ abilities, needs, and  accomplishments.  Entering and Emerging students receive 8 periods a week of instruction. Each containing 45  minutes. Transitioning and Expanding students receive 4 periods a week, each period also 45 minutes. The  Commanding students, the Former ELL's receive 2 periods  a week.  The  ELL’s are divided into 3 groups, 6, 7 and, 8.  The type of program BELL Academy uses is a Push In program. The ELL teachers’ program is designed to not pull  students while they are at lunch and at different times of the week. This is to ensure they are not missing the same  subject every day.  The program models are block, class travels together as a group and heterogeneous, mixed  proficiency levels.      The ENL program that is used at BELL Academy  is Integrated ENL. This program is used to build  English language skills through content area instruction. Ms.Sun co-teaches alongside the classroom teacher using  ENL strategies to deliver content area subject matter. The Integrated ENL program  is delivered through a Push-in and  Pull-Out Model. In the Push-In model Ms. Sun works with ELL's in collaboration with the classroom teachers to  provide language acquisition and vocabulary support. There is common preparation time between the 2 teachers to  plan and collaborate. The ELL's are also brought together from various classes for English acquisition -focused  instruction, the  Pull-Out Model. Ms. Sun continues to plan carefully with general education teachers to ensure  curricular alignment and continuity of instruction.There are four groups and they are grouped heterogeneously.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     NA   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      NA      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              There are 5 proficiency levels for ELL's based on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT. The beginner level, Entering, students  receive 360 minutes a week which is 8 periods. The low intermediate level, Emerging, students receive 360 minutes a week  which  8 periods. The intermediate level, Transitioning, students receive 180 minutes a week  which is 4 periods. The advanced  level, which is Expanding, students receive 180 minutes a week which is 4 periods. Last, the proficient level, Commanding,  these students receive 90 minutes a week , 2 periods, of integrated instruction time.                3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      During a Readers Workshop lesson, the ESL teacher provide students with small group instruction by following the Teachers  College workshop model. This supports learning in the four modalities in English as they learn new strategies during Readers  and Writers workshop.   During Writers workshop the ESL teacher provide students with small group instruction utilizing a model of instruction for  writing following the Teachers College writing process. They begin each session with a mini lesson and then conduct small  group strategy lessons to target their writing goals/needs based on their notebooks entries and published pieces. The ESL  teacher also incorporate shared writing and interactive writing during strategy lessons to enrich language development.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?        Native language support is present in our ESL program through the use of native language texts for cross-cultural  learning,  dictionaries/glossaries, visual aids, and partnerships between ELLs of the same language to support them  academically and socially as members of our school community. We ensure that ELL's are appropriately evaluated in their  native language by providing them translators during state tests or giving them the state test in their native language.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status      Our instructional Plan for SIFE students will incorporate intervention and emotional support from our guidance counselor.  These students will receive the mandated number of minutes per week of ESL instruction based on their proficiency level and  in accordance with the NYS CR Part 154. We will provide the students with supplementary reading intervention program based  on their reading needs during the day, wich will be in addition to their ESL services. They will be invited to attend extended day  program which is help for 50 minutes on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursdays after school. Programs that will be utilized are  Leap Frog, Mondo Pathways to Writing, and Moving into English. Based on data from numerous assessments, instruction is  differentiated.      The ELL's in our school that are here less than three years (new comers) receive the mandated number of minutes per week of  ESL instruction based on their proficiency level and in accordance with the NYS CR Part154. Emotional support is provided by  our guidance counselor to help them embrace the American culture during the month of September. They will receive  constant exposure to vocabulary and literacy instruction using a variety of manipulatives and pictures. The same programs  used for SIFE students will also be used for this sub group. In addition to those programs, Rosetta Stone is used to support  students.     Our 4-6 year ELL's receive the mandated number of minutes per week of ESL instruction based on their proficiency level in  accordance with the NYS CR Part 154. Within the mandated instructional time, these students receive small group instruction  in writing, which has been identifies as an area that needs improvement. Writing goals are created for this subgroup which  emphasize pre-writing,  creating paragraphs, topic sentences, sentence variety, and editing.      Long Term ELL's will receive the mandated number of minutes per week of ESL instruction based on their proficiency level and  in accordance with NYS CR Part 154.  We will provide these students with a supplementary intervention program to support  their reading and writing needs based on their levels. Supplementary intervention programs that will be utilized are Voyager,  Rygby On Our Way to English, Mondo Pathways to Writing, Empire State NYSESLAT , and Attanasio and Associates Getting  Ready for the NYSESLAT and Beyond.      Our plan for transitional support for students who reached proficiency on the NYSESLAT: The ESL teacher conferences with the  classroom teacher to monitor continued development.  These students are offered the opportunity to participate in ESL field  trips.   Former ELL's up to 2 years after testing out,  continue to be eligible for ELL testing accommodations and 90 minutes a  week of ENL, in addition to any accommodations  to their IEP's or 504 plans. By assessing each student, we can determine  which accommodations are most suitable and beneficial (will maximize the potential for achievement on all exams) for each  ELL at the beginning of the school year. Our ELL's are entitled to using those accommodations for most assessments, including  those that are teacher-made and State-mandated.  We do not use ELL accommodations on the NYSESLAT.  We provide testing accommodations to ELL  's as needed, on all NYS ELA and content area assessments (math, social studies, and science).       Accommodations for ELL's are: Time extension, separate location, third reading of listening selection on the ELA, word for   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      word bilingual dictionaries, oral translations for low incidence languages, writing responses in home languages, and  simultaneous use of English and alternative language editions.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    ELL's identified as having special needs receive the mandated number of minutes per week of ESL instruction based on their  proficiency level and in accordance with the NYS CR Part 154. The Pull Out ESL instruction model is preferred and is used to  support their academic needs in reading and writing to enhance the flow of learning within their usual class setting. Out of the  three students that have special disabilities, two are escorted with an alternate para when they are serviced by the ESL  teacher, Ms. Sun. The same programs that are utilized for Long Term ELL's are also used with addition to Interactive Smart  Board Lessons.  Some instructional strategies and grade level materials that the teacher of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic  content areas and speed English language development are:  -Seat students away from any distractions.  -Use a checklist to get students organized.  -Space short work periods with breaks.  -Provide written and verbal directions with visuals  -Provide incentives for beginning and completing material.  -Divide tests into small sections  - Role Play, model situations    -Share success between home and school  -Pick   a goal and focus on one for each activity.  -The Write Source, On Our Way to English, and Rigby In Step Readers are used to accelerate English language development.           7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The IEP, Speech, ESL, Physical Therapist, and classroom teacher collaborate to make sure there is flexibility in meeting the  diverse needs of ELL-SWD's within the least restrictive environment. While doing this we come up with the best strategies for  these students during our PPT meetings.  All of the service providers are present in the meetings:ESL, speech, IEP Teacher, PT,  and OT. During this meeting we ensure that all ELL's with disabilities are receiving services based on their IEP.  The members of  the PPT team along with classroom teachers compare their timetables on a regular basis to make sure there are no conflicts,  and all ELL's receive their mandated hours from each service provider.      All of the aforementioned materials and methods for other ELL groups are utilized for students with special needs with  additional scaffolding where necessary. Methods used are repeating and rephrasing, using graphic organizers and pictures, and  collaborative learning where students have the opportunity to use multiple intelligences and their particular learning styles.  Language learning games are supplemental motivational materials. Teachers allow extra "wait time" for students to process  information when answering questions. The ELL teacher uses hands on phonics, vocabulary and writing activities. ELL-SWD  interact with their peers during instructional time and extra curricular activities.     The ESL teacher along with the classroom teachers, have read and understood the IEP of the ESL special education student.  They have incorporated the necessary strategies in working with the students.  The PPT Team at BELL Academy  meet every  two weeks and uses the time to discuss how the ELL's are performing in their mandated services that are listed on their  IEP.             8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   The use of two languages is utilized during standardized testing as a test accommodation. Children are allowed to use a  bilingual dictionary. If necessary, ELL students have the test available in their native language as well. Also, to help prepare  struggling ELL's for the state tests. Explicit English as a Second Language (ESL) and ELA instruction is ongoing to meet the needs  of our beginners, intermediate, and advanced students. ELL students will be instructed using the Rigby On Our Way to English,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      Rigby In Step Readers, and The Write Source. These programs are designed for instruction in listening, speaking, reading, and  writing in English specifically for the ELL population. The program is aligned with grade curriculum and the lessons provide  differentiated instruction for every lesson. This program complies with the Common Core in ELL instruction. It teaches  language using manipulatives, flashcards, audio, and charts to help develop language and build transitions to comfort levels.          The point of entry model (POEM) provides a lens through which instruction is planned and implemented to ensure ELL  students’ engagement, productivity, assessments and real world connections. The school uses performance indicators set by  the state to drive instructional program. We have incorporated variety instructional strategies in accordance with ESL/ELA  standards that will allow ELL students to become proficient readers and writers. These strategies include, but are not limited  to, role-playing and components of a Balanced Literacy Program including shared reading and writing, interactive writing,  guided and independent reading and read alouds. We use graphic organizers and cooperative learning provides ELL students  with an opportunity to engage in accountable talk. Furthermore, ESL instruction utilizes pictures, games, Total Physical  Response (TPR), dramatization, text representations, and manipulatives, chants, songs, poems, and charts to help them  acquire language skills.      ELL students are given an opportunity to operate at all levels of the cognitive domain, striving to reach higher order thinking  skills such as: analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Phonics and vocabulary instruction are provided through various materials to  help build language acquisition. Class trips provide the ESL teacher with opportunities for discussion, language experience  approach and reinforcement of topics being taught in the classroom. Numeracy acquisition is developed through engaging in  hands on activities. ELL students have multiple opportunities to make connections in science and social studies through  literature.                9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       Further implementation of the Common Core State Standards, continued participation in grade meetings by the ELL teacher,  lesson planning using more questioning techniques provided by the Depth of Knowledge Levels, and  weekly planning sessions  are improvements for the upcoming school year.                        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No programs for ELL's will be discontinued this year.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.    BELL Academy implements the Renzulli Model for Schoolwide Enrichment for ALL students, including our ELL students. We  believe that opportunities to participate in enrichment activities should be provided to all students. We do this through  enrichment clusters, community service and various other enrichment activities. All ELL students participate in the activities  listed below.       All 6-8th grade students participate in enrichment clusters once a week for 90 minutes. Enrichment clusters are researched  based, flexible, have high standards and advanced levels of academic challenge for all students, employ multiple intelligences,  use a hands-on approach and culminate in a product of service. At BELL Academy we call our enrichment clusters  SEM.  Students choose a SEM based on their interest.  The following is a list of some of the SEM's offered at BELL are:  -Healthy Living  -Young Entrepreneurs  -Exploring Art Trough Social Studies  -The World of Fashion  -Planet Poetry  -Drama  -Stock Market Challenge  -Future Community Leaders  -Technology In Sports   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      -String Ensemble  -The World of Fashion   English Language Learners are encouraged to attend  After School, and Saturday programs. All communications are sent with  native language translations, and bilingual interpretations are used when necessary. ELL students attend regular classroom  sponsored field trips as well as ELL field trips.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   The following instructional materials are used to support ELLs at BELL Academy:  The ESL teacher uses Rigby's ESL Program: "On Our Way To English", which includes guided reading and shared reading  components to help students strengthen their reading and writing skills,. Students use NYSESLAT test prep materials so that  they can become familiar with and receive instruction in sample selections from the writing and reading selections of the  NYSESLAT. Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT AND BEYOND and Empire State NYSESLAT are the two books that are used.   -The Write Source: Writing Program  -In Step Readers: Guided reading Program  -Rosetta Stone computer software program. During independent time students are allowed to log onto their account to  practice all 4 Modalities of the English language.   •      Words Their Way- Big Book are used for shared reading, small books are used for guided reading.  Students are introduced  to both new vocabulary, and new conversational phrases.  This program introduces vocabulary and concepts in English.  It also  introduces phrases, and encourages the students to converse in English.  In addition there is an extensive index of all the  vocabulary used in the book.  •     Mondo – Pathways to Writing - This program assists English Language Learners in develop writing skills on different grade  levels.  There are fiction and non-fiction posters, as well as large graphic organizers.  These help the students develop writing  skills using different literary genres. The students learn to plan, compose, record, revise, edit, and publish their writing.    •     Literature and Leveled Libraries - The ESL classroom has a large collection of literature, organized according to reading  levels, themes, genres, and subject matter.  ELL students are encouraged to read and borrow books, according to their  interest, level, or particular subject being studied in their classrooms.    •     Bilingual Glossaries - These glossaries in various languages are used in all content areas, in the regular classroom, as well as  the ESL classroom. They are also used to prepare for specific citywide tests, such as the State Math Test, or the State Science  Test, as well as helping students perform on the actual test.  •     Leap Frog – An electronic reading program which reads aloud to students as they follow along, using a special pad, book,  and pointer. - This is an exciting format for the ELLs on all levels.       We do not offer a bilingual, dual language or 2-way program at this time; therefore, the only time ELL students are assessed  in two languages is when the English NYSITELL indicates that the student may be dominant in their native language. At that  time, the NYSITELL will be administered in the ELL student’s native language.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native Language Materials and Support: Bilingual dictionaries, glossaries, and bilingual and native language books are used to  support students' native language. In our ESL program, newcomer students are paired with bilingual students when necessary.  Cognates and cognate word walls are used to scaffold language learning. Pictures are used.     Native language support is given to student s by supplying them with bilingual books, in their native language  and English.  Also, during state tests, bilingual word for word glossaries are supplied to students. We also have staff in the building to  provide native language support in the following languages: Italian, Spanish, Hebrew, Hindi, Urdu, Greek, and Korean.           14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    ELL services and resources correspond with ELL's ages and grade levels. Grade level materials are utilized in the "Rigby on Our  Way to English" program as well as "The Write Source".  Other materials such as the games and pictures are age and grade  appropriate. ELL teachers use grade level pacing calendars and curriculum maps when planning and consult with classroom  teachers . They also refer to the Common Core State Standards when planning.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     The following instructional materials are used to support ELLs at BELL Academy:  The ESL teacher uses Rigby's ESL Program: "On Our Way To English", which includes guided reading and shared reading  components to help students strengthen their reading and writing skills,. Students use NYSESLAT test prep materials so that  they can become familiar with and receive instruction in sample selections from the writing and reading selections of the  NYSESLAT. Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT AND BEYOND and Empire State NYSESLAT are the two books that are used.   -The Write Source: Writing Program  -In Step Readers: Guided reading Program  -Rosetta Stone computer software program. During independent time students are allowed to log onto their account to  practice all 4 Modalities of the English language.   •      Words Their Way- Big Book are used for shared reading, small books are used for guided reading.  Students are introduced  to both new vocabulary, and new conversational phrases.  This program introduces vocabulary and concepts in English.  It also  introduces phrases, and encourages the students to converse in English.  In addition there is an extensive index of all the  vocabulary used in the book.  •     Mondo – Pathways to Writing - This program assists English Language Learners in develop writing skills on different grade  levels.  There are fiction and non-fiction posters, as well as large graphic organizers.  These help the students develop writing  skills using different literary genres. The students learn to plan, compose, record, revise, edit, and publish their writing.    •     Literature and Leveled Libraries - The ESL classroom has a large collection of literature, organized according to reading  levels, themes, genres, and subject matter.  ELL students are encouraged to read and borrow books, according to their  interest, level, or particular subject being studied in their classrooms.    •     Bilingual Glossaries - These glossaries in various languages are used in all content areas, in the regular classroom, as well as  the ESL classroom. They are also used to prepare for specific citywide tests, such as the State Math Test, or the State Science  Test, as well as helping students perform on the actual test.  •     Leap Frog – An electronic reading program which reads aloud to students as they follow along, using a special pad, book,  and pointer. - This is an exciting format for the ELLs on all levels.       We do not offer a bilingual, dual language or 2-way program at this time; therefore, the only time ELL students are assessed  in two languages is when the English NYSITELL indicates that the student may be dominant in their native language. At that  time, the NYSITELL will be administered in the ELL student’s native language.        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    BELL Academy  does not have any activities in place before the beginning of the school year to assist newly enrolled students;  however  BELL Academy does have several activities to assist ELL's at the start of the school year and during the school year.  These include parent orientation breakfasts, open school night, and the pairing of newcomers with bilingual students to assist  them. In addition, the school provide numerous activities that involves students and parents such as: Family Night, the Autumn  dance, Math Game Night in January, Valentines Day activities in January, Burger King Night, The BELL Academy  Carnival,  Father and mother appreciation breakfast/program and parent meetings to help parents work with their children on  test preparation for the ELA and Math.          17.

Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  3)   The ESL teacher work with classroom teachers to help students develop skills they will need in middle school such as note  taking techniques, listening skills, filling out graphic organizers and following multi-step directions.  The guidance counselor  holds a meeting with parents to talk about kids adjusting to middle school. The ESL and classroom teachers provide direct  instruction in content area vocabulary and materials and use data to analyze students' strengths and weaknesses on  standardized tests. Students visit local middle schools as well. Instruction is rigorous in preparation for the middle school  grades. Item analysis is utilized in lesson planning in order to address student needs. In the general ed classrooms, students sit  together on round tables, rather than the traditional square desks. The students store their books underneath chairs. During  IIM, students work with other teachers on the grade. These strategies help the ELL students transition from classroom to  classroom, which is done in middle school  daily.      The following professional development sessions have taken place or are planned for all teachers of ELLs including our ESL  teacher and classroom teachers who service ELLs.  These professional development sessions will serve to the mandated  training required.  These professional development opportunities will be taking place during Chancellor’s Conference Days and  monthly faculty conferences.     •     Using Data to Drive Instruction  •     Differentiation  •     Guided Reading  •     Schoolwide Enrichment Model  •     Independent Investigation Method       The ELL Teacher also meets with the classroom teachers individually and discuss strategies  for each ELL.

Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?    The ESL teacher meets individually with parents of ELL's at least once a year, in addition to parent teacher conferences and  initial parent orientations. This meeting is to discuss the goals of the program, the child's language development  progress,  English language assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. This additional meeting  includes the necessary staff to inform th parents about their child's language development. The meeting is conducted with a  translator in the language of the parents preferred language. Attendance is recorded using existing procedures.                2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   BELL Academy                                                                              School DBN: 25Q294  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
