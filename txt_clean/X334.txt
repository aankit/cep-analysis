This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      The mission of International Community High School is for all constituents to collaboratively answer the inquiry  question, "How does a South Bronx high school for at-risk English Language Learners effectively serve students and  their families?" There is no one correct answer, but together we have developed a collection of best practices that   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      continues to improve student achievement and validates the heroic efforts made by our student's families to move  and establish a life in a new and challenging English speaking society.          2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    We are a school compelled to find the best answer to, “How does a South Bronx high school for at-risk English  Language Learners effectively serve students and their families?” The answer to this question lies in the Framework  for Great Schools.      Since opening in September 2006, our approach in addressing this question has been to engage in continuous cycles  of improvement driven by analyzing data to inform changes within our original systems and structures. As a school for  newly arrived immigrant students learning English (ENLs), all of our students have been in the United States for less  than four years when they enroll with us and have an English Proficiency Level of "transitioning" or below. Our 414  students come from 32 different countries and speak 14 different home languages. When analyzing data gathered  from our students as they enter our school, around 40% of our students have low literacy levels in their home  language ranging from Pre-K to 3rd grade. Between 40-50%, enter with home language literacy levels between 4th to  7th grade in their native language. The remaining 10-20% of our students are at or above grade level in their home  language.      Our school has designed special programs to supplement the required graduation courses to meet the needs of such  an academically diverse population. We are part of the NYC DOE initiatives such as: (1) Computer Science for All  culminating in AP Computer Science, (2) College Access for All providing college and career ready courses to 9th and  10th graders using the College Action Research and Access scientifically researched curriculum, fully developed 11th  grade internship program, and 12th grade college & career support classes and small group graduation mentoring,  and (3) Single Shepherd reducing the counseling student ratio down to 1:100--allowing every grade to have their own  guidance counselor--plus a separate college and career counselor with a small part-time college enrollment team for  9-12th graders, and a transcript academic counseling specialist training our new Single Shepherd counselors.  Furthermore, we have: (1) a College Now program with Hostos Community College available throughout the academic  year and the summer, (2) One Goal classes on site where a college coach/teacher follows 11th graders until the first  week of their second year in college to help students persist & graduate from higher educational institutions, (3)  NYSED sponsored Bridges program to support students entering at Pre-K-12th grade levels, (4) Consortium Honors  College Preparatory Courses such as Statistics, Nuclear Chemistry, and Looking for An Argument, and (5) the use of  Reading Plus and Khan Academy to support ALL students raise their English reading and mathematical proficiency  levels from elementary to college mastery.       Note that ELL research has constantly demonstrated that students with higher levels of home language literacy have a  much higher probability of showing mastery in a new academic language within 6-9 years. The lower the home  language literacy level, the more difficulty a student will experience in making a successful transition to a new  academic language necessary to be considered college ready. Given this information, the first step in contextualizing  our data is recognizing that not all ELL’s in the NYC school system are the same. Many other schools have a much  higher concentration of students arriving at or above literacy levels in their home language, yet are compared in  similar ways to schools with a high percentage of students arriving below grade level in their home language.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Nonetheless, our students are accelerating the acquisition of academic English through our course offerings,  partnerships, and school wide systems and structures that allow for such innovation.       Despite the statistical probabilities working against our student population, we take pride in having an average of  about 69% of our students graduate within 6 years. Our school outperformed several schools with similar populations  in New York City and New York State. However, we are not satisfied with a 31% drop out rate. And though we still  have important progress to make, our student achievement, as measured by our 4 and 6 year graduation rates, has  improved thanks to the six elements of the Framework for Great schools.            3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   80% of our students enter with literacy and mathematical skills below grade level in their home language.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Rigorous Instruction & Collaborative Teachers     Established our college readiness program by becoming a full member of the New York State Performance   Based Consortium where our students graduate with the English Regents and four major Performance Based  Tasks (PBAT’s): literary essay, historical research paper, science research project with lab report, and math  application project.      Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative Teachers & Strong Family-Community Ties     Expanded our career readiness, 11th grade internship, and advisory program through the collaboration of   Bronx Teens Connection, our ICHS Science Department, and the ICHS Advisory Committee.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     ● Since the opening of our school, our students have engaged in two portfolio presentation in the 9th, 10th & 11th  grades and one major graduation portfolio presentation in the 12th grade. The performance based tasks (PBAT’s)  involved in the graduation portfolio include writing a literary essay, research paper, science lab report, and math  application project, which are all designed to actively prepare students for the rigor of college work.    ● In shifting to the Common Core Standards, it is necessary for departments to explicitly align the portfolio tasks to  the CCLS targets and track student growth on the PBAT’s throughout the four years. The analysis of student  performance on the PBAT’s identified priorities, language development & content connections, for strengthening the  vertical alignment in the curriculum within each department.   ● In 2014-2015, we had the privilege of becoming full members of the New York Performance Standards Consortium.  Membership means that we are administering the English Regents exam along with the four major Performance  Based Tasks (PBAT’s): literary essay, historical research paper, science research project with lab report, and math  application project. Consequently, our teachers, academic coaches, and administration will be invested in a much  more in-depth review of the alignment of PBAT performance outcomes throughout the 4 year department sequence.    STRENGTHS:     The 2017-2018 Quality Review rated ICHS as "proficient" in two components of the Instructional Core (1.2)   Develop teacher pedagogy, and (2.2) align assessments to curricula and "well developed" in (1.1) Ensure  engaging, rigorous, and coherent curricula, . In the area of pedagogy (1.2) the review found that, "Across  classrooms, teachers provided opportunities for students to share content in the language of a student's  choice. Teacher practice reflects the use of these practices."      The 2016-2017 School Survey found that we scored above the city-wide average in all five areas, including         Rigorous Instruction where we scored a 86% compared to the citywide average of 79%.  ICHS implemented school wide use of a one-page graphic organizer for unit plans, Rhonda Bondie's Clarity  Planner. In keeping with our philosophy of mastery-based learning, teachers keep student outcomes at the  center of this graphic organizer, ensured that all outcomes were assessed during the unit, and described  mastery at three levels for each outcome: competent, good, outstanding.  Interdisciplinary teams have been steadily building systems to ensure all students are presenting in all grades.  Even if a student has very low English proficiency or a low academic skill level when they start presenting in  9th grade, the experience and targeted feedback they get from each presentation builds towards their  eventual ability to pass the rigorous graduation PBAT presentations.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14         NEEDS:     Although rated proficient in Pedagogy (1.2) on both the 2017-2018 and 2015-2016 Quality Review, in 2015-  2016, the reviewer noted that, "Although lessons observed included multiple entry points and students were  engaged, higher-order thinking questions, while present in planning documents, were not observed across all  classrooms."      Our staff needs to consistently developing projects that require students to use higher order thinking skills      through out all stages of the project.  In order to get the feedback they need to improve, all our students need to complete their written work and  to present twice a year. Continuing to develop our teachers capacity for formative feedback and our students  abilities to self-regulate will ensure that more students complete more work, on which they receive more  useful feedback, and therefore are even more able to progress.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, at least 80% of students in each interdisciplinary team will pass a written PBAT in each subject and oral  presentation with a grade of "competent" or higher.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

By February 28, 2019 at least 50% of students in each interdisciplinary team will pass a written PBAT in each subject  and oral presentation with a grade of "competent" or higher on both the NYS Performance Assessment Consortium  discipline-specific rubric and, for grades 9-11, the ICHS Oral Presentation Rubric. (Graduation PBATs require the use of  the oral presentation band of the Consortium rubrics.)      Using Excel, we will be able to review scores on the:      ● 9 th & 10 th gradePBAT’s & presentations in all four content areas    ● 11 th grade PBAT’s & presentations in two content areas   ● 12 th grade Graduation PBAT’s & presentations in two content areas      While analyzing this data by classes, we will be able to identify which performance indicators need to be supported  better by departments & interdisciplinary teams.     Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January  Regents, etc.)  The NYS Performance Assessment Consortium discipline-specific rubrics will be used to evaluate both written student  work and oral presentations of that work. These rubrics are available online at:      http://www.performanceassessment.org/rubrics/      The current versions of the Consortium rubrics for the areas of English Language Arts, Social Studies, Mathematics,  Science and STEM will be used as appropriate. The number of performance indicators in each rubric vary by discipline  and not all bands will be used for all grade levels.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          18         The ICHS Vertical Alignment Plan indicates which bands are assessed for each grade level. In grades 9-11, written  work will be evaluated by the classroom teacher and oral presentations will be evaluated via consensus by a teacher,  classmates, and family members. For graduation (12th grade) PBATs, two readers assess the written work of the  student and both must rate it at a "competent" level or above for all performance indicators in order for students to  "pass". In 12th grade, at least one outside evaluator will be on each graduation PBAT panel, along with faculty  members, fellow students, and, whenever possible, family members.      Interdisciplinary Teams will enter student scores on each indicator into Excel (or Google Sheets) so that we can  generate the data needed. This will happen for both written work and oral presentations.     Part 5c.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Our school feels strongly that we progress most effectively by meeting the socio-emotional needs of all community  members. We have always worked towards this goal through partnerships with a number of CBO’s:   ● The Morris Heights Health Center School Based Clinic provides our students with access both to medical care,  reproductive health counseling, and a bilingual (Spanish) social worker.    ● Sauti Yetu , provides literacy support for students as well as social services to families.   ● The Center For Urban Pedagogy (CUP) provides training for participating teacher and classroom instruction on  special urban government projects.    ● Safety with Dignity trains and coordinates our our peer mediators, who performed over 60 mediation sessions last  year and works with our Dean and 10-month AP to provide in-house pd on Restorative Practices.   ● Over the past year and a half, twenty-one staff members have attended the Morningside Heights Center /DOE  Office of Safety and Youth Development's 5-day professional development series, Restorative Circles: Fostering  Teachers' and Students' Social and Emotional Learning through the Building and Belonging curriculum, Grades 6-12.  Another twelve staff members are scheduled to attend the Fall 2017 trainings.   ● ReServe provides part-time college counselor to help all of our students apply.    ● Behind the Book connects a visiting author collaborates with our 12th Grade English teacher. The students read the  author's book, the author comes to the school to speak to students about the writing process and engage them in  creative writing activities, and at the end of the partnership, Behind the Book publishes a book that includes the  creative writing and visual art the students have produced. This will be the third year ICHS has worked with Behind  the Book.   ● Bronx Arts Ensemble provides consulting artists who offer Capoeira, Yoga, Dance and Martial Arts classes to our  students.   ● For entering SIFE students and others with native-language literacy below the third-grade level, we offer a special  one-year curriculum through Bridges to Academic Success , a collaborative project of RISLUS and CASE at the CUNY  Graduate Center. EngageNY is currently funding the continued development of the Bridges ELA units.   ● Our 11 th grade internship class placed over 100 students in 10-week, all-day Friday internships with diverse non- profit organizations throughout the city, as well as provide them a year long class to develop the skills that will make  them successful in the workplace.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          20      ● Through the Chancellor's Single Shepherd initiative, ICHS has a new Social Worker and two more guidance  counselors, bringing our total guidance staff to four guidance counselors, a social worker, a dean, and a full-time  SAPIS worker for 450 students.          STRENGTHS:     The 2017-2018 Quality Review cited Teacher Support and Supervision as an area of celebration, rating ICHS as   "well developed" in (3.4) Establish a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff,  students, and families, and provides supports to achieve those expectations. The reviewer stated that,  "School leaders consistently communicate high expectations to the entire staff, and provide training for those  expectations. Teacher teams and staff establish a culture for learning that systematically communicates a  unified set of high expectations for all students and provide clear, focused and effective feedback and  guidance supports."     The 2016-2017 NYC School Survey report found us to be above average in the all five areas, most relevantly in   Supportive Environment, Strong Family-Community Ties, and Trust. We were rated at 93% for Trust which is  six percentage points higher than both the citywide average and borough average. ICHS was also fourteen  percentage points higher than the citywide average in Supportive Environment.      NEEDS:     As a school designed to meet the needs of new immigrants, ICHS strategically plans structures in our school to   support newly arrived students. At the same time, other subgroups that we strive to serve effectively are  students in temporary housing, especially those "doubled up", students who are expecting and/or new  parents, low income students who may be pressured by their families to leave school to earn income to help  support the family, and students whose cultures or families expect them to stop school for early marriage.    We must prevent drop outs by ensuring all students, especially those who arrive in the US with low native   language literacy, experience success in school and see classes and coursework as relevant to their lives. For  example, of the 90 students in Cohort R, 61 students graduated in four years, 17 students have dropped out  and 12 more are still working towards graduation, nine here with us at ICHS and three more at YABC  programs. For future cohorts, we want to reduce the number of drop outs and increase the number of  graduations.     When we look at the 17 students in Cohort R who dropped out, all of them were identified as below grade  level in native language literacy when they were initially admitted to the school. ICHS has high numbers of  students with interrupted formal education (SIFE) and others who may not have had interruptions but still  come to us with low native language literacy. Our current RSFE report lists 185 students, approximately 45%  of all our students! On that report 157 of our 414 students are listed as SIFE students and are currently still  ELLs. Another 28 students were once identified as SIFE and are former ELLs. Developing student literacy and  numeracy systematically across all grade levels is key to keeping these students engaged and successful in  school.     The ROAG report in ATS indicates that 20% of our students are overage for their grade level. For many of our  students, the pressure to contribute financially to their families rises as they age. If they do not find school to  be a respectful environment that appreciates their strengths, students may be more inclined to leave school  in favor of a job that helps them support their families.

STRENGTHS:   In keeping with the INPS principles of One Learning Model for All and Localized Autonomy and Responsibility, ICHS  has a number of existing structures for distributed leadership that meet regularly:      Interdisciplinary Teams - Meet twice weekly during the school day. Members include a least four teachers, a  guidance counselor, and any paraprofessionals assigned to students within the team. One of the teachers on  the team serves as the Team Leader and represents the team in the weekly Teacher Leadership meeting.     Departmental Teams - Meet once weekly during the school day, all teachers in the department   (approximately 5-8 teachers), and the Department's Instructional Coach. One teacher serves as the  Department Facilitator and represents the team in the weekly Teacher Leadership meeting. Most Department  Facilitators plan the agenda in conjunction with the Department's Instructional Coach, some plan  Departments use the end of each meeting to collectively plan the agenda for the next meeting.     Teacher Leadership Committee - Meets once weekly outside of the school day. Members include the   facilitators of all departments, Interdisciplinary team leader from each team, PBAT Coordinator, all guidance  counselors, and all school administrators. Meetings are facilitated by two teachers who co-chair the  committee and meet weekly with the Principal to plan the agenda.  School Leadership Team (SLT) - Meets monthly and is composed of students, families, and school staff.  Agendas are written by the Parent Coordinator and Principal. A major function of the SLT is to produce the  agenda for monthly Saturday Parents Association (PA) meetings.        Academic Coaches - All Departmental Instructional Coaches and Administrators meet monthly. The 12-month      Assistant Principal writes the agenda and facilitates the meeting. Instructional Coaches turn-key content  through Department meetings, individual meetings with teachers, and occasionally, school wide pds.  Special Education Committee - Meets once weekly during the school day, Members include both Special Ed  and General Education teachers, paraprofessionals and guidance counselors, the school social worker, and all  school administrators. A special education teacher writes the agenda and facilitates the meeting.     Cabinet - Meets once weekly during the school day. Members include all administrators, guidance counselors,  the school social worker, and the three teachers with comp-time positions: (1) the ELL & Testing Coordinator,  (2) the PBAT Coordinator, and (3) the Programmer & Data Specialist. The 12-month Assistant Principal writes  the agenda and facilitates the meeting. All members can suggest agenda items either at the end of the  meeting or via email.     Guidance Team - Meet once weekly during the school day. Members include all administrators, the dean, all   guidance counselors, the school social worker and the Substance Abuse and Prevention Intervention  Specialist (SAPIS) worker. The 12-month Assistant Principal writes the agenda and facilitates the meeting. All  members can suggest agenda items either at the end of the meeting or via email.  Security Team- Meet once weekly during the school day. Members include all support staff members who  have security posts during entry, lunch and dismissal. The Dean, 10-month AP and a representative from  Safety with Dignity write the agendas and facilitate the meetings.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          28   Formative Feedback for Staff - As a school dedicated to mastery-based learning, and in keeping with the INPS  principle of One Learning Model for All, in addition to required MOTP visits, administration has always set  goals for low stakes classroom visits that teachers low stakes formative feedback. For example, last year our  goal was for teachers to have a minimum of ten classroom visits that included both MOTP observations and  unrated, formative walk through visits for all teachers.            NEEDS:   Our teachers have asked for more frequent formal feedback on their instructional practice.    Specifically, in our past efforts to conduct multiple formative visits before observations that count towards MOTP  ratings, summative observations occurred later in the school year. Teachers stated that they want both formative and  summative feedback throughout the year. This has resulted in our current goal of ensuring a minimum of one  summative and three formative visits to every teacher each semester. Since some of our teachers elect the PROSE  option, that only requires two MOTP observations by an administrator each year, the inclusion of lowstakes formative  feedback allows us to provided consistent visits and feedback throughout the year.   As part of the process of memorializing our low stakes formative feedback, "Glows and Grows" for each visit are  recorded in TeachBoost. This feedback is now printed and signed by the administrator and teacher. As well as these  hard copies, teachers also have electronic access to all completed reports in TeachBoost, including both formative  feedback and MOTP reports.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.     By Friday , February 1, 2019, administrators will have completed at least one MOTP and at least 3 low stakes   visits for each teacher. By Friday, May 24th, 2019, administrators will complete all required MOTP written  observations and remaining lowstakes visits for a total of 10 observations.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          29     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

The Principal will devote 60% of the instructional time each  week to classroom observations and feedback, the 12-month  Assistant Principal will devote 40% of the instructional time  each week to classroom observations and feedback, and the  10-month Assistant Principal will devote 20% of the  instructional time each week to classroom observations and  feedback. This works out to approximately 15 hours per week  for the Principal and 10 and 5 hours per week respectively for  the two Assistant Principals.   In addition to the formative and summative feedback from  administrators, teachers will also receive coaching visits and  follow-up meetings from Instructional Coaches. In most  cases, these will be discipline-based coaching visits but new  teachers will also have additional coaching.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   STRENGTHS:     We have a strong family presence during Saturday Parent Association events. Usually, there are over 50   families represented and Spanish and French interpretation occur during the meeting. Other languages are  provided when needed.     Our Interdisciplinary Teams build strong relationships with students' families through phone calls,   conferences and home visits. During conferences, families meet with teams not individual teachers. The  teams either set up stations so that the families circulate the room and meet with each teacher in turn or  have one or two teachers relate the team's observations, concerns and appreciations to the family.   Student volunteers give sample PBAT presentations at Saturday Parent Association meetings and families are  invited to students' mini-PBAT, PBAT and graduation PBAT presentations.        College planning is a topic in multiple Parent Association meetings and several workshops specifically target   the families of 11th and 12th graders. For example, we offer a yearly FAFSA workshop for the families of 12th  graders.       OPPORTUNITIES:   In all most all of these family events, there are many more parents than staff members and our ability to provide  individual attention is limited. In order to maximize the impact of our many college initiatives and advocate for  students as fully as possible, our current goal is to have individual meetings with at least 80% of all our students with a  family member present (parent, guardian or emergency contact) around the student's college and career readiness.      CHALLENGES:   Since all of our students start ICHS having been in the country for four years or less, the United States higher  education system is completely new to them. We need to introduce them to the college application process, financial  aid opportunities, and career training programs. Additional complexities to these conversations include the generally  low economic resources of our students families (over 90% Title I), a variety of immigration statuses (sometimes even  within the same family), and cultural expectations families have for our students. One specific example of a cultural  expectation challenge includes family expectations of early marriage for our Yemini, Bengali, and West African female  students.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.      By Friday, May 31st, 2019, 80% of students, in the presence of parent/guardian/or emergency contact (for students who  are 18+ years old), will have had one meeting with a staff member regarding college and career readiness for the 2018- 2019 academic year.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools element,  including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Our Teacher Leadership Committee meets every Friday from 7:55 am to 8:55 am. The Leadership Committee has a  teacher representative from each team, academic department, committee, guidance, UFT representative and  administration meet to consider major instructional concerns. Through lengthy conversations that continue in  separate team and department meetings, feedback around multiple assessment measures and professional  development are collected. Then the Teacher Leadership Committee develops and implements the plans that have  been informed with feedback from as many teachers as possible. We also have our MOSL committee that was  activated at the beginning of the year who assisted with this until our Teacher Leadership Committee was finalized  and began meeting in November. Furthermore, our UFT Consultation Committee that also gets to express feedback  on any concerns. Some of our major assessment breakthroughs include the administration & use of mock regents  exams, ALEKS, Rosetta Stone, & Reading Plus in addition to keeping track of student progress on the Regents exams.  The information from the analysis informs third period intervention placement, after school & Saturday tutorials, and  special team &/or department wide initiatives.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45           Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. International Community High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   International Community High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

In house and outsourced professional development sessions are offered to any staff member in  the school. To ensure that the professional development sessions meet the needs of teachers, the  ESL/Bilingual Coordinator is in constant contact with the PD leader at the school to coordinate  them.   Teachers who share the co-teaching after school programs have common prep periods during the  school day or have meeting times included on their schedules to perform the co-planning  process. Also they are allowed to have after-school per-session planning time.  All teachers at ICHS teach ELLs.  Therefore all workshops are aimed at providing them with  strategies and best practices that serve the ELL population at ICHS a project-based assessment  school.      There are two main professional development series throughout the year.  Both series are led by  people who are experts in their particular field of education and servicing ELLs.  The purpose of  all professional development sessions is to offer teachers strategies and pedagogical information  to effectively teach ELLs. The INPS Strategies for Teaching ELLs is held by Maria Kayal, an  instruction coach with the International Network for Public Schools. Ms. Kayal  The specific  workshops are outlined below.  The second series of workshops are part of the ALL-ED, a series  of pedagogical strategies developed by Fordham University professor of Education, Dr. Rhonda  Bondi and proved to increase student engagement and participation in ELL classrooms.   1.- INPS Professional Development on Strategies for Teaching ELLs  Schedule: September 4th 2018, November 6th 2018, January 28th 2019, June 6th 2019  These workshops provide new teachers with opportunities to define what project-based learning  is, develop their own driving questions, distinguish between higher order thinking and lower  level thinking tasks, and understanding the common pitfalls of project-based learning and how to  address them.  Teachers are also given a template for developing a project using backwards  planning.   Additional approaches help teachers with common issues that arise in classrooms  populated by 100% ELL students.  These workshops are led by Maria Kayal, an expert teacher  and a consultant for the International Network for Public Schools.  Additionally, these  workshops follow the instructional models provided by the Internationals Network for Public  Schools, who cater only to recent immigrant high school students.  1a) Introduction / Defining a Good Project :  This workshop series enables educators at varying  levels of experience with project-based learning to deepen their knowledge of designing effective  project-based units aligned to the Common Core State Standards.  This is particularly important  for all ELLs as it is a part of the current academic culture at ICHS.  1b) Project Analysis / Pitfalls of Project-Based Learning :  In this workshop, teachers learn and  understand the essential characteristics of a rigorous, engaging project.  They also identify new  sources of inspiration in developing ideas for projects.  This includes learning how to integrate  different types of motivating activities into curriculum.   The second part of the workshop entails  learning how to avoid the common pitfalls of project-based learning.      1c) Developing Driving Questions to Promote Higher Order Thinking :   This workshop provides  faculty with core strategies to enable students at different academic and English proficiency   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         Part C: Professional Development   levels to access academically rigorous curriculum at a variety of entry points.  Teachers learn to  how to create compelling diving questions to guide students’ work by engaging in activities to  develop the higher-order thinking skills of their students.    1d) Aligning Discipline-Based Language Objectives to Effective Content Objectives :  Teaching  sheltered content to ELLs is challenging in that students are expected to learn content and  language simultaneously.  The challenge to teachers is that one cannot be learned without the  other.  This workshop offers teachers the opportunity develop effective and integrated language  and content objectives for designing projects aligned with the Common Core State  Standards.   This includes partaking in activities that will develop familiarity with the different  types of language functions students need and ways to scaffold support for students’ using those  language functions.    1e) Project Planning Templates and Formative Assessments : Teachers receive training in  completing detailed project plans that break down unit objectives into weekly and daily  objectives.  These objectives are then aligned with activities and assessments.  Teachers engage  in activities and discussions that emphasize the importance of formative assessment and its role  in project-based learning among ELLs.  They are also provided with the Internationals’ Project  Planning template for projects.    2.- Additional PDS  2a) Active Board Training (September 7th 2018) : All ICHS teachers will participate in Active  Board training to be used with ELL students to create student products that enhance reading,  speaking, and writing skills.  Training will be led by an Active Board Expert referred to by the  vendor of Active Board products.  2b) Jump Rope Training (September 28th 2018) : All ICHS teachers will participate in Jump  Rope training to be used for outcomes based grading and involving ELL students in the feedback  process that outcomes based grading entails. Training will be led by an Jump Rope Expert  referred to by the vendor of Jump Rope products.  2c) Reading Plus Training (October 12th 2018) : All content-area teachers of ELLs will  participate in Reading Plus training to be used by students to increase literacy in  English.  Training will be led by Karolyn Piscardo, a literacy specialist and account manager for  Reading Plus.  2d) ICHS End of Year Teachers Portfolio Presentations (June 25th 2019 from 8:00 am - 2:00  pm) : In following the tradition of project-based learning at ICHS, all teachers will present their  best practices and successes through the lens of their department.  These presentations will focus  on the application of the strategies learned through the INPS and ALL-ED professional  development sessions.  Teachers will explain how ELL students developed throughout the school  year and any changes or additions they recommend going forward.  2e) Coaching PD days: Additionally one day a month, department coaches lead the department  meetings and stay in the school with teachers to run observations and individual coaching  sessions. The purpose of assigning a coach to each department is to provide pedagogical support,  resources and aid in curriculum development to teachers in each content area.  These four  coaches come twice / week and meet with teachers during common prep times. All coaches have  been former classroom teachers with several years of experience and some are currently active  university adjunct professors.

Workshops center around a  text that will be distributed to parents “How to Talk so Teens Will Listen & Listen So Teens Will  Talk” by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish.  The text will be available in English and  Spanish.  Translations of text and activities during the workshop will be provided as  needed.  This service is provided for parents with the intent of promoting positive family  relationships between parents, at-risk ELLs, and the school.    College / Career Preparation Sessions: September 26th (5:00 pm - 7:00 pm), November 29th  (5:00 pm- 7:00 pm) and 30th (1:00 pm - 2:00 pm )  / March 07th (5:00 pm - 7:00 pm) and 08th  (1:00 pm to 3:00 pm) and May 09th (5:00 pm - 7:00 pm).  The College / Career Preparation Sessions will be facilitated by Joanne Dilauro (College and  Career counselor and ESL certified teacher). Sessions broken into three separate  languages.  Three 2-hour sessions to be provided during to the following months to inform  parents of specific milestones in the college application process.  September- Introduction to  College; November, January - Financial Aid; March - Support Services; May - Transitioning.  PBAT Support information Session:  Dec 08th, Jan 19th, Feb 09th, Apr 13th, Jun 8th..  (1:00  pm- 1:30 pm)  These PBAT Support Information Sessions will be facilitated by principal, Berena  Cabarcas.  The information session is meant to provide parents (specifically of new students)  with the graduation assessments performed in every grade.  The workshop will consist of  presenting parents with strategies for supporting ELLs, interpretation and translation of Rubric,  model presentations by student volunteers, and instructions for additional supports provided by  ICHS which promote language, literacy and other academic skills (i.e Rosetta Stone, Reading  Plus and Alex software).  What is Jumprope and How to Use it:   October 20th  (1:00 pm - 2:00 pm)  Jumprope is the current software used by teachers, students, staff and parents for communication  and feedback on academic progress and grades.  This workshop is intended for both parents and  students to learn how to navigate and stay informed of students academic progress and language  growth.  Additionally, the student comments section, informs parents of character / behavioral  observations.  Information sessions are held by multiple staff, depending on the language  needs.  Some experts include Eva Sievert-Schiller (Assistant Principal), Ernesto Tabajonda  (Math / Lead Teacher).     Communication is key in ensuring the academic success of students and parent involvement and  support is essential in order to achieve this. As critical as it is for our parents and families to be  fully informed about all aspects of their child education, it is just as important that we have the  appropriate mechanisms in place to make parents feedback and involvement a given rather than a  struggle.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    In addition to ICHS' open-door policy, all parents are invited to monthly Parent Association  Meetings, hold during Saturdays. After our Parent Teacher Association (PTA) meetings we run a  Family Engagement program, in order to cover in detail more parent related topics that impact  achievement of immigrant students and also to allow teachers to run the Saturday programs.  We  encourage parents to come with their kids to the school so meanwhile the parents are in these  parent sessions, the students are doing regents preparation sessions. We use staff or external  translators that are present to interpret information for families as needed. Phone calls and fliers  in multiple languages are used to notify parents of meetings. In order to do that, coverage and per  session must be provided.  Four parent-teacher meetings (PTC) are held throughout the school year.  Two in the fall and two  in the spring. During all these meetings, parents are informed about the student performance and  also about the after school activities and Saturday programs that could help to improve the  student skills and knowledge. Student rubrics are translated into different languages.  Translators  are always available in order to ensure that all information is shared accurately and the ideas and  concerns of parents are addressed.   Parental involvement in the school is high, with an average of 90 families attending the Saturday  monthly meetings and around 300 family drop-ins (visits) to school per academic year.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Currently the school is using teacher created assessments and LENS assessments to evaluate the early literacy skills and  numeracy skills of all new enrolled students in their native language.  The LENS is a multilingual suite of diagnostics designed to  measure the home-language literacy skills students bring with them when they enter New York City schools. This information  will be highly informative for teachers since students come in with a range of skills in both literacy and math, and knowing  each individual student’s strengths and weaknesses is essential for teachers to plan instruction. This is the fourth year that this  method of assessment is being used and it is continually being evaluated and improved on an ongoing basis. The data collected  from this enrollment process is used to determine which (if any) literacy intervention the students should be receiving, and to  monitor their progress throughout the school year (and thus the effectiveness of the literacy programs). The data from the  LENS assessment showed that more than 80% of the newcomers enter the school with a gap of two or more years of content   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         knowledge, even when students were attending their previous schools regularly.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The school enrollment process requires that every new student (newcomer or coming from other NYC schools) take the three  mentioned assessments. Based on the results of the assessments, the student is assigned to a specific team of teachers if it's  beneficial for the student. A copy of the assessments are handle to the team of teachers in order to plan a proper instruction  strategy.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of the ELL programs is determined by examining graduation rates (and length of time taken to matriculate), course  pass rates, regents pass rates, and portfolio grades. These results are consistently reviewed at a team, department and school  wide levels to better determine the effectiveness of school programming. ICHS continues to track data about graduates, to  determine whether student choices post-graduation reflect ICHS's core values and philosophies, and to identify whether or not  students have reached skill levels proficient enough to allow them to comfortably pursue meaningful post-graduation  activities.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Every teacher team meet twice a week to share information about the students in their own team and also to plan strategies  and practices that will benefit their students. On these meetings they periodically receive the summative data that the school  gather and proceed to take action based on it. Interventions are planned and followed up.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]           6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   NYSESLAT scores revels that in grades 9 and 10, students are grouped among the entering and emerging proficiency level. At  11th grade the distribution among the intermediate levels is more equivalent and at 12th grade is when students are starting  to achieve the commanding level with around 50% of the cohort achieving this level. Also data shows that across the school  students tend to be stronger in listening and speaking with reading and writing scores increasing at grades 11 and 12. Results  indicate that students make steady progress in all areas from 9th - 10th grade.  The NYSITELL scores demonstrate that the English knowledge of the newcomers this year tends to be according to  expectations for newcomers since 70% scored at the beginner level (Entering/Emerging), 25 % scored at the Transitioning level  and 5% scored at the advanced level.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Every teacher team meet twice a week to share information about the students in their own team and also to plan strategies  and practices that will benefit their students. On these meetings the school ESL coordinator periodically shares information  from the ELL Data Analysis tool, NYSESLAT and NYSITELL tests and the ELA regents.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Instruction at our school is delivered collaboratively by teams of four to five teachers who work to plan instruction for  groups of approximately 80 students divided in 3 classes. All our teams uses the Stand-Alone ENL model. A teacher  who is generally the English ESL instructor develop the English language needed for academic success. Additionally  some teams, who also have a dual content-ESL certified teacher, use the Integrated ENL/ESL  model where the  content area teacher incorporates ESL methodologies in his/her instruction. Each group of students is block  programmed and those students travel together throughout the day.  Within their blocks, 9th and 10th grade  students are mixed, as are 11th and 12th grade students.  The blocks are heterogeneous but at various times teachers  may choose to group students within the block homogeneously if that suits the students’ and block’s needs for a  specific project.   b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              As per the new CR Part 154 requirements, beginning September 2015, students will be carefully programmed to receive  the mandated ENL and ELA instructional minutes based on new proficiency guidelines.  Beginners/Entering students will  receive a minimum of 540 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 180 minutes of ENL standalone, 180 minutes of integrated  ENL/ELA and 180 minutes of standalone or intergrated ENL with ELA or any other content area).  Low Intermediates/Emerging  will receive 360 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 90 minutes of standalone ENL, 180 minutes of integrated  ENL/ELA  and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area.)  Intermediate/Transitioning  willl receive 180 ENL minutes per week (this consists of 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area and 90  minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area). Advanced/Expanding will receive 180 minutes of  ENL per week (this consists of 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.)  Proficient/Commanding or students  who are former ELL's will receive 90 minutes of ENL each week (this consists of 90 integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.)   We have a series of delivery models to ensure that each student receives these mandated ESL and ELA minutes through  discrete ESL classes as well as many classes taught by dual certified ESL/content area teachers. (ie: teachers who have dual  certification in both ESL and a content area such as ESL/English, ESL/Social Studies and ESL/Biology certification.) Each  instructional team includes at least one teacher who is licensed in ESL; in addition, all of our content area teachers are trained  in language development and ESL methodologies and encouraged to pursue ESL certification.  The school schedule and teacher  programming ensure that all entitled ESL students receive the mandated number of minutes required according to CR Part  154.  In addition to our regular content curriculum all ELL students are given extra ESL instruction in order to meet the number  of minutes they require of ESL instruction each week.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      At ICHS all classes implement the ESL instructional model. In order to do that, ICHS employs the Internationals Network for  Public Schools’ model in its approach to educating ELLs: The Internationals’ pedagogical approach to educating English  language learners is based on a Sheltered English Instruction model and has five major tenets:    • Heterogeneity and collaboration: content area classes are heterogeneous and have collaborative structures, such as group   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      inquiry projects that build on the strengths of each member of the school community to optimize learning.    • Experiential learning: students engage in meaningful investigative processes with real-life applications, including internships  and service learning.    • Language and content integration: strong language skills develop most effectively in context and emerge most naturally in a  purposeful, language-rich, interdisciplinary, and experiential program. Academic language and content is infused through  every content area, including literacy supports being present in all classrooms.    • Localized autonomy and responsibility: linking autonomy and responsibility at every level within a learning community  allows all members to contribute to their fullest potential.    • One learning model for all: every member of our school community experiences the same learning model, maximizing an  environment of mutual academic support. Thus all members of our school community work in diverse, collaborative groups on  hands-on projects. Pedagogues also work collaboratively with one another to maximize student achievement.     Using these reference points content is delivered in a way that meets the needs of all ELLs. This model allows for ELLs to have  multiple access points to content materials, including through project-based inquiry learning. All content instruction is in  English with Native Language supports available in all classrooms, age and level appropriate. All classes have dictionaries in  many languages, all teachers allows the use of electronic translators and allows the use of native language in class using other  students as translators. The INPS philosophies creates a learning environment where NL is seen as an asset, and the  heterogeneous model allows students to access content in either their NL (through instructional and peer supports) or in  English, while developing content knowledge and language skills.  ESL teachers support the content area teachers in  developing their materials by sharing with them ESL strategies and forms.    In order to provide our students with native language support in the content area we provide our students with bilingual  dictionaries, peer group support, native language texts, as well as bilingual paraprofessionals to assist in the classroom.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      New students are thoroughly screened during enrollment and in the first two weeks of school using reading and writing  assessments in their native language. Based on the assessments rubrics, the student’s literacy levels are determined.  Additionally, the Spanish version of the LENS is administered to all the new students with a home language of Spanish, to  determine reading and writing literacy grade level.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    A) Teachers differentiate for SIFE in accordance with an individual student’s needs. For ELA, Social Studies and Science,  content-area teachers use a differentiating method, leveling the students in three different levels according to their content  knowledge and skills, being the SIFE ELLs generally categorized in the lowest level. The materials teachers create for class  instruction (Activity guides) are also differentiated in those three levels according to the expected performance of these  students. For the math area we have a numeracy pull out program for those students demonstrating the biggest gap in  numeracy skills and knowledge. The numeracy program is aligned with the math schedule to allow students to obtain targeted  intervention during their regularly scheduled math period.      New students during enrollment and in the first two weeks of school are thoroughly screened using reading and writing  assessments in addition to the Oral Interview Questionnaire and LENS to determine SIFE with the highest academic needs.  Those students were registered in our intensive literacy and numeracy program for 9th graders (Bridges Program) which will  more fully prepare these students to access materials covered in later grades and close the gap between these students and  their peers, allowing them a greater chance of academic success and reducing the risk of dropping out. Students will work in a  smaller class size (fifteen to twenty students versus approximately thirty in ‘regular’ classes), allowing for teachers to give   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      more individualized attention. Historically these students have required additional time in school, either five or six years versus  four. Due to the overwhelmingly large gap between SIFE and other students in their heterogeneously grouped classes, even  with additional time several students still struggle and often make very slow or little progress at all. It is expected that Bridges  will provide these students with the foundational literacy and numeracy skills needed to perform competitively with their  peers in the years following the completion of their Bridges year.  In general SIFE students are supported through several initiatives and programs in the school:    i. Level appropriate native language materials in content classes.    ii. Small group numeracy instruction    iii. Small group literacy instruction    iv. After school instruction    v. Summer school enrichment    vi. Daily content-specific interventions    vii. Bridges Program     In addition to this, teachers receive on-going professional development (provided at school and network levels and also  external programs) in order to better understand and meet the needs of our students with no or low literacy in their native  language.     B) Upon entering ICHS, all students will have been in the USA for less than 4 years. The majority of our newcomers are in 9th  and 10th grade. Teachers differentiate for newcomer ELLs in accordance with an individual student’s needs. For ELA, Social  Studies and Science, content-area teachers use a differentiating method, leveling the students in three different levels  according to their content knowledge and skills. The materials teachers create for class instruction (Activity guides) are also  differentiated according to the expected performance of these students. Teachers also have glossaries and bilingual  dictionaries in the classrooms for ESL students. Teachers also have leveled independent reading books for students to use.  In order to fast-track their English and content knowledge and have them make the gains necessary for graduation and  successful completion of Regents examinations students are placed in daily intervention classes that speak to subject areas  that they struggle with the most. The following third period interventions and supports are available (daily, 240 minutes per  week):    i. Level 1 literacy    ii. Level 2 literacy    iii. Level 3 literacy    iv. ESL: Oral skills development    v. Global Studies    vi. Exploring Computer Science    vii. Algebra    viii. Pre-Calculus    ix. Living Environment    ix. Advanced Art    x. Life Skills    xi. SETTS (mandated students)     Access to after school and summer school programs are also made available to these students. The focus for students who  have been in the USA less than 3 years is English Language acquisition and literacy, though the above courses are available to  all students in order to accommodate the varied skill sets and needs of students. All ELLs also receive an advisory curriculum  which is tailored at various grade levels to meet the social-emotional needs of students adjusting to a new language and  culture.     C). At ICHS there is a reduced population of ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years (approximately 15%) due to the fact that we  primarily serve students who are arriving in 9th grade directly from their home countries. The majority of those students are  placed in 11th and 12th grade, and at this level college and career readiness are also included in their curriculum in the form of  College Summit and Internship programs. At these level teachers create tasks for students that are at different levels and give   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68      them the option to choose the level at which they could perform. Another form of differentiation within the class instruction is  the phase at which the students could work and achieve. Teachers also use diverse grouping strategies to differentiate  instruction for these subgroup of students.      D) There is a small percentage of Long-Term ELLs at ICHS (22 students) due to the fact that we primarily serve students who  are arriving in 9th grade directly from their home countries. Eighteen of them are 12th graders that need to complete some  credits, present their graduation portfolio or pass some regents in order to graduate. The rest are students with IEPs and they  have their own type of differentiated instruction based on their tests. The 12th grade students have the flexibility of partial  schedules to meet credit or graduation requirements. Teachers depending on the specific needs of those students prepare  differentiated tasks and class instruction materials. Also those students are continually followed up from our guidance  counselor in order to supervise their class performance and achievements.      E) At the present moment ICHS has no former ELLs (in years 1 and 2 after testing Proficient). In case there exist a student who  tested proficient on the initial years, the guidance counselor will review the student transcripts and after an interview with the  students will prepare a personalized schedule according to the student skills and content knowledge.            6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   If the IEP of an ELL-SWDs doesn’t entitle the student the support of a paraprofessional, they are always placed in classes where  at least one paraprofessional could work with them. Currently, all of our students with IEP's participate in general ed classes in  English, math, science and social studies. On these classes, teachers differentiate for ELLs in accordance with an individual  student’s needs, leveling the students in three different levels according to their content knowledge and skills. Teachers work  along with the paraprofessionals to make sure the student receive the appropriate differentiated material.  As an intervention  class they are registered in a SETTS support class where they receive differentiated support according to their IEPs  instructions.   Every week there is a Special Ed meeting with the participation of the principal, assistant principal, guidance counselors, and  Special Ed teachers (English and Math). In these meeting they discuss the status of the different programs available for ELL- SWDs in order to ensure that they receive all services mandated on their IEPs. All those classes incorporate ESL instruction  therefore for ELL-SWDs whose IEP mandates ESL instruction is ensured.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Currently, all of our students with IEP's participate in general ed classes in English, science, social studies, math and electives  with a third period SETTS support class. All classes follow the instructional approach outlined in section 6          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  ICHS offers the following targeted intervention programs for all students including ELLs. The programs run daily for 60 min  each:    i. Level 1 English literacy (Target ELL Beginner level - Newcomers)    ii. Level 2 English literacy (Target ELL Intermediate Level  -Newcomers )    iii. Level 3 English literacy (Target ELL Advanced level + Long term ELLs)    iv. ESL: Oral skills development through Rosetta Stone (Target Beginner and Intermediate level)    v. Social Studies (Target Intermediate and Advanced Level  ELLs+ Long term ELLs)    vi. Exploring Computer Science (Target Beginner and Intermediate level - Newcomer)    vii.

Life Skills (Enhance behavioral and living skills)(Target SIFE, ELL begginer and intermediate -Newcomer)     All interventions are offered in English with native language supports. Interventions also include small group instruction to  address social-emotional issues (such as aggression and retention issues) and in-class supports as designed by the students’  teaching teams such as additional native language materials.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?     Through ongoing professional development we will continue to refine the programs that are currently in place. Each  department and team will track student data and instructional practices in order to evaluate the effectiveness of programs  offered. In conjunction with the students use of instructional Internet based programs, we will be examining the ability of  students in the school to access increasingly complex texts across the school, enhance their English language and increase their  math content knowledge, through department lenses. It is the goal of this inquiry work to better understand how to prepare  students for the demands of college level curriculum.      Now that our SIFE Bridge program is in the consolidation phase, through extensive data analysis we will look to further  improving the Bridges Program, extend the bridges into the summer program and have our Bridges teachers coach the rest of  the 9th & 10th grade staff on specific intervention techniques in the regular classroom research.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None of our ESL programs will be discontinued.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  The model of our school enables all ELLs equal access to programming either for the intervention programs, the electives and  after school activities. All students participate in a survey where they are asked for their two main options for intervention  programs and electives. The students are programmed based on student input and where the team teachers believe it’s  convenient for the student, but changes could be made in case the student wants to participate in another intervention  period.   At the beginning of the year students are placed in specific gym electives according to student choice. On October, the  assistant principal announces the after school programs list and posts it in different parts of the school. All students have the  choice to attend any of these programs. They are only requested to speak to the teacher who will run the program and request  a permission slip to participate in it.     The Intervention programs are:     i. Level 1 English literacy (Target ELL Beginner level - Newcomers)    ii. Level 2 English literacy (Target ELL Intermediate Level  -Newcomers )    iii. Level 3 English literacy (Target ELL Advanced level + Long term ELLs)    iv. ESL: Oral skills development through Rosetta Stone (Target Beginner and Intermediate level)    v. Social Studies (Target Intermediate and Advanced Level  ELLs+ Long term ELLs)    vi. Exploring Computer Science (Target Beginner and Intermediate level - Newcomer)    vii. Algebra (Math regents prep) (Target Intermediate and Advanced level + Long term ELLs)    viii. Living Environment (Labs Prep) (Target Intermediate and Advanced level + Long term ELLs)    ix. Advanced Art (Target Advanced level - ELLs receiving 4 to 6 years)    x. Pre-Calculus (Advanced Math)(Target Advanced level – ELLs receiving 3 to 6 years )    xi. SETTS (IEP mandated instruction) (Target ELL-SWDs)    xii. SIFE Bridges (Target SIFE, ELL Beginner)    xiii.

What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  All students have equal access to bilingual texts, level-appropriate high interest texts, active boards and computers in all  classes, manipulatives and in some classes, additional bilingual adults as resources. Technology (active boards and computers)  are used to improve technology literacy, convey complex concepts through visuals and interactive activities and appeal to  multiple learning modalities. All ELA classes have books from different reading levels and also have books in different  languages to promote the reading skills of the ELLs. Math, science and social studies teachers, have reference texts that are  also available in different language versions.     This is the second year that ICHS is innovating on the widely use of instructional online software with very good results. Those  educational platforms are:     Reading Plus: Throughout the history of the school we have consistently seen students make significant gains in student  literacy through grades 9 and 10. The leap from 10th to 11th grade curriculum, lesson structures and class formats is routinely  the point at which students begin to suffer from failing grades and disengagement, as a direct result from an inability to access  increasingly complex texts at the same level as their peers. Most newcomers and SIFE students regularly encounter  instructional text that is too difficult for their current reading ability. The students with the lowest levels of literacy are  consistently those who drop out of school or result in delayed graduation. For this reason and based on a past year successful  pilot program, ICHS expanded the use of this Internet based reading program to the whole school meaning that all students  have an account in the program to use at school and at home. Reading Plus classes run at three different levels. We have a pull  out class for 11-12th graders who has a significant delay in their reading skills; this class is led by a specialized teacher trained  for this specific literacy development tool. Teachers are encouraged to incorporate this tool in their curriculum as a  differentiation instrument for those students who seem disengaged for classroom activities. As an intervention tool, the suite  is used in a third period intervention class (CTT) who uses primarily this software with students from 9th-10th grade that need  to develop reading skills.     Rosetta Stone: Each year ICHS faces a large number of students who enters the school without the necessary and basic  knowledge of the English language. Rosetta Stone allows a wide range of students at different grade levels and proficiency  skills to attain and complement their language skills at their own individual pace. Rosetta Stone is able to all 9th to 11th grade  students and for those 12th grtade students who require/need it. This year we will also expand this program to parents of  students as a tool to learn English in their own environment at their own pace.     ALEKS: Is an internet based program that allows ICHS to provide individually targeted math instruction correlated to the  Common Core and NYS standards. Implemented as a supplement to math instructional classes, ALEKS let the students  complement and validate their classroom learning using the program as a personal tutor in their home or classroom  environment. ICHS math teachers use the program in two main forms. As a supplement, to teach background topics that  students need to know in order to access the math classroom content and also as a tool to complement class instruction  thought personalized homework activities and tutorials. ALEKS is available for all ICHS students.    Khan Academy: Is an internet based program that offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71      dashboard that empower students to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. At ICHS we tackle math (from  Pre-Algebra to Advanced Math) and computer programming. Having an agreement with the DOE, the system is available for  free for all ICHS students.           13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   ICHS only offers an English as Second Language (ESL) program. Native language support is built into the INPS model.  Heterogeneous classes (mixed grade, skill level and languages) allow students to access content with native language support  from their peers. This practice is especially important in 9th and 10th grade and teachers not only allow this practice but also  encourage it, in order for students to access the material. Through this, students are encouraged to process content concepts  through native language and in English. In addition to this, all content classes have native language materials available, at  levels that correlate to NL literacy levels some math science and social studies text s are in different language versions.  Classroom paraprofessionals and some teachers are also bilingual. Each team has at least one bilingual staff member who can  also provide language support when needed.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   Our instructional teams meet regularly to ensure that required services and supports correspond to ELLs' age and grade  levels.  All of the required services for high school-aged ELLs are available to students. Core curriculum delivered corresponds  to grade and age levels, appropriately moving towards Consortium expectations and college readiness. Daily intervention  periods (totaling 240 minutes per week) afford the chance for students receive content-specific intervention services that  speak to the individual needs of students, and are not dependent on grade level.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    All students have equal access to bilingual texts, level-appropriate high interest texts, active boards and computers in all  classes, manipulatives and in some classes, additional bilingual adults as resources. Technology (active boards and computers)  are used to improve technology literacy, convey complex concepts through visuals and interactive activities and appeal to  multiple learning modalities. All ELA classes have books from different reading levels and also have books in different  languages to promote the reading skills of the ELLs. Math, science and social studies teachers, have reference texts that are  also available in different language versions. All classrooms have a set of bilingual dictionaries from different languages and a  computer cart with laptops available for each student.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   The majority of our incoming 9th grade students are over-the-counter enrollments and thus not necessarily on the school  roster before the beginning on the school year.  Students enrolled during the spring (those transitioning from a US middle  school) are encouraged to attend orientation programs offered monthly between February and June. Students enrolled prior  to the beginning of the school year are also encouraged to enroll in the CUNY Summer Intensive English Program or ICHS  summer literacy programs.          17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    A beginner's French language after school program is being offered to native and non-native French speakers. This program is  sponsored by the French Heritage Program funded by the French Embassy. The program also includes several trips and media  projects. As always, native language support is provided in every elective, after school activity as in the regular courses.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   NA       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  1. To enable teachers to constantly monitor student progress and adjust their instruction accordingly professional  development happens in a variety of ways, encouraging vertical and horizontal alignment and continuing development of  second language acquisition, literacy and numeracy instructional skills amongst all teachers. This continued refinement of  professional skills is creating a strong professional team who are able to provide a variety of in-class supports for SIFE. With  this focus in mind, professional development occurs at the following levels during the school year: team, department,  department heads, interdisciplinary, staff-wide, and administrative.   Staff shares curriculum and resources to improve student achievement and access to content. All teachers attend a week long  in-school professional development prior to the beginning of the school year. Additionally, all teachers are invited to attend a 2  day PD at the International Networks for Public Schools. During these workshops, teachers review ESL strategies, discuss  curriculum, and share best practices.  All staff also have the opportunity to participate in professional development courses offered by outside organizations such as  QTEL and through NYCDOE (teachers, paraprofessionals, support staff and administrative personal).        All the INPS PD courses are Common Core oriented and they are mainly focused on developing techniques that help teachers  to instruct and support ELL's. All new teachers have the opportunity to assist this PD days before the beginning of the school  year and during the school year they are also supported by have updates and retraining on these techniques. These courses  are taught by INPS mentors or by experienced teachers that work on a similar international environment.      Additionally staff are trained to assist students as they transition to high school from middle school. During the professional  development prior to the start of the school year, the school Guidance Counselors review strategies and techniques to assist  students with their transition. All staff are trained on using the Pre-Referral Intervention Manual, which provides strategies all  staff members can use to address academic or emotional needs. Instructional methods are developed and discussed during  weekly meetings lead by the guidance staff.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Teachers attend a 5 day, 6 hr per day professional development prior to the start of the school year. Additionally, teachers are  invited and encouraged to attend a 2 day workshop held by the Internationals Network for Public School. Teachers continue to  attend workshops throughout the year that are relevant to their content area or to further their pedagogy. Records of this  activities (Pd attendance list or table of contents of the PD session), are held by our school secretary who is in charge of  provide any per session if it applies. During the a 2 day workshop held by the Internationals Network for Public School,  guidance counselors also attend specific workshops prepared for them in order to assist ELLs with their transition.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73            Apart from the two full day PD at the International Networks for Public Schools that all  teachers assist, during the school year  professional development (always focused on the needs of ELLs) happens in the following ways for all teachers:  • 120 minutes per week within teaching teams, focused on interdisciplinary instructional strategies and social and emotional  supports (all teachers and paraprofessionals)  • 60 minutes per week within departments (all teachers)  • 60 minutes per week with various topics of focus (driven by pedagogic and administrative needs), once a month specifically  pertaining to literacy development for ELLs (all content area and ESL teachers, ESL Coordinator and paraprofessionals)  • 60 minutes per month (minimum) of inter-visitations/observations at team or department level (all teachers)  • 60 minutes per week with team teacher leaders focusing on interdisciplinary instructional strategies (1 teacher per teaching  team, assistant principal, guidance counselors and key administrative staff)  • 45 minutes per week regarding school wide leadership strategy and logistics (Assistant Principal and key administrative staff)  • 120 minutes per month for content specific strategy and logistics (department heads, assistant principal and key  administrative staff)  • 45 minutes per week for support staff strategy and logistics (assistant Principal and support staff)     During all these meetings attendance is taken and also there is an agenda that is filled with the information that has been  discussed and agreed during the meeting. This agenda is electronically shared with all teachers from the team/departments  and is also send to be stored on a binder available at the administrative office.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents are involved in multiple aspects of the school. In addition to ICHS' open-door policy, monthly Family Workshops are  held on Saturdays. We use staff translators that are present to interpret information for families as needed. The ESL  Coordinator translates the information to Spanish and the Parent Coordinator translates it to French. We have and ESL teacher  who is able to translate to Bengali and a paraprofessional who is able to translate to Arabic. Phone calls and fliers in multiple  languages are used to notify parents of meetings. Four timer per year, parent-teacher meetings are held. Student rubrics are  translated into their native languages and DOE and staff translators are on site to assist with any conversations. Parental  involvement in the school is high, with a average of 70 families attending the monthly workshops and around 250 family drop- ins since September 2016.  Parents are also present during student portfolio presentations and make classroom visits.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Berena Cabarcas, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.

Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      International Community High School takes the responsibility of providing each parent with written translation and  oral interpretation services extremely seriously. Every effort is made to ensure that parents whose primary language  is a covered language and who require language assistance services with written notification of their rights regarding  translation and interpretation services in the appropriate covered receive those services as well as instructions on  how to obtain such services.    -When a parent enters the school they are greeted by a parent welcome poster conspicuously posted outside the  main office.    -When a parent enters the main office a language ID guide is clearly posted at the security desk as well as in the main  office.    -At the enrollment interview, new parents are provided with the Parents' Guide to Language Access. Copies of the  guide are also distributed to parents at the four parent conferences throughout the school year. In addition, copies of  the guide are posted in the main office where translations are made available as needed.    -Notification to our parents is made in a variety of ways. Our parent coordinator provides monthly newsletters in all  the covered languages as well as in a variety of primary languages providing notification of their rights. This  information is also provided to parents at several points throughout the year. Translators are provided at each of  these meetings. The information is also provided to parents through our telephone messenger system which sends  out the messages in a variety of languages. Parents are also informed of the translation and translation services at all  four parent teacher conferences held in September, November, March and May.    • The information is to be posted in a conspicuous location near the primary entrance to the high school in the  covered languages. This notification indicates that a copy of the written notification of the parent’s Bill of Rights  regarding language assistance services and translation services are available from the Parent Coordinator in the main  office, room 126.    • International Community High School’s safety plan will contain procedures in order to ensure that parents in need of  language assistance services are not prevented from reaching the school’s administrative offices solely due to  language barriers.    • “Each school at which the parents of more than 10% of the children at such school speak a primary language that is  neither English nor a covered language shall obtain from the Translation and interpretation Unit a translation into  such language of the signage and forms required pursuant to this section and shall post and provide such forms in  accordance with this section.” At International Community High School the only languages spoken by over 10% of the  students are covered languages. (Spanish and French).    • International Community High School will provide information in each of the covered languages concerning the  rights of parents to translation and interpretation services and how to access such services on its school website.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81         In order to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services the school will assess the answers  parents provide in the school survey about whether or not the school is communicating with the parent in their native  language. Parents who attend monthly PTA meeting will be asked to provide feedback on how well the school is  providing parents with both written and oral translation services. In addition, whenever our parent coordinator  communicates with parents, he will request feedback on ways to improve communication and availability of  translation services.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          82
