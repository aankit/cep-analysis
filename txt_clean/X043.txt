This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At P.S. 43, our vision is to create a supportive educational and emotionally intelligent environment that is conducive  to a school community of learners where all members, inclusive of students, staff, parents and community  organizations, become engaged in the educational process. This community of learners will develop important  decision-making, critical thinking and technological skills, as well as skills that will enable them to communicate and  thrive in the 21 st century. Furthermore, our school community members will be active, responsible, contributing  members of society who will share accountability for achieving successful student outcomes.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P.S. 43 is located in District 7 of the New York City Department of Education. 97% of students qualify for free or  reduced lunch. The 3K through 5th grade school serves a population of approximately 451 students from culturally  diverse backgrounds. The neighboring community is home to many new immigrants from Mexico, Central America,  and Africa. According to the most recent data, 71% of our population is Hispanic, 27% of our population is Black and  less than 2% is Native American/Asian and White.    This past year with the support from United Way, the following support and services were provided in our early  childhood grades. Our third grade students participated in an Expanded Day program where their school day ended at  5:45 pm daily. This allowed students to receive additional direct instruction from classroom teachers as well as  enrichment activities and homework help. In addition, a consultant from Teaching Matters supported teachers in  grades K-3 in literacy. The United Way Expanded Day program may continue the second half of the school year, but is  contingent upon funding. In addition, we will have the support of a Universal Literacy Coach five days per week in  grades K-2.      As a result of this support, more students ended the year meeting grade level benchmarks than in previous years.  Students in grade 1 also attended Once Upon a Summer - a summer school program to ensure as little summer loss as  possible.      Our teachers are fully licensed and permanently assigned to our school. We have a social worker/guidance counselor  and a School Based Support Team (SBST) to respond to crisis intervention situations; to address discipline problems;  to engage in proactive counseling with students; and to refer parents to community agencies for additional support.  Due to our ongoing commitment to our students we have adopted a school-wide program to address their social,  emotional intelligence needs by utilizing a Positive Behavior Intervention Strategies (PBIS) program as well as other  programs such as Brain Power. We have adopted ‘Oliver the Owl’ as our mascot and students recite out “PS 43 Owls  have Big Eyes” pledge daily as well as our “Hoot” salute!   Our school has collaborations and strong partnerships with outside organizations such as the United Way and the  Chris Canty Foundation, PRIME Leaders (through Inwood House), the Anne Frank Center, Lehman College, City College  of New York, Food Bank of NYC, CARE for Teachers NYC, New Teacher Center, Brain Power Education, Teaching  Matters and Grow NYC provide a myriad of services to students as well as to teachers to ensure the academic and  emotional well-being of all.   We are especially proud of the work our New Teacher Center mentors have done throughout the year supporting the  teachers in our building with less than 3 years of experience. The mentors developed professional, trusting  relationships with these teachers and helped them problem solve the myriad of situations and, or scenarios that many  new teachers encounter, all while encouraging them to become self-reflective problem solvers on on their own. Next  year, we look forward to continuing the growth of this program.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Another highlight of this past year was the continuation of teacher inter-visitations. Initially, teachers who  participated in inter-visitations did so on a volunteer basis. The volunteering teachers were allowed to select the  subject of the lesson, the content of the lesson and the Danielson Component being observed during the inter- visitation. For the purposes of our inter-visitations the components our teachers focused on were 3b - Questioning  and Discussion Techniques, 3c - Student Engagement, and 3d - Using Assessment in Instruction. Visiting teachers took  low-inference notes focusing on the component selected then debriefed by sharing their notes and comparing them  to the examples and attributes of the specified component. The group then share their findings with the teacher by  providing them with 5 highlights as well as one reflective question designed to promote teacher growth. After our  initial introduction last year more teachers chose to participate in inter-visitations this year. In our third year we hope  to have virtually all teachers participate in the inter-visitation process.         We have student teachers from several colleges/universities who learn with us and are then hired to replace retired  teachers and teachers on leave. We also maintain a culture of respect, mutual trust and positive attitude that  supports academic and personal growth of students and adults. In addition, we have formed strong partnerships with  various organizations to support our students., for example, United Way which provided an extended day program for  our third grade students as well as Early Teaching Matters.      Some of the challenges we are facing include: Students on or above grade level are moving to Charter schools, new  admits replacing them are functioning 1.5-2.5 years below grade level expectations, over-aged students, and low  student achievement on New York State exams.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Approximately 26% of our population is Students with Special Needs. Students with IEPs receive the full continuum of  services including Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETTS), Collaborative Team Teaching (CTT); instruction  in self-contained class, and related services such as speech and language, counseling and occupational and physical  therapy. This year we have students in flexible programming for grades 1, 2 and 3 as well as an Inclusion Program in  collaboration with PS 17 in grades 4 & 5.       Additionally, 16% of the students are English Language Learners (ELLs) with Spanish as the predominant language. At  P.S. 43 there is a free-standing ENL (English as a New Language) program for grades K-5, which serves ELLs using a  push-in and pull-out model. Our Academic Intervention Service (AIS) providers help to reduce student-teacher ratios  during the literacy blocks. We are focused on improving student achievement for all students in all subgroups and  categories, and we strive to implement the standards based curriculum effectively.          4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Area of Strength:   Collaborative Teachers - At P.S. 43 staff members work well together and communicate high expectations throughout  the school community. Last year the instructional coach worked with teachers to rethink the way they were teaching  mathematics. Together, they created a new scope and sequence that focused on a standards based approach to  teaching as opposed to just following a curriculum. Using this approach teachers began to put an emphasis on   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      covering all major, supporting and power standards and strategically taught concepts in order to best prepare their  students. Teachers also collaborated to create resources for math and literacy centers.       Supportive Environment - The social-emotional well-being of all students is also at the core of our school-wide beliefs  on educating the whole child and as a result the staff know their students well and care about them. In order to  promote our supportive environment throughout the school we have begun instituting morning meetings in every  classroom throughout the school. During this time the teacher works with students to establish a community and  culture for learning. Students participate in one of a variety of group activities that focus on meditation, mindfulness,  etc. These activities are strategically selected to help students create a mental toolbox of sorts for times when they  might need to relax or self-regulate throughout the day.      Rigorous Instruction - Based on informal and formal observations, teacher practice improved from  ineffective/developing to developing/effective in the areas of questioning and discussion techniques (Danielson 3b)  and Using Assessment in Instruction (Danielson 3D). This was an area of growth for the previous year as well.  Teachers will continue using more open-ended questions designed to promote student thinking and understanding,  inviting students to think and offer multiple possible answers, giving adequate wait time for students to respond to  questions asked by their teachers and/or peers, challenging students to justify their thinking and engaging most  students in discussions. Teachers will continue using formative assessment strategies in order to monitor student  learning, establishing assessment criteria, giving feedback to students and using effective ways to check for student  understanding.   It is our firm belief that because of our progress in these two elements of the Framework for Great Schools our  students are truly beginning to flourish. No more is this evident than through the lens of student achievement on this  past year's ELA and Math Test.   Some of our accomplishments include: a significant increase in student progress in core curriculum areas, including  the NYC and NYS exams.    ELA (Grades 3-5)   2015 - 14.2% of students met proficiency    2016 - 25.2% of students met proficiency   2017 - 26% of students met proficiency.    2018 - 42% of students met proficiency (28% increase over the last 4 years)   Math (Grades 3-5)   2015 - 23% of students met proficiency   2016 - 29.% of students met proficiency   2017 - 30% of students met proficiency   2018 - 38% of students met proficiency (15% increase over the last 4 years)   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      Areas for Focus:   Strong Family - Community Ties - This year we would really like to continue building more bridges of communication  with parents, families and the community. One way we are planning to do this is through the use of our new school  website.    https://ps043x.echalksites.com/   Collaborative Teachers - Even though this was considered one of our strengths from the previous year we are going  to take the momentum we got from redesigning the math scope and sequence and translate it to English Language  Arts.   Rigorous Instruction - Regardless of the growth we have made over the past 4 years we still need to improve in the  area of rigorous instruction and we believe one way we can accomplish this is by providing our students with more  rigorous tasks aligned to the standards.                       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 07X043   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   471   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Within our mathematics curriculum we want to continue to promote the idea that mathematics is about inquiry,  visual ideas, communication and connections. This perspective embraces the instructional shifts as well as the  demands of the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS). In looking at our school's most recent New York State test  scores in mathematics we found that only 38% of our students were proficient. Additionally, our school’s recent PPO  and Quality Review visits revealed that we need to improve in the area of rigorous instruction and we believe one way  we can accomplish this is by providing our students with more rigorous tasks aligned to the standards.       Strengths:     A new Scope and Sequence that focuses on standards rather than a store bought curriculum    A new framework for math instruction that focuses on problem solving and strategic standards based   instruction      Needs:   Increased rigor in mathematics instruction        Develop problem solving skills and critical thinking skills (Grades K-5)    To improve the number of students attaining proficient levels on the NYS Mathematics Assessment (Grades3-  5)   Students in the lower grades will understand what it means to “do math,” while also laying a stronger foundation for  proficiency in the upper grades. In grades K-5 time will be dedicated during each math block for problem solving  during the "Problem of the Week" component of the math block. In addition, the use of Exemplars tasks will provide  teachers with student work products to analyze and discuss. Exemplars tasks are designed to be used as formative  assessments and afford teachers the opportunity to teach math content, build students’ repertoires of strategies and  check for understanding. The Exemplars rubric focuses on critical thinking, use of mathematical language and  symbols, representing one’s thinking and making connections across mathematical content areas. The rubric’s criteria  are consistent across the grade levels which adds to the coherence of our mathematics curriculum K-5.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

We will use Math Exemplars (Evidence based instructional  program) tasks, aligned to the Common Core Standards accessed  through an on-line library of differentiated tasks, to build  conceptual understanding and incorporate the Standards for  Mathematical Practice. In past years teachers have received PD  on how to utilize this program. Any new teachers will be given  the PD.   Teachers in grades K-5 will regularly use tasks from the  Exemplars program to increase the rigor of their instruction as  well as the students' ability to use mathematical vocabulary.  Teachers will also use an Exemplars task to assess all major  cluster standards and power standards. The Exemplars tasks will  be graded using the Exemplars rubric.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Based on the drop in our student attendance this past year we need to ensure that students come to school  consistently and on time so that they are not missing instruction. In the 2016-2017 school year the overall attendance  was 91.3% and this past year (2017-2018) the rate fell to 90.3%. We believe that the students' academic successes are  directly correlated to a supportive school environment and we know that students who want to come to school and  do so consistently, improve their academic skills.      Strengths:     Each classroom hold morning meetings each day to establish routine and culture.    Our school uses PBIS strategies to enforce positive behaviors in addition to incorporating strategies from   Brain Power in each classroom's "Chill Zone".  Students are taught how to use Brain Power activities to help them self-regulate.         Priority Needs:   Increase student attendance rate.       Empower student leaders.      To provide students with instruction that does not frustrate them and causes inappropriate behavior.    Enlist parents' support to ensure students are in school on time every day.   Increase positive/encouraging comments to students.      In addition, given the challenge of supporting our students' social and emotional needs, we want to extend this  support beyond the physical borders of our school by inviting the parents to fully participate in their children’s  education and achievement. We want our parents to know that there is tremendous value in educating the whole  child, and we plan to hold workshops throughout the year to share our work and to support their child’s success.

During the last few years teachers have effectively used PLC time to analyze student work and prepare for future  instruction as well as work in partnership to research teacher selected projects. This time has proved to be extremely  beneficial to all involved and has directly benefited students as a result. In fact, according to the 2017-2018 School  Quality guide 98% of teachers say that they had opportunities to work productively with colleagues at their school on  professional development. Within this same report though, under the School Leadership section, only 70% of teachers  say that they have influence over the development of instructional materials(Component Q12d of the School Survey).  As a result, this year PLC time will be spent designing and creating instructional materials.      Strengths:     Routines are already established for teachers to collaborate during PLC time.    Teachers understand the benefit of working together and sharing best practices    A new math scope and sequence has been created that focuses on teaching the standards not a store-bought   curriculum     A new math workshop framework has been designed to incorporate more student work time (Problem   Solving, Center time)      Priority Needs:     Assessments resources aligned to the common core standards    Center resources aligned to the common core standards        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

Staff members at P.S. 43 maintain a clear and cohesive vision of aims and best practices. Based on our 2017-2018  Quality Review, school leaders consistently communicated high expectations to teachers and provided the support to  achieve those expectations. In an effort to establish consistency the administrative team will continue to provide  teachers the opportunity to engage in collaborative meetings to focus on best practices that will improve learning and  social development for all students. According to our Quality Review and PPO, there is inconsistent application of  teaching strategies to provide multiple entry points to the curriculum. The impact on student engagement was  uneven, and not all students were demonstrating higher order thinking skills.   Upon reflection of the Quality Review, PPO feedback school leaders recognize the need to revisit the feedback that  was provided to the teachers on their instructional practices during the literacy and writing block. As an  administrative team, there is a need to ensure consistency in type, amount and quality of feedback provided to  teachers following observations that all teachers receive a variety of strategies that are specific to their needs.

For the past three years, our teachers began collecting data over 4 instructional periods throughout the year. The data  was then submitted to school administrators, and they then shared it with the superintendent. This year we would  like to make this data even more accessible to parents so that they are up to date with how their students are doing  throughout the year.    According to our 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, our school received a 93% score on the Outreach to Parents  component, which is on average with other schools in our district and the city. According to the same report our  school received a score of 87% percent in the Parent Involvement in School component. More specifically, 89% of  families said that they are likely to attend school meetings or school events. Although we positively outreach to  parents, and the families we serve are expressing interest in attending school functions such as workshops the  attendance at these meetings doesn't always reflect these numbers. As a result, next year our focus will be to  improve parent attendance at all school functions. In doing so, parents will become more aware of how their children  are doing and they will show their children that they are invested in their education.   Strengths:      Teachers are collecting student data and using it for assessment measures    Teachers are submitting data using an excel template shared via One Drive    There are 4 instructional periods in place and pacing calendars for each content area    Teachers share students' progress with parents using report cards and progress reports.    Newsletters and calendars given out each month    A school website has been created to share information with parents and provide them with helpful   resources.     Teachers welcome parents into their classrooms and schedule meetings with parent during Parent   Engagement time every Tuesday.      Needs:      Sharing this information with parents to help them understand how data is being used as well as how best  they can support their child's learning.     Encouraging more parents to attend all school functions, instead of only when report cards are being issued.

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   Parents will be invited to school events such as assemblies,  parent meets, parent workshops, etc. by sending fliers home and  providing parents with a reminder using the Phone Master.  Examples of workshops include: Brain Power Strategies, Move To  Improve - Activities To Do with your Child/ren, Cookshop,  Healthy Bucks, How to become a Volunteer, Be a Buddy not a  Bully, Trip to our local Library, Safety, How to Succeed in School.  Notice of all events will also be found on the calendar on our  school website.      The first Tuesday of every month teachers will host an open  house in their classrooms allowing parents to walk through their  child's classroom and examine their data binder. At this time,  parents will be encouraged to make an appointment with the  classroom teacher on one of the remaining Tuesdays during  parent engagement time.   Time will be built into a teacher's schedule every month to work  with their students to update their binders. Students will review  and reflect on the data in their binder and will be able to speak  to the work in their binder.   The school calendar, fliers, school website as well as monthly  newsletters, which are both translated into Spanish, will serve as  a way to communicate with parents and give them information  regarding this new procedure.

Preschool children from early childhood centers are invited to come visit our pre-K classrooms in June. They are given  a tour of the school and exposed to our curriculum, rules, procedure and school culture.   We participate in a District-wide kindergarten fair where we share our vision, resources and activities with pre-K  families. School Leaders and our Parent Coordinator attend PD sessions with the early childhood programs to ensure  that our curriculum is aligned. The Parent Coordinator ensures that all records are received in a timely manner. School  leaders review records to ensure students are provided with the appropriate intervention services.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     A committee was formed consisting of school leaders and teachers. The committee participated in professional  development, discussed guidelines for the selection of appropriate multiple assessment measures and what would be  appropriate for our staff and students. Teachers received professional development from our data specialist on how  to use the assessment results to improve instruction. Teachers will participate in data talks with school leaders to  review student progress on an 8-week cycle. The committee and teacher teams meet periodically to review data and  make adjustments to the curriculum.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 43, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       P.S. 43 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

These were the findings:     *  The Expanding students are having difficulty with providing relevant and meaningful details  to enhance their writing.  They require more conceptual/academic language.  Increased content  vocabulary and grammar development to advance their reading and writing skills are vital.     *  The Transitioning  students demonstrated difficulty with reading comprehension in regards to  fiction and non-fiction passages.  They need scaffolding in content vocabulary.  These students  also demonstrated difficulty with their writing skills.  Increased exposure to the writing process  and the proper sequencing in English are required.       *  The Entering and Emerging students need more reading readiness.  They need to acquire the  correct sounds of English. In addition, these students need support in developing writing skills  and vocabulary.     *  The Commanding ELL students (two years or less) need additional support in ELA test taking  practices.     Title III funding will be used to implement the Saturday Academy Program.  The classes will be  composed of ELL students from grades 3-5.  This program will also be offered to Commanding  students  - students who scored at the Commanding level within the last two  years.  Approximately 50 students will participate in the program.  A total of 4 teachers will  service the program: 1 of whom is a certified ESL teacher and the other 3 are content area  teachers with a common branch license.  The ratio of students to teacher per class will be  16:1.  The program will run for 10 weeks from 8:45am - 12:30 pm; breakfast and lunch will be  provided to the students.  Activities will include 60 minutes of direct instruction in English  language development taught by a certified ESL teacher.  The main focus of the program is to  provide additional academic support in literacy addressing the specific needs of the ELL students  as per the data obtained from assessments, as indicated above.  Students will be grouped  according to their needs and current functional abilities.  Students will participate in meaningful  and motivating activities that are relevant to their interest and life experiences.  The teachers will  provide a context that will motivate students to engage in natural communication giving them the  opportunity to express their ideas and feelings.  Reading buddies will be a component of the  program.  This will give the students the opportunity to develop their reading, writing, speaking  and listening skills as they read their stories to each other in this partnership.  To implement the  aforementioned findings, students will be engaged in writing activities that include academic  vocabulary, using a variety of graphic organizers, and non fiction resources will be used as   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   instructional aids, in addition to the resources purchased from vendors.  The materials we will  use are: IReady, Rally and Buckle Down.       In classes taught by teachers holding common branch/content area certification, students will  receive their language development period of instruction (60 minutes) from one of the ESL  teachers through the use of technology using the Imagine Learning English Literacy Computer  Program.  ELL students will use the "Imagine Learning" literacy computer program.  This  program develops reading skills through vocabulary, word attack, and comprehension skills.  All  classrooms have computers and students utilize websites, such as starfall.com and Brainpop.com  to develop reading skills, vocabulary, grammar, and reading fluency.  Each  classroom has a  SMART board which is used consistently.  Teachers use various programs installed in the  SMART board to provide differentiated instruction.  Teachers have 5 laptops and 5 Ipads each in  their classroom for student use.  In addition, they may borrow laptops from  laptop carts.  There  is one cart assigned to one classroom on each floor for teachers to borrow for student  use.  Teachers also borrow iPADs every day from the Computer room or UFT Teacher  Center.  Many applications are available on these iPADs to teach the alphabet, phonics, basic  sight words, grammar, reading and math skills.  The hands-on learning opportunities provided by  the technology present in each classroom assists the language development of the ELLs.  To support the facilitation of the co-teaching between the common branch and ENL teachers,  while students are at lunch  (12:00pm - 12:30pm), teachers will engage in a common planning  period each Saturday.  This will help to foster a more collaborative co-teaching experience for  the common branch and ENL teachers.  In addition, teachers will have the flexibility, depending  on the needs of the students, to implement either a one group model where each teacher works  together to direct a whole class of students with both working collaboratively or a multiple group  model where each teacher is facilitating and monitoring groups based on the needs of the  students.  Below is the proposed schedule for each ao-teaching group:            Common Branch Teacher 1 - ENL Teacher      8:50am - 9:50am            Common Branch Teacher 2 - ENL Teacher     9:55am - 10:55 am            Common Branch Teacher 3 - ENL Teacher     11:00 am - 12:00 pm                       Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:                   At no cost to Title III, our school implements weekly Professional Learning time every Monday  from 2:40pm to 3:55pm.

The ESL teacher,  will present a 3 part series of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56            Part C: Professional Development   workshops during these periods.    "Fundamentals of Second Language Acquisition. BICS/CALP  :Overview of Concepts." will be the first part and will provide a description of what Basic  Interperson Communication Skills and Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency actually is  and how long it takes to achieve. Focus will be on the cognitive demands of learning CALP  (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency).  The second Professional Development will target  second language acquisition.  A brief description of each will be offered (preproduction, early  production, speech emergence, intermediate fluency, and advanced fluency), with suggested  instructional activities given.  The third Professional Development will target "Basic Classroom  Techniques" to use with ELLs in the classroom.  Examples of best practices will be provided,  including verbal scaffolding (think alound, paraphrasing), procedural scaffolding (grouping  techniques, explicit teaching, modeling,practicing applying, and pairing and grouping of  students), and Instruction Scaffolding, which are tools that support learning.  For example, using  graphic organizers, using visuals and imagery and using manipulatives.During this time,  successful ESL strategies will be analyzed and modeled for staff servicing the ELL  population.  By providing professional development opportunities during the aformentioned  times, it allows us to use the funding more strategically to implement a host of activities for our  ELL students and their parents that will enrich their language acquisition experiences.       Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

The ability to draw in  and engage a parent in a child's academic life can be challenging due to time constraints.  With  targeted  and purposeful planning, we will reach out to all parents, but specifically those who are  parents of our ELL population, to equip parents with extending strategies to support ELL  learners at home.  Parents will be reminded with flyers and phone calls of the upcoming  workshop dates.  At no cost to Title III, a licensed ENL teacher will be presenting Professional Development  sessions to parents on various topics related to parent engagement and participation in their  child's academic and social/emotional learning.   All letters that are sent home with the students throughout the school year are sent home in  English and in the native language of the family.  The Parent Coordinator, calls parents on behalf  of many teachers who are monolingual in English to share information or make requests.  There  are many staff at P.S. 43 who are bilingual in English/Spanish who perform similar tasks.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  P.S. 43 uses the Fountas & Pinell benchmark system to assess the literacy skills of the ELL students in Kindergarten - 5th grade.  Fountas and Pinnell is a program used to evaluate the students' reading accuracy and comprehension.   Each child's   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      instructional level can be determined for guided reading according to the Fountas & Pinnell A-Z Text Level Gradient.  It is also  used to determine each child's independent reading level.  The classroom teacher maintains a reading record that reflects the  ability of the reader: by measuring reading accuracy, comprehension and fluency.  Good Habits, Great Readers by Celebration  Press Reading is used for literacy instruction. Material from EngageNY and ReadyGen are utilized to supplement our literacy  program. In addition, guided literacy is provided by the classroom teacher to students in small groups who are on the same  instructional reading level or that need support with a specific strategy.  Lessons progress across seven systems from level A  (beginning reading in Kindergarten) through level Z (represents competencies at the middle and secondary school level) on the  F&P Text Level Gradient.  Skills that are covered throughout levels A - Z include:  a combination of reading, writing, and  phonics/word study, emphasis on teaching comprehension strategies,  explicit attention to genre and to the features of fiction  and non-fiction books, explicit teaching of effective and efficient strategies for expanding vocabulary, and use of writing about  reading for the purpose of communicating and learning how to express ideas for a particular purpose and audience using a  variety of writing strategies.  When analyzing the F&P scores of the ELLs for the final marking period of the 2017-2018 school  year, it has been noted that the majority are not meeting benchmark. Approximately 7% of Kindergarten ELLs are meeting  benchmark, 21% are approaching benchmark, and 71% are below benchmark. Approximately 8% of ELLs in 1st grade are  meeting benchmark, 15% are approaching benchmark, and 77% are below benchmark. Approximately 12% of ELLs in 2nd  grade are above benchmark, 12% are meeting benchmark, 35% are approaching benchmark, and 41% are below benchmark..  Approximately 50% of 3rd grade ELLs are above benchmark, 10% are approaching benchmark, and 40% are below  benchmark. Approximately 36% of 4th grade ELLs are above benchmark, 9% are at benchmark, 9% is approaching benchmark,  and 45% are below benchmark.  Approximately 33% of 5th grade ELLs are above benchmark, 33% are at benchmark, and 33%  are below benchmark.   P.S. 43 has various programs to support the students at all grade levels.   Second grade classes have an  extended day until 5:30.  The students work on instruction with their teacher until 4:30 two days per week.    Selected 1st  graders from all classes receive Reading Rescue daily.  Students also attend the PRIME LEADERS Afterschool program.  The  second grade students participate in The United Way afterschool program, which is an extended day program. Teachers  provide additional instruction and students also receive support with homework from teacher assistants.  Students in grades 3- 5 receive AIS (Academic Intervention Services).    Selected students in grades 3, 4, and 5 identified in need of improvement  attend Wednesday and Thursday evening tutoring January to April.  We also have the Saturday Academy January to April for  select students identified in need of improvement in grades 3,4, and 5.         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    All students at P.S. 43 are assessed using Fountas and Pinnell reading assessment to determine if they have met pre- established benchmarks. The ELL students who are not meeting benchmarks are supported with AIS services.  In addition, ELLs  are given Writing Performance tasks and Fry word assessments to determine their development on the language modalities  throughout the year.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   P.S. 43 uses the NYC ELA Performance Tasks K-5 to assess all students at the beginning, middle, and end of the school year.  Those who score at the level 1 range receive AIS services, including ELLs. NYC ELA benchmark assessments in grades3-5 are  administered throughout the year, and students scoring at the level 1 range receive AIS services. New York State assessment  results for grades 4-5 are analyzed and those scoring at level 1 or a borderline 2 receive AIS services. Fountas and  Pinnell Running records for K-5 , literacy classwork and conferencing, performance based assessment in Good Habit Great  Readers and Good Habits Great Writers, and the Reading Rescue checklist are also utilized to evaluate student performance.  The results of the NYS Math CCLS exam 4-5 in grades are analyzed and students scoring at level 1 and borderline level 2 receive  AIS services. Math assessments are administered at the beginning, middle, and end of the school year.  The NYC ELA  Benchmark assessments in grades K-5 are also administered. Students scoring at a level 1 range receive AIS services. The  NYC Math Benchmark in grades 3-5 are administered in the Fall and Spring. Other assessments include the GO Math end-of- unit Exams and Math Examplars.  The success of the programs for ELL students are evaluated by examining the results of the  NYSESLAT, ELA and Math scores.  The main focus is on the NYSESLAT.  Students' scores are analyzed and compared to the  scores obtained the previous year.  For example, the results of the 2016 NYSESLAT would be compared to the results of the  2017  NYSESLAT scores.  This data is used to place students into appropriate groups according to proficiency levels and  needs.  This information can be used to determine if a student requires AIS (Academic Intervention Services) as he/she   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      demonstrates a score at the same level for two years in a row.  If a student decreases by 1 level (for example, Beginner to  Intermediate). he/she may require AIS, or this may be an indicator that the student has learning difficulties in this particular  area.  The student may be recommended to the RTI team for further evaluation.          6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Dr. Delucchi, the Principal, Ms. Feliu, the Assistant Principal in charge of Literacy and Curriculum, and Dr. Waye, the Assistant  Principal in charge of Discipline, Special Education Programs, and English as a New Language programs, meet and analyze the  data gathered throughout the year from the various assessments. Students who are at a level 1 or a borderline 2 receive  AIS (Academic Intervention Services). There are benchmark assessments, Good Habits Good Readers/ Good Habits Good  Writers end of Unit assessments, Math major cluster and power standard assessments  in addition to conferencing with  students conducted throughout the year to determine the progress to the students receiving intervention services.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Students are provided with increasingly intensive, targeted instruction designed to match their learning needs, as  demonstrated by performance on periodically administered assessments.  Screening assessments give clear indications of risks  in specific domains through set benchmarks or criteria by detailing how a child performs relative to peers of the same age or  grade level.  The ELL identification process identifies students eligible for services, but the NYSITELL also serves as an  assessment tool for all modalities.  For Spanish dominant students, the LAB-R is administered in the native language.  This is  also an assessment as it provides data regarding the student's skills in the native language and is an indicator as to how these  skills will transfer to the second language.  Students with a native language of Spanish and French in grades 1-5 are given an  informal written assessment in their native language and is assessed by teacher proficient in that language.  If the student does  not have grade level skills, he/she is provided with level 1 RTI  support within the classroom by the both the classroom and ENL  teacher.   P.S. 43 uses the Fountas & Pinnel for K-5 and the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade periodic Math and ELA benchmark  assessments to identify students that require intervention.  Teachers of all students in K-5 also use classroom and/or teacher  made assessments to monitor progress of students in literacy and math.  The benchmark for the F&P is conducted in the  fall.  Ms. Feliu, one of the assistant principals, collects the data from each grade, reviews it and meets with the teachers at  grade level meetings.  Students who are not on grade level and who are struggling are identified through data analysis and  teacher input.  Some ELLs, especially those who have had little response to RtI level 1, may require Academic Intervention  Services (AIS) or Reading Recovery.  Ms. Feliu and the classroom teacher maintain consistent feedback with Ms. Flanagan and  Ms. Baez, the ENL teachers, regarding the progress of ELL students who are struggling.  Supportive RTI strategies for ELLs are  shared and implemented. If the ELL student demonstrates minimal or no progress, he/she is recommended to the Child Study  Team.  At this point, AIS may be recommended.  Progress is monitored carefully by the AIS teacher and the classroom  teacher.  Formal and informal assessment is conducted daily and/or weekly.  This data is analyzed to determine if the student  continues to require the support, or require level 3 support.  The student may require Reading Recovery, or another 1:1  intervention.  Assessment is conducted daily and data gathered to track progress. At risk ELLs receive targeted instruction in  the classroom through the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher.  Key domains of literacy are developed to support  competencies in reading, writing, speaking, and listening.  Vocabulary, specifically Academic Language, is of utmost  importance.  Various strategies are used to promote oral language development: close, interactive reading aloud (frontload  vocabulary, ask open-ended questions, engage in discussion about the big idea of the text), storytelling with wordless books,  language frames for speaking and listening, and sentence transformations through guided dialogue.  Strategies for promoting  ELLs written language development include: model writing activities using the Language Experience Approach , interact with  students and have students interact with each other through written communications (i.e. dialogue journals), model language  structures when jointly writing texts (i.e. scripts for readers theatre), teach the writing process, integrate oral language and  vocabulary instruction into instruction by having students verbalize their thinking before putting it into writing and to use new  vocabulary and language structures in their writing. Word reading and writing activities are taught in interactive  ways.  Phonemic Awareness is taught as students sing songs, recite rhymes, read and reread poems and books with rhythmic  patterns.  Phonics instruction is also provided and sight words instructed.  Fluency is built by modeled fluent, expressive  reading, shared reading of big books, reader’s theater, partner reading, reading along with audio books, and recorded  reading.  Reading comprehension assists ELLs in building background knowledge.  Students read thematically related texts,  modified guided reading, reciprocal teaching, scaffold retelling and literature circles.  It is important to connect to ELLs Home   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         and Community Languages.  Strategies utilized to connect home to school include: storytelling about family and  neighborhoods, autobiographies and personal narratives, letters to family and friends, and research projects in the local  community.  Achievement is examined at the classroom.  How are the ELLs performing in comparison to their peers?  If several  ELLs are struggling, then the classroom teacher should focus on improving core instruction to target student needs.  The  proficiency level of all ELLs must be considered when planning all instruction.  If a student does not progress, then he/she may  need to be recommended for an evaluation for Special Education services.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The 2017 NYSESLAT data was analyzed and provided the following information regarding our students:  Of the 51 students who were administered the the test, 4 students scored on the Commanding level, 15 students  advanced 1 proficiency level, 1 student advanced 2 proficiency levels, 18 students remained at the same proficiency  level, and 5 students regressed 1 level. ENL Integrated and Stand Alone services target all four language modalities for  ELL students: listening, speaking, reading and writing skills.Upon analysis of the two tables "Number of Test Takers  and Modalities of Strength" and "Number of NYSESLAT Test Takers and Modalities of Need"for the  NYSESLAT, ENL  instruction will target the needs of the students as follows: 1st grade students will focus on writing and speaking skills,  2nd grade students will focus on reading, writing, and listening skills, 3rd grade students will focus on listening skills,  4th grade students will focus on listening , reading, and writing skills, and 5th grade students will focus on writing and  listening skills. Activities to address all skills are embedded into academic instruction. Classroom teachers are  informed of the modalities of strength and need for the ELLs in their classes so that they may plan instruction  accordingly. At present, based on the 2017 NYSITELL or 2017 NYSESLAT scores the Kindergarten students are at the  following levels: 40% of Kindergarten students are at the Entering proficiency level, 13.33% of students are at the  Emerging proficiency level, 20% of students are at the Transitioning level, and 26.67% are at the Expanding level.   Given the 14 ELLs who sat the 3rd Grade Math Test, 14% scored a 3, 36% scored a 2, and 50% scored a 1. Given the 13  students who took the New York State ELA test (1 student was exempt), 18% scored a 4, 46% scored a 2, and 46%  scored a 1. Given the 4 ELLs who took the 2017 4th Grade New York State ELA Test, 25% scored a 3, 50% scored a 2,  and 25% scored a 1. 25% of these 4th graders scored a 4 on the State Science Test, 25% scored a 2, and 50% scored 1.  Last years 5th graders, 12 in total, obtained the following results on the State Math Test: 17% scored a 4, 25% scored  a 3, 25% scored a 2, and 33% scored a 1. Three students were exempt from the ELA, so the following results are for  the 9 5th graders who took the State ELA Test: 11% scored 3, 22% scored 2, and 67% scored 1.  The NYSESLAT and NYSITELL scores are used to group students according to proficiency level and to create the ENL  schedule for students. These scores, in addition to the Math, ELA, and Science scores are used to plan instruction for  the Integrated and Stand Alone ENL program.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Information is shared with all teachers in order for adjustments to be made, and differentiated instruction provided to  students. ENL teachers are required to attend  ELL monthly liaison meetings focusing on ENL content and  compliances; this information is then turned key with other teachers in the school. Weekly professional development  meetings are organized to help distribute information, materials, and to clarify any questions concerning ELL  students. NYSESLAT and NYSITEL test scores are utilized to identify ELL proficiency levels, and help create student  groupings based on these scores. Academic Intervention Services (AIS) are services provided to students who scored a  level 1 or approaching a level 2 on various periodic assessments and classroom assessments. Data collected from  AIS is used to assess student mastery, and determine whether or not student is eligible to exit the program. After   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         which, teachers select new candidates for the program. ENL teachers meet frequently with classroom teacher to  share ENL learning strategies and techniques which help reinforce what students are learning in core classes.    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      The ELLs were all grouped into one classroom on each grade level to the greatest extent possible.  However, this  is difficult to plan and organize as the Kindergarten classes as the students were not yet all administered the NYSITELL.  Kindergarten Integrated services are provided as follows: 7 students receive services in K-108 on Monday for period 1  and 2, 6 of those students are brought to K-106 on Tuesday and Thursday during  Period 8 to receive services with 9  other ENL students already present in K-106, 9 students in K-106 receive ENL services on Wednesday and Friday  during Period 3 in their classroom.  Nine students receive Stand Alone services on Tuesday and Thursday during  Periods 6 & 7. These students are at the Entering and Emerging level. One student is at the Transitional level, and he  receives Integrated services in his class, K-108, on Monday only, for periods 1 and 2. He receives Stand Alone services  on Tuesday during 6 & 7.  The 1st grade ELL students are placed into two classrooms, with the vast majority in 1-216. Integrated services are  provided to nine 1st graders already in 1-216 on Monday and Wednesday, Period 6 and on Friday, Period 7 and  8.  Five students are brought into 1-216 from 1-214 on Friday for ENL Integrated services for Periods 7 and 8.  Four  (these students also receive Integrated services in 1-216 on Friday) students are brought to 1-216 for Integrated  services on Monday and Wednesday for Period 6 for ENL services. Eight 1st grade ELLs receive Stand Alone services in  room 213. Twelve  2nd grade students receive ENL Integrated services on Tuesday, Periods 1 and 2 in room 2-211.  Eleven of those students also receive ENL Integrated services on Thursday, Periods 1 and 2 in room 2-211. There are  other 2nd grade students that are brought to 2-211 to receive ENL Integrated services. One  student is removed from  2-104 and brought to 2-211 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, periods 1 and 2. Two other students in 2-104 are brought to  2-211 on Thursdays for periods 1 and 2 only.  One student is brought from 2-203 to 2-211 on Thursdays for periods 1  and 2 only. One student is brought from 2-103 to 2-211 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, periods 1 and 2. There is a 2nd  and 3rd grade combined Stand Alone group. There are nine 2nd grade students in this group. Five students receive  services on Monday and Wednesday, periods 7 and 8 in room 213. There are three students who receive Stand Alone  services on Monday, periods 1 and 2 only, and one who receives services on Wednesdays during periods 7 and 8 only  in room 213.  There are ten 3rd grade students who receive ENL Integrated services on Wednesday and Friday, periods 1 and 2.  There is one student brought from 1-101 to 3-206 on Fridays, periods 1 and 2 only. There are four 3rd grade students  who receive ENL Stand Alone services in room 213: two receive services on Mondays and Wednesdays during periods  7 and 8,  and two  students on Monday during periods 7 and 8.    Ms. Baez  provides  both Stand- alone and push-in ENL service to 4th and 5th grade English language learners. At  PS 43,  2 classes in grades 3 through 5, follow departmentalized instruction. Classes who follow departmentalized  instruction adhere to alternating weekly schedules in which on week A classes will be taught literacy in the morning,  and then taught Math in the afternoon. On the following week, Week B- students are taught Math in the beginning of  the day, and then are taught Math at the end of the day. Therefore, ENL teachers, on what is referred  to as week- A,  will push-into a literacy class for that week, and then push-into a math class on the following week, referred to as  week- B. On Mondays and Tuesdays, two students - one at the Expanding level and one at the entering level- receive  push- in ENL support for 1st and 2nd period in room 4-302. On Wednesdays and Thursdays,  for 1st and 2nd period,  one Entering 5th grade student from class 5-303 is pushed-into class 5-207 where three other students- Emerging,  Expanding, Commanding levels-  work together in heterogenous grouping of ELLs and non-ELLs. From  Monday through Thursday, during 4th period, Ms. Baez pushes into a self- contained, 12:1:1 special education class to  service two English language learners with I.E.Ps - who are at the Transitioning level, and at the Emerging level.  On  Wednesdays, for 7th and 8th period, 6 students - 2 Entering, 3 Emerging, and 1 Transitioning level- are pulled- out of  their classes for stand- alone ENL service, in classroom 213. On Fridays the same group of students  are pulled out for  1st and 2nd period.   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   There is no TBE program at P.S. 43 at present due to the fact that we do not yet have 15 parents of students with one  particular Home Language who chose TBE on the Parent Selection form in 2 consecutive grades. In the event that this occurs, a  TBE program will be opened for these students.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   There is no DL program at P.S. 43 at present due to the fact that we do not yet have 15 parents of students with one particular  Home Language who chose DL on the Parent Selection form in 2 consecutive grades. In the event that this occurs, a DL  program will be opened for these students.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?            Students at the Entering and Emerging level receive 360 minutes, or 2 units of study per week.  Of that time, I80 minutes,  or 1 unit, are Integrated ENL services and the remaining 180 minutes, or 1 unit, is Stand- Alone ENL.  Students at the  Transitional level receive 180 minutes of services per week.  The majority of students at the Transitional level receive 180  minutes  Integrated ENL services, but there are some who receive 90 minutes Integrated ENL and 90 minutes Stand-alone  services.  Students at the Expanding level receive 180 minutes, or 4 periods, of Integrated ENL services.Students at the  Commanding level receive 90 minutes Integrated services only. Both ENL teachers meet  once a month with the Data Specialist  to review the monthly ELL report  to ensure that all ELLs are receiving the appropriate services.         There is one 4th grade classroom teacher who is dually certified as a Special Education teacher and as an ENL teacher.  This  teacher, who co teaches an ITC class, provides the ENL Integrated services for the ELL students in her class. The ENL Integrated  and Stand Alone services for grades K through 3 are provided by Ms. Flanagan. The ENL Integrated and Stand Alone services for  grades 4 and 5 are provided by Ms. Baez.     Both ENL teachers confer with classroom teachers in person, by phone, through e-mail and by texting each other to plan  instruction. The delivery of Integrated services varies with each classroom teacher and subject. Ms. Baez co teaches with one  4th grade teacher for English Language Arts, as does Ms. Flanagan for the 2nd grade class.  Both teachers also provide guided reading instruction and small group strategy instruction during English Language Arts. Both  teachers also conduct writing lessons if this is the class activity. Both ENL teachers meet and/or communicate via phone or text  to discuss ENL techniques that would best support ENL students at all times. Math Integrated services are provided in the  same manner with the same level of planning. Both ENL teachers either work with a small group to deliver math instruction, or  they support the classroom teacher by providing the necessary vocabulary with visuals and/or by providing additional  modeling for students.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       Literacy instruction in our ENL groups is based on the same guiding principles of literacy instruction for our general education  classes. P.S. 43 will be using the Good Habits, Great Readers  curriculum, which is aligned to the Common Core Curriculum,  to  teach literacy skills. Material from ReadyGen and EngageNY will be used to supplement our literacy program.  Go Math is the  chosen math curriculum this year.  Engage NY and the use of Exemplars will also supplement the math program. P.S. 43 uses  the NYCDOE Passport Curriculum for Social Studies. The Harcourt Science curriculum, NYC edition, is used by both the  classroom teachers and the Science teacher. Students in grades 2-5 receive supplemental Science content in a separate  location within the school. The Science teacher, Ms. Regina, enhances and supports the curriculum with additional hands-on- activities, such as experiments, varied  texts, videos, and online resources. Classroom teachers use the Amplify curriculum. This   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      curriculum incorporates reading, digital instruction, with student created models of their learning . Differentiation is  incorporated throughout each lesson and unit. Technology is incorporated through inquiry-based learning and  research.  Teaching  strategies presented in the curriculum in context makes the comprehension process more concrete and  the text more accessible.  By teaching students the comprehension strategies and not just skills, students learn both the  content material and corresponding language and the academic language associated with each subject.  Prior knowledge and  building connections is used to scaffold instruction in various ways in our ENL groups.   To supplement usage of English,  particularly to enhance communication between students for clarification purposes we build vocabulary through authentic and  meaningful experiences with words and also the use of computer technology.   There is ongoing collaboration between the  ENL teacher, AIS teachers, and classroom teachers to align content area instruction.  The ENL teacher carefully plans with the  classroom teachers by meeting during Prep periods and by viewing the pacing map and curriculum map for the year.  This  helps to plan ENL Integrated and Stand-Alone services.  The ENL teacher obtained copies of all the class schedules to ensure  that content instruction would be provided even during ENL Stand-Alone services.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?       Students are administered the Math periodic assessments in Spanish. Arrangements are made at the beginning of the school  year to secure bilingual translators to administer the Math and Science test to students in grades 3-5 in the low incidence  languages (i.e. French).         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   Subgroups of ELLs  Our student population is diverse and complex; therefore, we have developed various plans to help meet  the identified needs of all of our ELL students.  Differentiated instruction is provided through the use the Literacy Based  Technology Program, called "Imagine Learning English."  The Computer teacher, Mr. Kalkau, sets up teachers and students in  grades K-5 with ST Math and iRead. Teachers schedule their class to enter the Computer Lab at least twice a week to use these  programs. All classrooms have desktops, laptops, and iPads to use these programs in the classroom.  We also have Razkids.com  and Reading A-Z.com for all teachers. Both ENL teachers also have the ELL program with Razkids.com to further support the  ELLs.The  SIFE (0)  students are provided with the following:  Academic Intervention Services (AIS) in both the native language  and in English, math push-in/pull-out groups, and the use of the "Imagine Learning English" program – a software program to  help with English language acquisition.  Services will be provided by ENL, and AIS teachers. Study plans for the SIFE students  will be based on NYSESLAT.Newcomers (zero to three years) [63 students] will be provided services as per the results of the  NYSITELL or the NYSESLAT: Entering and Emerging level students receive 180 minutes of Integrated services and 180 minutes  of ENL Stand Alone services, Transitional level students have an option to receive 180 minutes Integrated services, or 90  minutes Integrated services and 90 minutes ENL Stand Alone services, Expanding level students receive 180 minutes Integrated  services, Commanding level students receive 90 minutes of Integrated services only. Students participate in differentiated  instruction using the “Imagine Learning English” literacy computer program. The initial reading component of the program  develops early reading skill through vocabulary, word attack, comprehension skills. Students will be invited to participate in the  after school program and Saturday Academy to receive extra preparation for the ELA NYS exam.  Students also utilize websites,  such as www.starfall.com, and Brainpop.com to develop early reading skills, vocabulary, grammar, and reading fluency. All  classrooms have a SMART Board which is used consistently.  All teachers use various programs installed in the SMART Board to  provide differentiated instruction.  Newcomer students are placed according to their proficiency levels as per the NYSITELL or  the NYSESLAT.  The Entering, Emerging, and Transitional groups will work on developing speaking, listening, reading, and  writing skills. ELLs (four to six years) [5 students] Students will engage in frequent reading conferences with their teacher to  discuss progress, areas in need of improvement, and to set goals. In addition students participate in differentiated instruction  using the “Imagine Learning English” literacy computer technology program. Good Habits, Great Readers is the literacy  program used at P.S. 43 this year. This program is aligned to the Core Curriculum Standards. The program is described  as "a  core balanced literacy reading program." A more detailed description explains that " The Reading program supports literacy  learning through whole-group (Shared) and small-group (Guided) instruction. In Shared Reading lessons, teachers introduce  key reading strategies and skills in a whole-group setting and build a common way of talking about books. During Guided  Reading, teachers provide instruction targeted to specific developmental levels. The Writing program provides teachers with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      an opportunity to model for students the practices, skills, and strategies proficient writers use to express themselves and  communicate in a variety of genres.  Students engage with complex text and its academic language through the units of study  designed around the text at each level."   Additional support is provided through the use of various websites such as  Brainpop.com.  This website provides instruction on vocabulary, grammar, reading comprehension skills and test taking skills  through video presentations with follow up activities for the students to complete online.  This website also provides  instruction in subject areas such as Math, Social Studies, and Science.   All classroom teachers, AIS teachers and service  providers also use SMART boards for instruction.  Classroom teachers, AIS teachers and service providers also have laptops  available for student usage.  Some classrooms incorporate iPads into daily instruction. These programs and websites  adheres  to state NLA and ENL Standards.Long Term ELLs - will be provided with AIS specific to their language needs.  The vast  majority of our ELL population has developed speaking and listening abilities, so the focus will be on increasing Cognitive  Academic Language Proficiency (CALP) skills. Therefore, instruction will be content based, with language acquisition made  accessible to the students through sheltered English techniques. Additional support is provided through the use of  technology.  Students utilize website such as Brainpop.com which provides instruction on vocabulary, grammar, reading  comprehension skills and test taking skill through video presentations with follow up activities to be completed online.  The  website also provides instruction in subject areas such as Math, Social Studies, and Science.There are 4 ELLs in self contained  Special Education classrooms. Our special needs  students are mainstreamed with our ELLs in general education classes with  additional AIS support and are provided with one-to-one individualized instruction whenever possible with a focus on  communication strategies. Additional support is provided through the use of technology. Some students with disabilities are  placed in ICT (Integrated Co-Teaching) and self-contained classes.  Students use websites such as starfall.com to develop early  literacy skills.  Upper grade students use Brainpop.com to focus on vocabulary, grammar, and reading comprehension  skills.  All classroom teachers, AIS teachers, and program teachers/ service providers use the SMART Board to provide  differentiated instruction.  Some Special Education classrooms incorporate iPads into instruction.  All Special Education  classrooms have laptop carts and students use the laptops on a consistent basis.Students reaching Commanding/ Proficiency  level are provided with content based ENL instruction for 90 minutes a week for two years after passing the NYSESLAT.  In  addition, they have the opportunity to receive ENL instruction through our after school ELL program. Additional support is  provided through the use of technology.  The students  use various websites such as starfall.com, Brainpop.com, and  Razzkids.com. In the Razzkids ELL component, teachers are able to select differentiated lessons for students depending on  their  reading level and proficiency level.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   Teachers of ELL students with disabilities use a variety of strategies.  Technology is widely used.  All classroom teachers, AIS  teachers, program teachers and service providers utilize a SMART Board to differentiate instruction for this particular group.  All teachers use the "SMART Exchange Lesson Plans" program to create lessons to meet the needs of the students.  Technology  is also incorporated through the use of computer programs such as "Imagine Learning English", and websites such as  Starfall.com and Brainpop.com.  All Special Education classes are equipped with laptop carts and students consistently utilize  the laptops.  Others classes may borrow laptops.  Each class was assigned 5 laptops and mini iPads for student usage. In  addition, All classes borrow and incorporate iPads into daily instruction.  The use of technology provides visual aides, visual  cues, and visual modeling.  The SMART Board and the websites are interactive which gives a "hands on" learning  opportunity.  The website Brainpop.com provides instruction in subject areas such as Math, Science, Social Studies, and Music..  The students use the ST Math program and all ELLs and SWDs use the Imagine Learning program.  Scaffolding is provided  through a  multi-sensory approach. The students also use manipulatives (play dough, cubes, alphabet tiles) and visuals (word  walls, illustrations, modeling, peer modeling, graphic organizers).  Tasks, activities, and projects are differentiated according to  the needs of the students.The students are provided with one to one instruction when possible, and are usually instructed in  small groups to address specific skills.  The students also engage in frequent "partner work" where they work on an activity or  task with one other student.  Teachers allows ELL students with disabilities extra time to complete all activities and tasks.           9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67       P.S. 43 uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL students with disabilities  within the least restrictive environment in many ways.  The ELL students are grouped according to their appropriate level :  Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding.  While receiving ENL services, they are again placed in sub  groups according to their needs.   P.S. 43 also schedules a Literacy Block in grades K-5 each morning.  The teachers employ small group instruction, one to one  conferencing, small group conferencing, partner work, and literacy centers during this time.  There is a Child Study Team at P.S.  43 that meets once a week to focus on the needs of students who appear to have learning difficulties.  Classroom teachers  recommend such students to the team to develop a RTI (Response to Intervention) plan.  At risk interventions that are offered  immediately include AIS (Academic Intervention Services) in Math and Literacy.  There are seven AIS teachers in the  school.  There are three social workers available to provide at risk and mandated counseling services to the students.   A  bilingual social worker, also provides services and support to ELL students with disabilities in addition to providing support to  their families.  Other support services available to ELLs include occupational therapy and speech therapy.   The occupational  therapist, is present at the school five days a week. There are three speech therapists present in P.S. 43 one of which is a a  bilingual speech therapist who works with ELLs at the Entering and/or Emerging level.   The other two speech therapists, works  with students who are more proficient in English.  There is also a hearing teacher,  who works at P.S. 43 on a part-time  basis.  There is a SETSS teacher, who provides services to students in grades K-5 using a pull-out model.  Other Special  Education placements in P.S.43 includes:  ICT (Integrated Co Teaching) classes in grades Pre-K, K, 1,2,3, 4 and 5.   Classroom  teachers, AIS teachers, and all service providers meet consistently to evaluate and plan for the needs of the students.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Using the Data from the AMAO, ELA State Test Scores, ELA Teacher Assessments, ELA End-of-Unit Assessments,  Math State  Test Scores, Math End-of-Unit Assessments,  Writing Assessments, Science and Social Studies End-of-Unit  Assessments,  teachers employ small group instruction, one to one conferencing, small group conferencing, partner work, and  centers (when possible) throughout the day for low performing students .  Classroom and AIS teachers plan differentiated  instruction during grade level meetings.  There is a Child Study Team at PS 43 that meets once a week to focus on the needs of  students who appear to have learning difficulties.  Classroom teachers recommend these students to the team to develop an  RTI (Response to Intervention) plan.  At risk interventions that are offered immediately include AIS (Academic Intervention  Services) in all content areas.  The AIS teachers incorporate Science and Social Studies curriculum while teaching literacy skills  and reading strategies.  These services are provided in English using ENL strategies.  There is one social worker and one  guidance counselor available to provide at-risk and mandated counseling services to the students.  The school social worker  provides services and support to ELL students with disabilities and their families.  Other support services available to ELL  students with disabilities include occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech therapy.  There are three speech  therapists present at the school:   a bilingual speech teacher who works with ELLs at the Entering and/or Emerging level three  days a week,  the other speech teachers, work with ELLs who are more proficient in English.  There is also a hearing teacher,  who works at P.S. 43 on a part-time basis.  There is a SETSS teacher, who provides pull-out support to students who have an  IEP (Individualized Education Plan).  Other Special Education placements in PS 43 include ICT (Integrated Co Teaching) classes  in grades PreK - 5.  Classroom teachers, AIS teachers, and all service providers meet consistently to evaluate and plan for the  needs of the students.    The Kindergarten classes receive 4 hours a day, 16 hours a week of push in direct instruction with  students performing at the bottom third of the grade.  Students in grades 3, 4, and 5 receive AIS, PM tutoring two days a week  from January to April and students identified in need of improvement may attend the Saturday Academy from January to  April.  The AIS teachers provide services to address both ELA and Math skills.  The AIS teachers use grade level appropriate  materials to address the Science and Social Studies curriculum while teaching literacy skills. Unit tests are administered  routinely to assess knowledge of subjects covered.  Reading teaches who instruct on a 1:1 basis use various Science and Social  Studies leveled texts with the students to practice reading strategies.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  For the upcoming year, we are planning to integrate more technology through the use of smart boards, Imagine Learning, Raz- Kids, iRead and ST Math.   We plan to use Good Habits Good Readers, and incorporate  Ready Gen and Engage NY for literacy  instruction. In regard to the Math curriculum, we plan to use Go Math, Exemplars and Engage NY. Scaffolding will be utilized to  help  our ELLs access the curriculum.   The Saturday Academy ane the After-School tutoring programs programs are designed to provide academic support in  language development in all content areas.  When analyzing the F&P scores of the ELLs for the Fall 2017, it has been noted that   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68      the majority are not meeting benchmark. 100% of the ELLs in Kindergarten and 1st grade are not meeting benchmark.  55% of  he ELLs in 2nd grade are not meeting benchmark.  75% of the ELLs in 3rd graders are not meeting benchmark.  63%  4th grade  ELL students are not meeting benchmark, and 100% of the ELLs in 5th grade are not meeting benchmark.  Based on our data  patterns in the NYSITELL(2016-2017), we have noticed that our upper grade students tend to need more support in the reading  and writing areas of this test.  In the lower grades, we noticed that the students need help in language development. We  noticed that new students to the country have limited vocabulary and basic reading/writing skills.  We also noticed that on the  NYSITELL  test, students scored at the entering level but progressed to the emergent/transitioning levels later in the year.  The  programs above provide the appropriate skills the students need in order to develop language.  These skills include:  a  combination of reading, writing, and phonics/word study, emphasis on teaching comprehension strategies,  explicit attention  to genre and to the features of fiction and non fiction books, explicit teaching of effective and efficient strategies for expanding  vocabulary, and use of writing about reading for the purpose of communicating and learning how to express ideas for a  particular purpose and audience using a variety of writing strategies.               12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   The programs instituted for ELLs are planned to remain in place.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   The ELL students participate in the Music, Science, Writing, Gym, Computer programs.  These programs are built into their  schedule.  All ELLs are provided with the opportunity to participate in the after-school programs, and are encouraged to do so  by their teachers, Ms. Rodriguez (Parent Coordinator), and by administration.  The Education Through Music program incorporates many activities that are aligned to the Core Curriculum.  These activities  address the needs of the ELL students across all grade levels.  Students in Kindergarten and 1st grade learn symbols, patterns,  and tracking.  They also learn how to keep a steady beat with proper emphasis on the correct syllables. This assists in  promoting reading fluency. Students in 2nd grade are emerging readers in regard to music. This means that they learn to read  lyrics from music. Tracking is reinforced. Students follow a score with music and lyrics, which reinforces inference skills. 3rd  grade learns each letter note and to play an instrument. They must recognize symbols, such as "f" (forte), which means loud,  and "p" (piano), which means soft. Students continue to read music, follow patterns, and make inferences. 4th grade students  apply various strategies to read music.  They learn to progressively read challenging pieces of music, which leads to more  complex pattern recognition. For example, the students know when to repeat a piece of music within a major piece. 5th grade  students build upon what they learned in 4th grade. They must read more complex symbols with musical pieces that involve  repetition multiple times. Students in the school band must know each others parts in each piece of music.They must also  inference independently. For example, the music teacher, Ms. Prosini, may count measures to prompt the beginning of a  music piece or she may sing/hum the prompt. Either way, students must be able to determine when to start playing their  piece. The most important skills emphasized in music are listening skills, tracking (reading), following patterns, and inference  skills.   To maximize and increase English language proficiency ELL students are receiving additional support with a technology based  literacy program - "Imagine Learning English". (This program is available in the Computer room, in the classrooms with ELLs, in  the ENL classroom and on computers that can be signed out for the day for student use).  Students can also use  www.starfall.com and www. Brainpop.com both in school and at home.  These websites address content area and literacy  skills.  ELL students participate in the Title III Saturday Academy.  This program enhances ENL skills.  All four language  acquisition modalities are utilized. Reading and Writing skills are focused on for students in grades 3-5 in preparation for the  State Assessments.  All ELLs participate in the Community Based Organization Programs in our school.  All students are  involved in a nutrition program, which is ran by a representative from the Bronx Health Reach/NY CED Institute for Family  health.  The third grade teachers are trained to instruct the students about nutrition.  Teacher's guides and student materials  are provided.  A pre and post height and weight component is incorporated to evaluate how students have implemented  healthy choices at the end of the program.  The second graders participate in the "The Swim For Life Program."  Students  attend a community pool and receive swimming instruction once a week.   Students in grades K-5 maintain the Community  Garden. Teachers instruct students on how to grow vegetables and prepare healthy meals.  Various aspects of nutrition and  healthy choices are explored.  The upper grade students are involved in the "Anne Frank" project, which is an educational  program to teach literacy, acceptance, character building and emotional intelligence.  This is completed by the students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      reading "The Diary of Anne Frank" and focusing on her life and the significance of World War 2.  Students in grades PreK, some  2nd grade and some self-contained Special Education classes are involved in the "Cookshop" program.  Students learn about  healthy food choices and actually prepare meals to eat in the classroom with fresh ingredients.  The Gym teacher runs the  "Mighty Milers" programs, which provides instruction on physical fitness and health.  Classroom teachers use the "Move to  Improve" program throughout the school day.  Teachers incorporate short, structured activities into their classrooms.  These  activities integrate grade-level academic concepts and physical activity in a 10-minute educational lesson and are aligned to  the New York State Physical Education Learning Standards.  The school utilizes the "Activity Works" program throughout the  day.  This program integrates twelve minute exercise bursts with core curriculum in the classroom.  This can be performed  when students are low on energy or during transitions.  The program states "Scientifically developed, this plug-and-play  program is used to maximize academic performance, combat obesity and meet state mandates for physical education. PS 43  also uses the Power Brain Education program which encompasses exercises and songs to to boost focus, confidence, memory  creativity,and emotional wellness.  Teachers incorporate these exercises throughout the school day, and these exercises  become part of the daily routine. Select Fourth and Fifth grade students who show strong academic achievement and/or  model excellent leadership are invited to participate in "Project Boost."  Last year, the program began integrating special needs  students who are self-motivated and well disciplined.  The "Project Boost" program is designed to enhance students'  knowledge of New York City and provide exposure to the cultural arts.  Project Boost students work on community service  projects.  These projects allow students to apply the lessons learned in the classroom to real-life experiences.    This program  incorporates field trips throughout the school year (both during and after school hours) to various museums, plays/musicals to  provide a varied experience to the students. Activities aligned to the Core Curriculum are conducted during meetings before  the trips.  Students learn about citizenship by researching various organized charity groups.  Each year, the students select one  charity, such as "The Smile Train", and plan a school wide campaign to raise money.  Participants have presented movies  and/or slide shows regarding the chosen charity to the rest of the school.  Money is raised by selling buttons (student made) or  bracelets (with the charity name on it) during the lunch periods.  The final amount of money raised is presented to that charity  at a special event at the end of the school year.  The Early Reading Matters program is available to teachers and students in K- 2. A consultant,  works with classroom teachers to support literacy development through creating literacy centers and  modeling both guided reading instruction and whole group instruction (read aloud, etc.).     Native languages and cultures are evidenced throughout the school in a number of ways.  Classroom libraries, the school  library, and the teacher resource room all provide a large selection of books written or translated in Spanish.  Students are  serviced via the push-in and pull-out models where the ENL and Spanish NLA teachers collaborate with the content area  teachers to infuse ENL methodology and strategies in lessons throughout the content areas.  In the pull-out NLA class students  receive individualized support in their native language focusing on student’s needs.  Students are provided with supplementary  materials (spanish dictionaries, spanish text, novels) in their native language when necessary.  The Native Language Arts  teacher uses the "Modern Curriculum Press Little Book Collection", National Geographic Big Books in Spanish, and a leveled  Spanish library (Rigby collection).  The Native Language Arts teacher provides all instruction in Spanish to the ELLs.  Targeted  students participate in differentiated instruction using the “Imagine Learning English” literacy computer technology  program.  Services support and resources correspond to ELL ages and grade levels Parents of newly enrolled ELLs are informed  of community agencies providing summer programs where they can participate and enrich their oral language and listening  skills.  These agencies provide various trips and activities which enhance background knowledge. Students who pre-register in  June are invited to take a tour of the school with their families.  They are provided the opportunity to visit the ENL classroom  while a group is in session.  The family also has an opportunity to visit various classrooms, the gym, and view the music  program and other programs at work.  There are no language electives offered at this school.   Inwood House's P.R.I.M.E. (Productive, Resourceful, Innovative, Motivated & Empowered) LEADERS  is held in P.S. 43 for  students in K-5 from 2:35pm-5:45pm.  The program description states that the focus is on " personal growth for the students,  social responsibility and academic achievement using a service-learning approach.  Students learn how to advocate, engage  and organize their communities through media, business and civic literacy activities that are linked to their needs, concerns  and interests."  The program provides academic support, arts, sports, health education and career exploration activities as well  as family engagement activities.  Specifically, students are provided with one hour a day of homework help and academic  support. 1:1 tutoring is provided as necessary. There is a 1:10 staff to student ratio in the program for all activities.  Some of  the activities include physical education (clubs that target physical fitness and teamwork), using digital and other media  linked  to state learning standards in English Language Arts, Science, Technology, Math and Social Studies.  There is "Word Up!"   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      (Enrichment Literacy) activity which is held twice a week.  Students are engaged in interactive reading, writing, and/or public  speaking activities to prepare for special events, such as, "Bi-annual Career Day", quarterly spelling bees, the "Youth Film  Premiere" (a storytelling event).  "Club Time" is an activity that occurs 2-3 times a week and incorporates art and  culture.  Students are engaged in visual and performing arts clubs, such as, music, dance, theatre, film, painting, cooking,  photography, etc.  Students then participate in quarterly projects, such as, presentations, performances, and competitions, to  build skills and foster social-emotional competencies.   There is time at the end of the day for "Reflection" where students  discuss the things they learned, things that they liked/disliked, and offer suggestions for improvement.  There are field trips, generally designated for Fridays, that are based on the interests, social and educational needs of the  students.   The Millbrook Afterschool program is approximately 2-3 blocks away from the school.  The hours are from 3-6.  Millbrook staff  collect the participating students Monday through Friday, in grades K-5, as a whole group and bring them to their  facility.   Students learn various forms of dance such as Step and Modern.  The program teaches drama and students put on  several shows throughout the school year.  The show that is in current production is called "Under the Sea: The Halloween  Glow in the Dark Party."  Millbrook also provides one hour of homework assistance which is conducted by teachers and  volunteers.   There is a winter camp during the December and February break in addition to a summer camp which runs for  eight weeks.       The Academic needs of the ELLs and all students are promoted through the "Attendance Program", which is ran by Ms.  Rodriguez, the Parent Coordinator.  At an assembly in early September, students attend a special assembly to learn about the  importance of consistent attendance. A school wide activity is used to demonstrate this importance. For example, one year  students were instructed to write about what they miss the most when they are absent from school on an apple picture.  The  students brought back the apples which are then placed on an apple tree in an area near the cafeteria where students line up  for lunch.  This is to remind them as to why they want to come to school!  Stickers for "100% attendance" are awarded to  students at the end of the month.  Those students will have a special activity the following month, such as "Tasty Treat  Day".  These activities are organized by the Parent Coordinator and the Parent Volunteers.     Ms. Rodriguez, the Parent Coordinator, provides many workshops for parents of ELLs and all parents.  There are literacy, math,  and science workshops during the year.  There are library trips and other community trips organized with parents. Parents also  receive training regarding healthy nutrition. Ms. Rodriguez is bilingual in Spanish and English. She is able to translate for the  Spanish dominant parents. There is a translation service that is provided to all schools in the NYCDOE. When parents of low  incidence languages attend parent workshops, we utilize this telephone service..  There is a Parent Volunteer Organization in  P.S. 43.  These volunteers assist during lunch duty, recess, in the classroom, during the Fifth grade moving up ceremony, and in  many other areas of the school.  There is a separate room where the parent volunteers meet, plan, organize and conduct the  various parent workshops.               14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.     Technology is widely used.  All classroom teachers, AIS teachers, program teachers and service providers utilize a SMART  Board to differentiate instruction for this particular group. Technology is also incorporated through the use of computer  programs such as "Imagine Learning English", and websites such as starfall.com and Brainpop.com.  Many classes are equipped  with laptops and ipads, which students consistently utilize. Classes without laptops can borrow several for an activity or for the  day.  Each class in the school has 5 laptops for consistent student usage.  Many classes also incorporate iPads into daily  instruction.  Other classes can sign out 5-7 iPADs for the day from the Computer Lab or UFT Center.  There are several  Applications available that address reading, writing, speaking and listening skills.  The use of technology provides visual aides,  visual cues, and visual modeling.  The SMART Board and the websites are interactive which gives a "hands on" learning  opportunity.  Each class also has a document camera. Teachers can also borrow Student Response handsets to respond to  multiple choice tests on the Smart Board. Students in grades 2-5 receive technology instruction in the computer lab twice a  week by the computer teacher.  At this time, students use Microsoft Word and various instructional websites.  Students in  grades 2,3, and 4 also use "ST Math".   All educators in P.S. 43 use the website Brainpop.com, which provides instruction in  subject areas such as Math, Science, Social Studies, and Music.  A multisensory approach is also incorporated.  All classroom  teachers, cluster teachers, and service providers were provided with mini or regular iPADs.  These have been utilized for note  taking regarding student progress.  The iPADs have been used to provide small group and/or large group instruction through  various Applications.  The students also use manipulatives (play dough, cubes, alphabet tiles) and visuals (word walls,  illustrations, modeling, peer modeling, graphic organizers).  The students are provided with one to one instruction when   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71      possible, and are usually instructed in small groups to address specific skills.  The students also engage in frequent "partner  work" where they work on an activity or task with one other student.  Teachers allows ELL students with disabilities extra time  to complete all activities and tasks.           15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    To enhance native language support, we consult and discuss the results of the formal native language assessment with  parents.   The native language resources  (libraries, texts, technology, primary resource materials) are maintained and available  in the classroom, in the school library, and in the teachers' resource room to assist teacher planning and to accelarate  learning.   Materials are provided to teachers and students in low incidence languages, such as Arabic and French,  also.  Teachers use the Application "Google translate" on their iPADs  to communicate with students and provide native  language support.          16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).     Our ENL teachers provide services through integrated and stand alone programming. The ELL Academic Intervention teachers,  AIS  teachers provide instruction through a push-in and pull-out model.  These services are determined by the number of  students per grade in need of assistance in conjunction with their English Language Proficiency levels. Using grade appropriate  content, the AIS teachers address the needs of students through differentiated instruction and scaffolding.  They implement  the Readers and Writers Workshop models to establish a firm connection between literacy and language  acquisition.  Enhanced read alouds are utilized to build vocabulary and enhance listening skills.Literacy instruction in our ENL  groups is based on the same guiding principles of literacy instruction for our general education classes.  P.S. 43 are using the  Good Habits, Great Writers Curriculum and GO Math to align instruction to the Core Curriculum.  Students will be supported  through differentiated instruction and scaffolding.   ELL students are developing oral language skills, vocabulary,  comprehension, and fluency in reading.  Teaching these strategies in context makes the comprehension process more concrete  and the text more accessible.  By teaching students the comprehension strategies and not just skills, students learn both the  content material and corresponding language and the academic language associated with each subject.  Prior knowledge and  building connections is used to scaffold instruction in various ways in our ENL groups.   To supplement usage of English,  particularly to enhance communication between students for clarification purposes we build vocabulary through authentic and  meaningful experiences with words and also the use of computer technology.  There is ongoing collaboration between the ENL  teachers, AIS teachers, and classroom teachers to align content area instruction.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?     P.S. 43 shares the same building with another school, P.S. 17, which is a District 75 school. P.S. 43 uses all of the classrooms on  the 1st floor and 2nd floor. P.S. 17 uses most of the classrooms on the 3rd and 4th floor. However, there are 5 classrooms that  P.S. 43 uses on the 3rd floor for 4th and 5th grade classes and 1 classroom is used for the Dance Studio. All students in grades  K-5 have Dance once a week with the Dance teacher. P.S. 43 also uses the Library and gym on the 4th floor. P.S. 17 have a  separate gym on the 4th floor that is utilized by their students. The auditorium, the yard, and the cafeteria are shared by both  schools. P.S. 43 have 3 different lunch periods during the school day. Students from PS 17 also have lunch during these times,  but use a separate part of the cafeteria. P.S. 17  have staff that supervise the students. Both schools plan as to when each  school will use the auditorium for various events. Both schools use the yard for recess. Both groups of students from each  school are supervised by staff from their own school, and students play with materials provided by their own school in the  yard.    Technology is widely used.  All classroom teachers, AIS teachers, program teachers and service providers utilize a SMART Board  to differentiate instruction for this particular group. Technology is incorporated through the use of computer programs such as  "Imagine Learning English", an online literacy program called, "iRead,"  and websites such as Starfall.com.  Each class in the  school has 5 laptops and several mini iPads for consistent student usage.  Many classes incorporate iPads into daily  instruction.  When additional iPads are required, teachers  can sign out 5-7 iPADs for the day from the Computer Lab or borrow   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72      some from the UFT Center.  There are several Applications available that address reading, writing, speaking and listening  skills.  The use of technology provides visual aides, visual cues, and visual modeling.  The SMART Board and the websites are  interactive which gives a "hands on" learning opportunity.  Each class also has a document camera. Teachers can also borrow  Student Response handsets to respond to multiple choice tests on the Smart Board. Students in grades 2-5 receive technology  instruction in the computer lab twice a week by the computer teacher.  At this time, students use Microsoft Word and various  instructional websites.  Students in grades 2,3, and 4 also use "ST Math". All educators in P.S. 43 use the website  Brainpop.com, which provides instruction in subject areas such as Math, Science, Social Studies, and Music.  A multisensory  approach is also incorporated.  All classroom teachers, cluster teachers, and service providers were provided with mini or  regular iPADs.  These have been utilized for note taking regarding student progress.  The iPADs have been used to provide  small group and/or large group instruction through various Applications.    The students also use manipulatives (play dough, cubes, alphabet tiles) and visuals (word walls, illustrations, modeling, peer  modeling, graphic organizers).  The students are provided with one to one instruction when possible, and are usually  instructed in small groups to address specific skills.  The students also engage in frequent "partner work" where they work on  an activity or task with one other student.  Teachers allows ELL students with disabilities extra time to complete all activities  and tasks.           18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   New ELLs who enroll throughout the school year receive special attention.  If the student is a native  Spanish speaker, he/she is placed in a class with a bilingual teacher to provide some Native Language  support (if the parent has selected a "Freestanding ENL Program" on the program selection  form).   Teachers  use the Application "Google Translate" on their iPADs to provide native language  support. (The Application is free!)  One can select the language of instruction (i.e. English) and the desired  language (i.e. Arabic).  Simply type the command and press "Go". The written language will appear.  If  you touch the microphone, it will actually say the command in the desired language.  The same can be  done by touching the microphone, talking in English, hit the appropriate space and have that command  stated in the student's native language.  If possible, teachers pair up all new ELLS with a partner who  speaks their native language.  Teachers pair up ELLs with a partner to assist them with tasks and  assignments, even if the partner doesn't speak that native language. P.S. 43 uses the "Imagine Learning  English" program to assist ELLs at all levels.  There are computers available in all classrooms.  In addition,  all classrooms have access to laptops.  The computers and laptops have "Imagine Learning English" in  place.  The students may use the program throughout the day.  The classroom teacher and ENL teacher  can easily monitor progress, print reports, and print out assignments created by the program.  There is  also an ENL enrichment summer program in English, Math, and Science available to select ELLs in grades  2-5.     Parents of newly arrived ELLs are informed of community agencies providing summer programs where  they can participate and enrich their oral language and listening skills.  These agencies provide various  trips and activities which enhance background knowledge.  Students who pre-register in June are invited  to take a tour of the school with their families.  They are provided the opportunity to visit the ENL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73         classroom while a group is in session.  The family also has an opportunity to visit various classrooms, the  gym, and view the music programs at work.       The Parent Coordinator, organizes and hosts events for the parents of ELLs and the parents of all  students. Parents are given information on how to plan and cook healthy meals for their families. For  example, she organized a parent trip to a local farmers market where she showed parents how to pick  healthy food by discussing nutrition, the various food groups, etc. Once a month we have "Cookshop"  which is a program where she explains and demonstrates to  parents how to use various healthy  ingredients to cook delicious meals in a healthful way.  Once a month, we have a Food Pantry in our  school. Forty families in need receive food and recipes. There is a supportive discussion on how to  ingredients if the parents need assistance. Other parent workshops promote parents supporting and  educating their children. The Parent Coordinator held a parent trip to the Botanical Gardens. The purpose  was to demonstrate how important it is to take our children on trips outside the community to see and  learn new information. She explained how this helps to build their background knowledge, which will  help with reading comprehension and learning content subjects such as Science. On another occasion, an  Insurance Representative gave a workshop to parents on saving for college for their children.  A special  guest came to the school and provided a "Family Tech Talk" to teach parents technology skills and to  discuss Cyberbullying and methods to prevent it.  The Parent Coordinator and PA President conduct all  parent workshops and trips in English and Spanish. If parents are present who speak languages other  than English or Spanish, then the NYCDOE telephone translation service is utilized.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   There are no language electives available at P.S. 43.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Paste response to question here:             Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Mondays and Tuesdays are extended days for the staff at P.S. 43.  The time allotted for Professional Development has been  utilized in various ways.  The ENL teachers have provided staff development to Teachers on Tuesday afternoons. The topics  included  using the Bilingual Language Progressions to develop appropriate instruction to target the educational and language  needs of the ELLs in their class, at how to incorporate Modeling, Bridging, Contextualization, Schema Building, Text  Representation, and Developing Metacognition into each lesson for ELLs (also included was a packet titled: The GO TO   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74         Strategies: Scaffolding Options for Teachers of English Language Learners, K-12), promoting academic discourse in the  classroom (setting up discussion & partner work protocols, providing sentence frames for students to start discussions with  each other, teacher discussion of the importance of using these strategies as students write as they speak). The teachers also  received "The Academic Language Function TOOLKIT" which provides sentence frames and activities for using Academic  Language.    The ENL teachers have both attended monthly ENL Liaison meetings and received training on the 4 Hallmarks of ENL  instruction: Engaging Texts, Rich Discussion, Daily Writing, High-Utility Vocabulary words. Both ENL teachers and Ms. Pagan, a  2nd grade teacher with many newcomer ELLs in her classroom, attended a 3 day Q-TEL Professional Development titled  "Promoting Academic Discourse in the Classroom." This Professional Development focused on various strategies to integrate  academic discussion amongst students to promote learning in the four modalities (reading, writing, speaking, and listening).  The staff have participated in Professional Learning Groups. Some of the groups included: Literacy Centers and Rigorous Tasks  through the lens of Domain 3- K-2, Literacy Centers and Rigorous Tasks through the lens of Domain 3- 3-5, Math Strategies,  Problem Solving, Math Centers and Rigorous Tasks through the lens of Domain 3 for grades K-2, Math Strategies, Problem  Solving, Math Centers and Rigorous Tasks through the lens of Domain 3 for grades 3-5, Writing Constructive Responses Aligned  to Rubrics for grades 3-5, Observing Classroom Practice/ Vidoe Analysis: Strategies and Next Steps, and Creating Meaningful  Centers and Rigorous Tasks -  3K and PreK.  Each group presented to the staff and shared ideas, websites, and other materials  for each area.   Our staff has trained in areas pertinent to the education of ELLs. P. S. 43 staff participated in Good Habits,  Great Readers professional development on Balanced Literacy which includes a component to support the need of the ENL/ELL  students.  This curriculum already has differentiation built into the lessons for students with disabilities and English Language  Learners.  All teachers, guidance counselors, occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech therapists, psychologists and  social workers are encouraged to participate in ongoing staff development in the recently established UFT Teacher Center at  P.S. 43.  Ongoing training will be provided in the UFT Center about ReadyGen, GO Math, and other topics during frequent  "Lunch and Learn" workshops.  Teacher/Parent workshops will be on-going and presented in accordance with the LAP’s  academic principles for the high quality instruction of ELL students.  The information from all of these workshops and  conferences is presented to all staff members in our professional development sessions.  Other materials for professional  development relating to ELL education include books and Internet resources available in the teacher’s resource room.  Intra  and Inter visitation to middle schools are ongoing to expose the ELL students with the programs available for them in Middle  School.  Parents are notified of Middle School Open House in the community.  The ENL teachers take the students on class  trips to various middle schools in the community to prepare students for their new environment.  In our endeavor to continue  to provide high quality teaching for our ELLs, we will continue to increase awareness of the needs of ELLs in general  education.  Our teachers, guidance counselors, assistant principals, social workers, psychologists, occupational therapists,  physical therapists, speech therapists, parent coordinator, secretaries and paraprofessionals will attend workshops and  participate in on-going professional development throughout the school year to keep our staff informed of strategies to make  content accessible for all students.  We will continue to develop teaching skills in metacognition and scaffolding instruction, as  these two strategies present the most difficulty for our staff and parents to acquire.  Additionally, the ENL teacher and  Assistant Principal will provide professional development during common preps to support classroom teachers.    We constantly provide opportunities for our staff to attend different workshops and professional development sessions across  the grade.  The Bronx Borough Field Support Centers provide staff development sessions for teachers of ELLs throughout the  school year.  Such workshops/seminars include:  Planning Instruction Aligned to NYSESLAT Targets of Measurement, Planning  Professional Development for All Teachers Responsive to the Needs of ELLs, and Understanding CR-Part 154, What Constitutes  an Effective ENL Program.  These professional development sessions help teachers enhance the delivery of their instruction by  integrating the ENL Common Core Learning Standards with a strong focus on the development of academic language.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   At P.S. 43 we provide our ELL students with information about the different middle schools and the programs they have to  offer.  In addition, the school psychologist and counselor meet with students as needed to support them with transition to  middle school.  Our parent coordinator and ENL teacher provides support to the students and their families in the Middle  School selection process.  P.S. 43 provides a school calendar for parents that outline important dates regarding Middle School  fairs.  Our guidance counselor is actively involved in the selection process and reaches out to parents/guardians in their native  language. The guidance counselor meets with the 5th grade teachers during their common planning and walks them though  the articulation process for the middle school application.  He also calls the parents and set up appointments to go over the  application and the process providing translation as needed.                The minimum 7.5 hours of Ell training for all staff is offered during various Teacher Academies.  These professional  development sessions are offered on various Mondays throughout the school year. Further ELL professional development  sessions may also be conducted for all staff during the school day (1 hour in length).  The ENL teachers  provided training on  Tuesdays to classroom teachers.  All agendas and attendance sheets are maintained and are easily available.

Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    The ENL department individually meets with the parents or guardians of English language learners at least once a year. Parents are  contacted by phone,via a translator if necessary, to schedule an individual appointment to address the progress and/or needs of  each student.  This meeting is in addition to parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or  other scheduled meetings.  The students’ goals, their language development progress, their English language proficiency  assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas are discussed.  This meeting is lead by the student's ENL  teacher but also includes any school staff necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the child’s language  development in all content areas in English.  In addition, the meeting is conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the  language or mode of communication the parent or guardian best understands and attendance is recorded.  In the Spring, in  addition to reviewing the ENL program framework and mandates, we will review the New York State English as a Second Language  Achievement Test and inform the parents about the ELA eligibility due to the No Child Let Behind Law.  Individual Parent-Teacher  meetings are scheduled on Tuesday afternoons during the extended period of the day, and/or the teachers arrange their schedule  to meet with parents to discuss student progress.                            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76              Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I,  As mentioned above, we hold meetings as necessary to discuss the program  framework and ELL assessments.  We specifically address ways parents can assist their children in acquiring  the language and literacy skills necessary to succeed as an English language learner.  In the Spring,we  review the ENL program framework and mandates, we  review the New York State English as a Second  Language Achievement Test and inform the parents about the ELA eligibility due to the No Child Let Behind  Law.  The parent coordinator works with the PTA president, the parents of ELLs and all parents to organize a  parent volunteer service in the school.  The parent volunteers assist with the book fair, attendance  celebrations, lunch, recess, and they assist teachers in various ways in the classroom. They also run a small  coffee shop to sell muffins and refreshments to the teachers.  The profits are used to further train parents  or to fund various projects/materials for the students. The parent volunteers also assist by acting as  translators at parent- teacher conferences.  The needs of the parents will be evaluated by distributing parent surveys during Parent Teacher Meetings  and open school nights. In addition, we will provide information about community resources available to  both parents and students, including adult literacy and ENL classes, homework help, library resources, GED  programs, and educational workshops provided by the school and community agencies throughout the  year.  The P.S. 43 Parent Coordinator provides parent professional development in a variety of areas.  For  example, last September, there was a guest speaker present at the P.T.A. from the "Safe Surfing Program"  and similarly "Family Tech Talk" in which the speaker instructed parents on how to monitor their child's use  of the internet (how to prevent exposure to inappropriate material)as well as.  In addition, she also  planned and hosted  multiple events and workshops for parents throughout the school year. Some of these  events, such as the, Dad Take Your Child to School, featured a guest speaker who talked about the impact  fathers and male role models have on children. Parents also participated in many outdoor events in which  they visited a farmers market in the neighborhood and learned how to choose healthy foods for their family.  Parents travelled to the New York Botanical Garden where they also learned to grow organic fruits and  vegetables, as well as learn how to make important connections among plants, gardening and a healthy  lifestyle. There they learned about the importance of taking children out on trips in order to build their prior  knowledge of the world around them. Some other events -  to help monitor and intercept potential  cyberbullying incidences. Other events engaged parents and children in preparing food, such as making ice  cream, and ways to prepare healthy dishes.     We partner with Eastside House to provide Literacy Workshops afterschool to parents.  The local public  library, The Mott Haven branch, come to P.S. 43 to talk to the parents about literacy.  District 7 provides  literacy and content workshops for parents about the Common Core Curriculum.  These workshops take  place at the District 7 Office located at 501 Courtlandt Avenue in the Bronx.  The Parent Coordinator has instituted an attendance incentives program.  At the beginning of the year at a  special assembly, students were instructed to write about what they miss the most about school when they  are absent.  The written work was transferred to an apple drawing and "hung" up on an apple tree   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77      constructed in the area where students line up for lunch.  The purpose of this activity is to remind students  as to why they want to come to school every day.  Students with perfect attendance receive special  recognition.  They receive a special sticker at the end of the month.  Then there is a special activity held for  them the following month (for example, "Special Treat Day") to recognize and reward their perfect  attendance.  This encourages students with frequent absences to have perfect attendance and improve  academic performance.     The school uses the Home Language Survey, ATS and blue emergency cards on file for all our children, as  well as feedback received at the time of over-the-counter one-to-one registration, to assess the schools  needs for written translation and interpretation to ensure that all of our parents are provided with  appropriate and timely information in their language.  We also gather feedback provided by parents at PTA  meetings and other parent involvement to ensure that we are meeting their interpretation needs  adequately.  All written communication to parents are translated from English to Spanish.  Translators are  available for parent meetings.      On-going monthly parent workshops addressing New York City and State mandates are conducted by our  Parent Coordinator in both English and Spanish.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.
