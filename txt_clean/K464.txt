This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The PSC experience is built upon the vision of a truly integrated school—racially, ethnically, economically and  academically—that leads toward developing a just and equal society.   Students develop the social/emotional skills as well as the academic skills to collaborate and work with students from  all backgrounds.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Recognizing that building a strong sense of community across all backgrounds is challenging, PSC is a small school with  small classes. Teachers know their students well and work with them to develop their social and emotional skills in  the weekly Circles program.   Clear strategies for identifying each student’s academic needs are also developed within and across grade levels to  ensure that each student grows and attains his or her promise. The small number of students in each grade level and  the small number of students in each class ensure that all teachers know all students and can address individual needs  as well as facilitate interactions among students.   The PSC middle school experience will prepare all students for a rigorous high school curriculum and the high school  prepares all graduates for college. Just as importantly, the PSC experience creates socially aware students who can  serve as ambassadors and leaders of a pluralistic society as they become young adults..      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Park Slope Collegiate is a 6-12 school that aspires to the integration—racially, ethnically, economically and  academically—that leads toward developing a just and equal society. Students develop the academic skills as well as  the social/emotional skills to collaborate and work with students from all backgrounds. PSC is a small school with  small classes where teachers employ clear strategies for identifying each student’s academic needs within and across  grade levels to ensure each student’s growth. Teachers know all students and can address individual needs as well as  facilitate interactions among students. The PSC middle school experience will prepare all students for a rigorous high  school curriculum and the high school prepares all graduates for college.      We partner with Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) because we understand that literacy is  foundational for learning, particularly for a school whose mission is to prepare all graduates for college. The focus of  our work with TCRWP is in the middle school but all of our high school English teachers have worked with staff  developers from TCRWP and have adapted much of the philosophy and teachings to the high school setting. The units  of study and methodology of TCRWP are particularly well-adapted to our philosophy of heterogeneous classrooms  because they identify the strategies of accomplished readers and writers and allow students to practice them just  above the level of reading or writing proficiency each student possesses. Classroom libraries contain books for  students below, at and above grade level and the combination of strategy instruction and reading/writing workshop  allow all students to advance.      A more recent and developing initiative is our work with Layered Curriculum as developed by Dr. Kathie Nunley.  Layered Curriculum is a design model that incorporates student choice in assignments, student accountability for  learning rather than completion, and higher order, complex thinking into the curriculum.      We are in the fifth year of a partnership with CUNY’s STEM initiative Peer Enabled Restructured Classroom (PERC). In  Living Environment and Algebra PERC classrooms, students receive support from Teaching Assistant Scholars (TAS).  The TAS are students who have already completed the course and achieved proficiency but not mastery on the NYS  Regents exam. The TAS meet daily with the LE or Algebra teacher to study teaching methodology as well as content.  In addition to providing extraordinary peer support to first-time students of LE and Algebra, the PERC program also  leads to high levels of engagement and achievement among the TAS who retake the Regents exams at the end of the  year. We have also committed to expanding PERC and LE and Algebra classes for our entire 8th grade.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Teaching artists from the Atlantic Theater Company (ATC) work with every student in grades 9 and 10 for 6 weeks and  with 11 th grade students for 8 weeks. In the 9 th and 10 th grades ATC partners with the ELA teachers to engage  students twice a week in a writers workshop and theater workshop that culminate in an ensemble performance of a  piece created from student writing. The impact on the classroom community and the social/emotional development  of students is evident in the cohesiveness of their ensemble and the raw emotion of their writing and performance.      A staff developer from the Urban Memory Project works with our Senior History teacher to maintain and expand  upon the curriculum of our DOE college-preparatory certified Participation in Government: Brooklyn History class.  Additionally she works with MS social studies teachers in designing CCLS-aligned projects and units.      We are in the sixth year of an initiative to implement weekly 40-minute Circles of 10-15 students and one faculty  member. This community-building and social/emotional learning initiative, based on the philosophies and practices of  Restorative Approaches, has led to a precipitous decline in suspensions and general improvement in school tone and  culture. It is coupled with work in Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) that is sustained and led by a lead teacher  resulting in an effective system that addresses barriers to social and emotional health and academic success. Many  staff members are trained in both Tier 1 and Tier 2 Restorative Approaches.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Over 25% of our student population receives special education services and over 10% are English Language Learners.  We practice full inclusion and all the initiatives above facilitate the inclusion and service to these special populations.  The prevalence of ICT classrooms is another structure that supports progress for all students.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   We have made tremendous progress in delivering rigorous instruction in a supportive environment. We believe that  these two elements are the foundation of a great school.   Our focus this year on enhancing collaboration of teachers and effective school leadership will be to enhance that  instruction and environment.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     1. School focuses instruction on "maximizing student engagement with content." (PPO 17-18)   Many teachers implement Layered Curriculum to address the needs of all learners and to incorporate increased use of  arts and technology (QR 2016).   Introduction of the PERC program in 9 th grade has resulted in increased performance in math and science, particularly  in moving students from proficiency to mastery as measured by Regents scores (Regents data). Introducing Algebra  and the PERC in the 8th grade two years ago has led to more rigor, equity and collaborative engagement (PPO 17-18)       2. PRIORITY NEED: More rigorous math and science curricula are needed in the 8 th grade to increase students’  performance on math and science assessments and in readiness for high school.   These strengths and needs align to the following elements of the Framework for Great Schools:   Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative Teachers and Supportive Environment.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, teachers of eighth grade students will design and deliver rigorous instruction to improve students’  performance outcomes in Common Core Algebra and Living Environment Regents, as measured by a 5% increase in  participation rates and a 5% increase in passing rates.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Weekly circles for community building and social/emotional learning are incorporated into every student’s  schedule resulting in a precipitous drop in classroom removals and suspensions (OORS 2017-2018). 50% of staff are  trained in Tier 1 and Tier 2 Restorative Approaches.   Over 10% of the teaching staff has participated in Collaborative Problem Solving study groups contributing to the  decline in classroom removals (OORS 2017-2018).   Including three guidance counselors and a lead teacher responsible for CPS in our staff, rather than deans,  communicates the role of all adults in creating a healthy school environment (PPO 2017-2018).   "The school's process works and keeps more students in school as opposed to being out of school on suspensions  while strengthening the bond between staff and students ultimately increasing student achievement" (PPO 2018- 2018).   2. Students often fall behind in their classes because they do not yet have the skills to manage their environment  outside of school and their social relationships in school. Inability to manage family and social problems impacts  student focus on learning.   3.

The 14-15 QR report states that teacher teams and leadership development earned a Well Developed rating. The QR  report indicates that “teachers meet regularly in grade and content specific teams”. Though meetings are held  regularly, the role of teacher leaders to lead department and grade teams needs to be formalized. The teacher  leaders run meetings based on student work, however missed opportunities exist in terms of strategizing vertical  planning as teacher leaders (grade and department leaders) do not meet regularly to align meeting agenda to the  school mission. The QR report indicates that “Teacher leaders assume a leadership role in supporting colleagues in  instructional decisions that impact curriculum development.” However, as teacher teams meet to discuss student  learning and curricula, increased systems and structures need to be set up by the school leaders to ensure team  meetings are used effectively to address and improve attendance and student academic achievement as a whole.  Increased support for teacher leadership roles in expanding the Collaborative Problem Solving work and Restorative  Circles will also increase student social-emotional support and will result in improved student achievement and  graduation rates which has been identified as a FOCUS area of need.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.

The 14-15 QR report indicates that “parents feel welcome in the school” and that “the school provides opportunities  for them to participate in workshops regarding instructional practices”. Though the school has a full time college  counselor, as the school grows the parents have requested, at an SLT meeting, a more robust college program and an  internship program. Though the parent created newsletter “The Pulse” has initiated increased communication of  school and community events, the newsletter needs to be run by a full-time parent coordinator with strong roots in  the community who can continue to strengthen our parent base to leverage community support of the students. The  creation of an internship program and increased collaborative school-wide and community service events will  increase student, parent, community engagement around the school mission.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Our Peer Collaborative teacher and 2 mentor teachers help retain highly qualified staff and our professional  development and staff leadership strategies both attract and retain highly qualified staff. We collaborate with  Brooklyn College, New York University, and City Tech to host student teachers and to host field observation cycles.  This allows us to attract highly qualified teachers. Our turnover rate is extremely low and we also rely on current staff  to help recruit for our growth positions. We host NYCTF programs for the summer that allow us to meet and assess  Teaching Fellow candidates. We are able to meet over 90% of the program preferences that teachers submit in the  spring. In addition to weekly professional development meetings that allow for teacher leadership, lead teacher host  afterschool study groups and we host two weekend professional development conferences each year.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Our Peer Collaborative Teacher participates in and leads professional development for Collaborative Problem Solving  that is open to teachers and paraprofessionals. He hosts study groups to ensure commitment and growth of CPS. Our  Mentor Teachers and other teacher leaders at the school serve as official mentors for new teachers. Science and math  teachers participate in on-going professional development through Hunter College's Peer Enabled Restructured  Classroom program. Our social studies department works with a staff developer from the Urban Memory Project.  Additionally, members of our staff participate in the DOE led Academic Behaviors Pilot and teacher-led study groups  all address the CCSS and engage teachers in regular PD utilizing Understanding By Design. We save all PD resources on  a google drive available to all teacher and paraprofessional with a special folder for ICT classes. Paraprofessionals  meet with grade teams and are invited to all full-faculty meetings and conferences as well as central PD offerings.  Administration meets weekly to share best practices and the principal attends monthly meetings with the  Superintendent.        Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     All teachers meet independently of and together with the administration to agree on appropriate assessments and  professional development. Teachers meet in department teams weekly at Monday PD time and grade teams meet  weekly during lunch period in order to ensure assessments align to CCSS. Our PD emphasized UbD and the creation of  authentic assessments at the beginning of the curriculum planning process. Our grading policy requires 5 summative  assessments per marking period that teachers record on Skedula. As a small school, the majority of teachers are the  sole teacher for their course which encourages additional autonomy and participation in the development of  assessments. All teacher observation conferences include a discussion of assessments and student progress to  provide teachers with one-on-one instructional leadership around assessment.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Section 5        Section 5        Section 5       1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20.

Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Park Slope Collegiate is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Park Slope Collegiate will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students           providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;   Park Slope Collegiate will support parents and families of Title I students by:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40              Conduct yearly Parent Association elections for the Executive Board    Conduct monthly Parent Association meetings    Provide the opportunity for parents to take on active roles on the School Leadership Team (E.g. Review and   update of school mission statement, review and creation of a school selection policy, review of school  budget)     Hold 6th and 9th grade level orientations for parents    Hold a Curriculum Night to orient parents with specific subject goals, curriculum maps and big   understandings     Use of the translation service or staff members to translate and distribute notices in native languages    Translators are hired/staff retained to provide services at school functions and conferences    Hold workshops and conferences for parents and teachers    Hold regular scheduled parent and school meetings (e.g. SLT, PTA, and parent conferences)    Host school events (e.g. Curriculum Night, Performance Night, Game Night, ATC Performance etc.)    Access to materials and resources that will be made available to parents for in school and/or at home use  to support their child’s learning and monitor student progress (electronic calls for attendance, PupilPath,  school website)   Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation (e.g. school survey) of the content and effectiveness of this  parent involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the  evaluation through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the  needs of parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.          In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and         strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing  technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  conduct parent workshops with topics that may include:, understanding educational accountability grade- level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training (ARIS, )to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home; provide opportunities for  parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., State accountability system, student  proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, Learning Environment  Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41         schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the  Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; (E.g Curriculum Night, Parent Engagement Hours)  translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;               The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement        hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school   year;   Curriculum Night,   Performance Night   Annual ATC Performance   Game Night    6th Grade/9th Grade August Orientations   Middle School & High School Fairs   PSC School Tours   Parent Walkthroughs   Transcript Workshops   High School Application Workshops   Midwinter Festival   Presentation & Arts Night   Parent/Student Sports Night   Parent/Teacher Conferences   Teacher/Staff Home Visits to Families Home   Staff, Parent, Student Participation in the Annual School Spring Retreat   SING   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Drama Club Performances   Career Day     encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-  Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  supporting or hosting Family Day events; (Annual Back to School Picnic)       establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents (Parent   Room);     encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;    providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their   children’s progress;(E.g.Skedula , report cards)     developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about   school activities and student progress; (Skedula, PSC Website, PTA Pulse)      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Park Slope Collegiate, is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student  achievement between the school and the families.

The program will support the  development of Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP) and content area enrichment  in Global History, U.S. History, and English Language Arts.  Direct instruction components of  our program at Park Slope Collegiate include Academic Support Sessions (after school),  Immigration Study (after school), and Global History for ELLs (Saturday Academy).  All  documentation of student participation and parent outreach will be be kept in the ELL Data  Binder and/or a live roster and outreach log that is accessible to content-area teachers and  administrators through a shared folder on our Park Slope Collegiate Google Drive.  Student  attendance and participation will be documented on a shared document, documentation of parent  outreach on a separate document, and program notification letters in parents’ preferred language  will be kept in hard-copy in our ELL Data Binder with all other parent communication, secured  in Room 411, the ENL classroom.    Academic Support After School Program  The crux of our program is based on Academic Support sessions that supplement the linguistic  demands students encounter in their mainstream classes with direct tutoring and after school  instruction.  The goal of each session is to provide specific academic language for performative  assessments assigned in content-area classes.  Instruction will vary and utilize the scaffold of  contingency based on a measure of linguistic and academic needs of the students.  All 50 ELLs  will be invited to attend these sessions based on need (upcoming perfomance-based assessments)  and grades (all ELLs failing a content-area course will be required to attend).  Academic Support  sessions will meet on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 3:30-4:30 and will be staffed by one of  our two ENL-certified teachers, Jennifer Miller or Louise Bauso.  Sessions will begin after the  first marking period has concluded and grades have been submitted on on October 30, 2016 and  will continue until the end of May, when it will be replaced with our after-school Immigration  Study (described below).  A live roster of student participation and topics covered in Academic  Support sessions will be kept in shared document that is accessible to all faculty at Park Slope  Collegiate.      Immigration Study  The second after school component of our Title III program, an Immigration Study, will meet  two times a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:30-4:30 beginning on May 2, 2017 and  continue for 9 consecutive sessions, concluding with a trip to Ellis Island on June 1.   The  program will be centered around an Immigration Study and team taught by Jennifer Miller  (ENL/ELA certified) and Julia Kondrad (11th grade ELA).  Twelve ELLs in grades 9-12 (5 of  whom are SIFE) will participate in this after school program, and goals include strengthening  language skills in all four modalities and prepare students for NYSESLAT, ELA Common Core,  and  US History Regents exams, thus improving scores.  Instruction will be differentiated by   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   grade, proficiency level, and individual needs.  The curriculum will consist of group readings  about immigration trends in New York City today in the 1880s. This program will require the  purchase of ten iPads along with their chargers, headphones, and a cart to securely store them.  Each group of three will choose to focus on a close study of countries that have large numbers of  their populations immigrating to New York City today, using these texts as a springboard.  iPads  are essential because this particular program will necessitate something portable with different  video options on iMovie. They will research the geography, culture and reasons for immigration  about specific ethnicities to New York City today and during the 1880s. This will entail reading  supplemental texts from the Hampton Brown Edge series, and research about these groups using  artifacts. This program will provide students with opportunities to master the following Common  Core Standards' in ELA and History/Social Studies: Analyze how a text makes connections  among and between individuals, ideas and events; engage effectively in a range of collaborative  discussions, building on others' ideas and expressing their own clearly and integrating visual  information with other information in print and digital text. Similarly, this program will bolster  students' proficiency levels (as judged via the NYSESLAT), prepare students for both the ELA  and U.S History Regents.  This program will require an experiential learning field trip to Ellis Island on Saturday, June 3,  2017.  Ms. Miller and Ms. Julia Konrad will attend the trip. The duration of the trip is 5 hours,  from 10-3. This trip will be essential in student hands-on research about the immigrant groups of  the past. Students will use their iPads in order to photograph artifacts in the museum, as well as  its outside. They will learn how to use the Notes application to gather information about their  specific immigrant groups from the 1880s. They would then copy and paste these notes onto a  word document. Students will create skits about the immigrant groups from the past, using  information from the various aforementioned resources. Using the iPads collaboratively will be  essential to the various types of research that this unit entails. They will help students do the  initial research on their immigrant groups via use of the Internet and the notes application.  Students will also use the Notes application to write drafts, revise, write second drafts, and then  edit. They would then copy paste these notes onto a word document where they could publish the  lines of their films.  After publishing, students will prepare to perform their skits on videotape by first practicing their  lines by using the iPads' voice memos in its utilities menu. Ms. Miller and Ms. Siegel will  provide assistance in modeling pronunciation and prosody. Students will use the iPads'  headphones in order to keep their practice private, until they feel more comfortable and ready to  share out with the class.      Global History Regents Prep:  For four Saturday sessions prior in January and June, Louise Bauso (certified ENL/Adolescent  Social Studies) will push into a Saturday Academy for Global History with the 10th grade Global  History teacher, William Treece. Ms. Bauso will conduct outreach to ensure that all of our 8 10th  grade ELLs, as well as 11th and 12th grade students still in need of passing the Global History  Regents will attend these sessions.  Mr. Treece will work with a larger group including Former  ELLs and non-ELLs, while Ms. Bauso will conduct mini-lessons and support the ELLs in the  program.  Only Ms. Bauso will be paid with Title III funds.   This program will prepare students for the Global History Regents in the weeks before they sit  for the exam.  The focus for ELLs will be only the academic language necessary to complete  thematic and document-based essays.  Much of the curriculum in New York State Global History  revolves around an emphasis on Western Civilization.  This program will give students the  opportunity to focus on the ways that Western Civilization impacted their countries and vice  versa.  Students in the program will have the choice of exploring the countries of their ancestors,  or the U.S. Students will use iPads in order to quickly use Google Translate and Wikipedia, as   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   needed.  Classes will meet from 10-12:30 on the following Saturdays: January 7, 14, and 21 and  May 13, 20, 27, and June 3 and 10.  The ENL and Global History teacher will carefully design a  curriculum that differentiates learning for students based on a host of factors, including: literacy  skills in the L1, proficiency levels as determined by the NYSESLAT scores of the last 3 years,  SIFE status, and instructions mandated by IEPs.  The goals of this program are to bolster student  achievement as measured by the NYSESLAT, the Global Regents, the US History Regents and  the English Regents. Student attendance and participation will be documented on a shared  document accessible to all Park Slope Faculty.  Program notification letters in parents’ preferred  language will be kept in our ELL Data Binder with all other parent communication, secured in  Room 411, the ENL classroom.

These Professional Development activities will  take place in Room 411, our ESL classroom. There will be a total of six study group sessions on  the following dates: 10/27, 11/10, 12/1, 1/19, 2/16 and 3/16. Each of these teachers will be paid  per session for each study group session.  These sessions will be one and a half hours in duration.  The professional text needed for this group is "Getting Started with English Language Learners,  How Educators Can Meet the Challenge" by Judie Haynes. The first session (10/27) will focus  Key Concepts of Second-Language Acquisition. Session II (11/10) How students acquire Social  and Academic Language.  On 12/1: Language Progressions: What are they and how do we use  them? On 1/19 Part IV: Correlating Instruction with the Stages of Second-Language Acquisition.  Session 5 (2/16) will center around Haynes's chapter on Challenges for ELLs in Content-Area  Classes On 3/16: Differentiating Instruction for English Language Learners.  This study group will positively impact the progress of ELLs in that Ms. Tiffany and Ms. Yousef  will have a heightened understanding of language acquisition and integrating language and  content instruction for English Language Learners. They also will be equipped to implement the  Common Core Learning standards and in particular adapt course materials so that ELLs have  access to grade level content information.  Jennifer Miller, who is leading this study group will receive ongoing PD offered through  Brooklyn North Field Support Center's Study Group Sole ENL Provider. Its first meeting will be  held on Thursday, October 20th from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. at 131 Livingston St. Brooklyn in Room  508 B.

Bilingual faculty members, either Cory Deoleo or Zandra Cuevas,  will provide translation for these events in Spanish and Georgette Lutfi (paraprofessional) will  translate for Arabic speakers.   The Translation hotline will be used for parents speak languages  other than Spanish or Arabic.  Title III funds will be used to purchase food for these events.  We  will maintain records of agendas, attendance sheets, and invitations in parent’s preferred  languages in the school’s ELL Data Binder, stored in Room 411, as well as on the shared  document for Parent Outreach.  Event #1: Digital Literacy  As the majority of our ELLs have computers with Internet access at home, our ENL teacher will  discuss different ways of encouraging their children to read in libraries online. Parents will also  learn about a host of websites that are available free of charge which provide opportunities for  their children to practice English pronunciation, grammar, listening skills, reading, and  writing.  This event will take place on Thursday, November 17 from 4:00-6:00 p.m. and because  of the interactive nature of the event, both ENL teachers will help facilitate.  Event #2: POV Documentary Screening  Park Slope Collegiate will host a community screening of  Sin Pais (Without Country), a PBS  POV documentary exploring one family's complex and emotional journey involving  deportation.  POV films showcase documentary film as an art form and can also be used to  present information, get people interested in taking action on an issue, provide opportunities for  people from different groups or perspectives to exchange views and create space for  reflection.  We hope to build this film screening program for ELLs and their parents into a  frequent occurrence, but will begin with Monday, January 23 for our first screening.  Louise  Bauso and Zandra Cuevas (Spanish translation) will facilitate.  Event #3: Demystifying the NYSESLAT  Explanatory session on Wednesday, May 3 from 4:00-5:30 to explain the components of the  NYSESLAT exam that will administered the following week, as well as tips for helping children  do their best on a test.  Event will include individual family conferencing on NYSESLAT scores  from last year and both ENL teachers, Louise Bauso and Jen Miller, will present.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  This year we are using the formative assessment developed by TCRWP in our middle school. The TCRWP offers a set of  informal reading inventories for narrative texts which correlates to the Fountas and Pinnell system for leveling books. These  assessments help teachers identify which level of texts students can read independently and will therefore be able to practice  all the reading strategies they are learning during the Reading Workshop. The assessments provide an analysis of  comprehension, miscues, and, fluency (fluency is only assessed for Levels J-Z). This data, along with that culled from our  extensive intake interview process, show that our students enter our program with a wide variety of prior schooling, academic  skills, and literacy skills (in both English and their native   languages). This data provides teachers with the information they need to properly differentiate their content   area, project-based curricula, which is delivered to a student population that is heterogeneous on many fronts.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      In both our middle and high school we use the NYSITELL, Spanish LAB and the NYSESLAT to provide ourselves with important  quantitative information. We differentiate instruction to meet their varied needs through use of an array of levels of texts,  conferencing, and carefully assigned student groups.  Students new to our school are given the oral interview questionnaire to  determine whether or not they have a gap of two or more years in schooling.  Our school also uses teacher-based tasks to  assess early literacy skills. These tasks consist of written work as well as assessment of students’ decoding and comprehension  skills.  Students are tested specifically on phonemic awareness through minimal pairs tasks.  The writing assessment asks  students to write about their favorite time of year.  These data provide important insights regarding our English Language  Learners' readiness for reading complex texts and engaging in high level writing tasks.  The data also provides school staff with  information about computational and mathematical understanding.  ELLs who require further support in literacy are provided  with after school tutoring opportunities as well as assistance in the ENL class.  The instructional plan of the school takes into  account student literacy needs.  Teachers provide scaffolds for our low-literacy learners to assist them in acquiring the content  while also developing literacy skills.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   At the beginning of the school year our ENL teachers meet for an hour of each day of the first week to closely review the data  of our ELLs prior to programming them.  After drafting a programming plan they meet with the principal and programmer to  decide on appropriate instructional plans. For the rest of the school year the ENL teachers have a study group to analyze  successes and challenges. At the end of each month Jennifer Miller meets with Principal Jill Bloomberg to implement changes.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs through various measures, including the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, Middle School  New York State exams and Regents exams. After reviewing class grades and progress in language development as measured  through formative assessment throughout the school year we modify our programs based on the data with a focus on  language modalities.  Formative assessments, including journal writing, Socratic seminars, literary and argumentative writing  are evaluated based on rubrics that include language-based as well as content-based criteria.                   4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once summative data has been gathered we carefully analyze our curriculum maps for our freestanding ENL courses and  modify as needed, paying attention to both content and language objectives. For our collaborative ENL teaching we work with  content area teachers to implement necessary changes. We use the Common Core new language arts standards to shape our  interventions. Similarly, we use the appropriate new New York State Common Core Learning Standards for each content area  (math, science, social studies, English Language Arts).      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]     For each English language learner who scores below specified levels of performance on the annual English language  proficiency assessment, our school determines the additional support services to provide the student, taking into  consideration evidence such as the following:                 6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Instruction is aligned with the data from the most recent NYSESLAT, NYSITELL and Spanish LAB results. Planning for the  upcoming school year is pending on the results of the NYSESLAT for both our middle and high school. In addition, for high  school we analyze the Regents Exams:  ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies results. For middle school we use the New York  State Exams for ELA, Math and Science. Students are programmed according to the level they attained on these exams, and  appropriate modifications are provided in their classes according to their proficiency levels.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54                    7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Consultation is ongoing between ENL and content area teachers and is supported by administration.  Integrated teaching  involves content and ENL teachers planning together as a means to supporting ELLs.  Differentiation and scaffolding strategies  are incorporated into lesson planning as well as unit planning.  Teachers employ strategies, such as vocabulary mapping,  previewing text, graphics, graphic organizers, and cooperative learning to ensure that the entering/emerging student can  access content material as well as develop the academic language required for that content area.   Furthermore, strategic  grouping is used in class to ensure that language development is a focus. English language learners are paired with students  who share the native language, so that they can access the content while acquiring structures and vocabulary in the new  language.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   We have a freestanding ENL program for both our middle and high school  We program our freestanding program  according to student proficiency levels. In middle school entering students receive 180 minutes of standalone minutes  and 180 minutes of integrated services. Emerging students receive 90 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 integrated.  Transitioning and expanding level students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL.  In high school Entering  ELLs  receive 540 minutes of ENL, emerging students receive 360 minutes, transitioning, expanding students receive 180  minutes, commanding 90 minutes.  Programming decisions are made based on student NYSESLAT scores.  Currently,  there are two programmed/pull-out transitioning classes, a heterogenenous class of entering through transitioning,  and a co-teaching class, which includes a heterogeneous group (transitioning through expanding) of ELLs.   In our  freestanding classes the grade span we use is two contiguous grades and the proficiency levels are heterogeneous.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Not Applicable    c.  DL program.

How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?            Our middle school ENL students are programmed according to their proficiency levels:   Entering students receive 180 minutes of stand-alone ENL and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL. Emerging students receive 180  minutes of stand alone ENL and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL. Our Transitioning students receive 180 minutes per week, with  90 minutes in stand-alone ENL and the other 90 in Integrated ENL. Our Expanding students in grades 6-8 receive 180 minutes  per week of integrated ENL/ELA per week. In our stand-alone classes the grade span we use is two contiguous grades and the  proficiency levels are are heterogeneous.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      Similarly, our high school students are programmed according to their proficiency levels.  Entering students receive a total of 540 minutes per week with 360 minutes of stand-alone ENL and 180 minutes of Integrated  ENL. Emerging students receive a total of 360 minutes per week with 180 minutes of stand alone ENL and 180 minutes of  Integrated ENL. Our Transitioning students receive a total of 180 minutes: 90 minutes of stand-alone ENL  minutes per week,  with the other 90 in Integrated ENL. Our expanding students in grades 9-12 receive 180 minutes per week of integrated  ENL/ELA per week. In our stand-alone classes the grade span we use is two contiguous grades and the proficiency levels are  are heterogeneous.  Former ELLs in both middle and high school receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL services.              3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Content area courses are delivered in heterogeneous proficiency levels, and by grade level. Language development and  support for content instruction in the native language is provided when same language grouping is possible. Such support  includes bilingual dictionaries, native language classroom libraries, and peer tutoring. We use a sheltered instructional model  with content area teachers applying methodologies informed by their understanding, and training in teaching ELLs. Teacher  are part of grade teams which work together to develop curriculum and materials to scaffold information for ELLs in order to  meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards.          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Our curriculum incorporates the use of native language in many different ways. Students may work in native language groups  to complete certain tasks and then come back to a mixed language group to share their findings or results. When possible,  students may present their findings in their native language to an audience of the same language. This leads to an expanding  student translating all of the group's answers to a bilingual ENL teacher. teacher. She informally evaluates these discussions,  documenting them on conference notes. The vast majority of our ELLs are L1 Spanish speakers; oftentimes Socratic Seminars  will take place in History, ENL and ELA  classes in both English and Spanish in order for different proficiency leveled students  are formally evaluated. The evaluation is centered on students' use of accountable talk -- which is taught and translated to all  of our ELLs of all language groups.           5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     a. SIFE students who are in need of instructional support are identified by our ENL teachers through analysis of the  NYSITELL scores/Spanish Lab (if applicable) and the DOE's LENS .  SIFE students are assigned for before or after school  individual tutoring and after school/Saturday academic programs. In all content area classes, all SIFE students are  heterogeneously mixed with their ELL peers. Instruction in all classes target SIFE students' needs by providing multiple  strategies for the acquisition of both language and content, including: leveled reading materials, jigsaw reading, collaborative  group work, oral presentations, project-based assessments, scaffolding, differentiation and QTEL strategies.   b. Newcomer ELLs are placed in heterogeneous ENL and content area classes with ELL peers of varying academic, linguistic and  ethnic backgrounds. Instruction in all classes incorporates multiple strategies  for the acquisition  of both language and  content, including: leveled reading materials, jigsaw readings, collaborative group work, oral presentations, project-based  assessments, scaffolding, differentiation, and QTEL strategies. Newcomers are encouraged to participate in after school  programs which include various arts programs (music and visual arts) as well as literacy and math building programs.   c.ELLS receiving service for 4 to 6 years of service are placed in heterogeneous ENL and content area classes with ELL peers of  varying academic, linguistic and ethnic backgrounds. Instruction in all classes incorporates multiple strategies for the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      acquisition of both language and content, including: leveled reading materials, jigsaw readings, collaborative group work, oral  presentations, project-based assessments, scaffolding, differentiation, and QTEL strategies.   d. Long term ELLs are placed in heterogeneous ENL and content area classes with ELL peers of varying academic, linguistic and  ethnic backgrounds. Instruction in all classess incorporates multiple strategies for the acqusition of both language and content,  including: leveled reading materials, jigsaw readings, collaborative group work, oral presentations, project-based assessments,  scaffolding, differentiation, and QTEL strategies.   e. Our plan for former ELLS is for content area teachers and ENL  teacher to confer on a monthly basis on their progress in all  of their classes. Collaboratively they will plan for the use of scaffolds (such as graphic organizers, think pair shares, jigsaws,  informed groupings) in order to meet the demands of the Common Core standards.            6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers use graphic organizers, adapted materials, text previews, film, and leveled texts as pre-reading activities, which  support the ELL-SWD who is confronted with a challenging grade level text.  Scaffolding of the materials is essential in  providing support to the ELL-SWD.   Language development is accelerated through a focus on learning vocabulary tier 2 and  tier 3 vocabulary items.  Grade level materials include literary texts, content textbook and primary source documents.  ELLs are  supported through the use of IPads and smart boards in the classrooms.  The administration works with the programmer to  ensure that all ELL-SWDs whose IEP mandates ENL instruction receive the appropriate program, including bilingual instruction  if mandated.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  We carefully evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs by carefully comparing student growth in terms of language  proficiency as measured on the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT. We examine whether a students has grown in terms of a growth  in levels; or growth within a level. We regularly examine data available on ATS and use rubrics that integrate ELA and ENL  performance standards for reading and writing throughout the year.          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  In order to assist our students in ELA, our LAP team has focused on:      Newcomers:  Teachers will use various strategies to focus on reading and listening comprehension skills, including graphic  organizers, outlining techniques, cloze exercises and dictations.  Student will do self-paced work on duolingo.   SIFE:  Students will participate in focused SIFE tutoring after school.  In class, focus will be on developing skills in making  inferences, identifying main idea, and making predictions during reading.

Our targeted interventions for ELLS in Social Studies:     Newcomers:  Materials will be chunked into manageable portions; teachers will adapt written text to student level.  SIFE:  Students will be provided with shorter assignments and given writing templates to help develop writing in social studies.  ELLS 4-6:  Students will be teamed with class buddies to help them with material.  SpEd:  Teachers will use the arts and technology to reinforce concepts.  Longterm:  Teachers will make historical events accessible to students through the use of technology and multi-media projects.     Intervention services in our school include the guidance counselor, PRY and SPARK.  These services are conducted in English or  Spanish.     Transitional support will be provided for ELLS for up to 2 years after testing out of ESL services.  Content area and ENL teachers  work cooperatively to ensure that transitional students are supported through differentiated assignments.  The ENL teachers  support the students in understanding content area work.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      New programs that will be considered for the upcoming school year are use of CERCA and Castle Learning      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Not applicable      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Saturday Academy: Our Saturday Academy offers both remediation and enrichment in Science, Mathematics, ELA, and ESL.  Additionally, regent’s and SAT preparation are offered. Attendance rates are at over 90% for this outreach program.  •     Family Celebrations: Throughout the year, parents come to the school to take part in community celebrations, including  the Presentation Night, Awards Night, Karaoke Night and Sports & Arts Presentation. At these events, the school and  community can come together to recognize student achievements in arts and academics.   •     Translation and Interpretation Services: These services are offered to increase the involvement of parents. Additional  funding is available to translate important policy documents, mainly in Spanish. Additionally, interpretation services are a daily  help in communication between school staff and parents.               Our ELLs, along with all other students in our high school are also required to participate in a partnership that PSC has with the  Atlantic Theater Company. This company provides a host of objectives that greatly aid our ELLs. It provides use of academic  language and basic communication skills in a manner that is inclusive of ELLs at all proficiency levels. The Atlantic Theater  Company pushes students in all four modalities (listening, speaking, reading and writing) and allows drama to serve as a  vehicle to lower the affective filter.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      ELLs  are invited to attend through a letter sent home to their parents in their preferred language.           12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Across ENL proficiency levels we incorporate the use of Google docs, forms, and slides. This is helpful particularly for  differentiating assessment products that students create according to their particular needs. Similarly, we use Google  classroom to share assignments, leveled texts, and slides. This provides a way for students to review classwork easily.      For Entering and Emerging students we use the website Tarheel  reader which has age-appropriate books for lower reading  levels. For all students we also use duolingo  and Rosetta Stone which allows us to precisely target individual linguistic needs.     In ELA and Social Studies courses                        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Our curriculum incorporates the use of home language in many different ways. Students may work in home language groups  to complete certain tasks and then come back to a mixed language group to share their findings or results. When possible,  students may present their findings in their home language to an audience of the same language. This leads to an Expanding  student translating all of the group's answers to Jennifer Miller or Louise Bauso, our ENL  teachers. They informally evaluate  these discussions, documenting them on conference notes. The vast majority of our ELLs are L1 Spanish speakers; oftentimes  Socratic Seminars will take place in History, ENL and ELA classes in both English and Spanish in order for different proficiency  leveled students' summative evaluations. The evaluation is centered on students' use of accountable talk -- which is taught and  translated to all of our ELLs of all language groups.            14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Our support services for ELLs include our guidance department, who are available to see all students.  As a small school, our  guidance department is able to get to know our students on an individual basis, and to assist them with any issues that  arise.  Guidance staff and the social worker support students based on their grade/age.  In addition to guidance, the following  services are available to all students, including ELLs: additional special education services if necessary based on a full  educational evaluation, nurse, speech, resource room , social worker, psychologist and SPARK.   All services, including guidance  counselor, social worker, speech teacher, psychologist and occupational therapist are adapted for ELL-SWDs to correspond to  their ages and grades as well as their cognitive needs. Each unit and its materials correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels are  considered very carefully during our biweekly ELA department meetings. Since these meetings consist of teachers of grades 6- 12 these meetings assure appropriate support and resources.          15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our school shares a building and many resources. This includes social workers, speech teachers, psychologists and  occupational therapists. Our ELL Coordinator and The Secondary School for Journalism's, Deirdre Quinn, meet once a month to  discuss curriculum that they can share to fit both schools' needs. Similarly, we discuss and share any compliance updates that  occur throughout the school year. Each spring we grade each others NYSESLAT writing sections.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Activities will be provided to assist newly enrolled ELLs in becoming acclimated to our school, our city and our country.  Some  of the activities include:  newcomers’ breakfast; student buddies in their content area classes.  We also provide summer  orientation sessions for our entering 9th grade classes where students and parents have the opportunity to meet with their  teachers, engage in curriculum exploration, and become familiar with the culture of the school.  All students, including ELLs,  are invited to participate. Before the start of the beginning of the school year newly enrolled ELL students and their parents  meet with the ENL teacher, Jennifer Miller. She describes our ENL program, our classes in general and gives students a brief  tour of the school. She discusses the mission of Park Slope Collegiate, which is to prepare all of students for college. With  Spanish speaking students/parents Ms. Miller conducts the tour in Spanish. For students of other L1s she uses bilingual school  personnel or over the phone interpretation service.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    The language elective that is offered to ELLs is Spanish.         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable.      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  We will engage in those activities which support our ENL and general education teachers in providing the necessary  adaptations and strategies for the ELL student.  The ENL teacher will attend professional development meetings through  Brooklyn North Field Support and the Office of English Language Learners. The teacher will turn-key all information at PD  sessions to assistant principals, paraprofessionals, subject area teachers, psychologists, occupational/physical therapists,  speech therapists, secretaries and the parent coordinator.    Calendar of PD:      November 13th: Scaffolds/strategies for our Entering and Emerging ELLs  December 4th: NYC DOE's  Language Translation and Interpretation Unit: Best Practices  January 8th: Understanding language acquisition: Language and content objectives for history and ELA/math and science  February 5th: Understanding language acquisition: Language and content objectives for history and ELA  March 21:  Lesson planning for content and language development for ELLs  April 18:  Formative assessment for ELLs     ALL teachers will be involved in professional development on implementing the CCLS, and in particular on adapting course  materials, so that ELLs have access to grade level content information.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  School leadership and guidance support staff in assisting ELLs as they move from one school level to the next in the following  ways: 1) School staff receives lists of ELLs, their levels and schedules during the first two weeks of school. 2) Staff/ENL teachers  confer about needs of individual students.  3) Grade teams confer with each other on ways to help ELLs transition to the new  grade, e.g. with curricular or instructional modifications  4)  The guidance counselors receives PD on assisting ELLs as they  transition from middle to high school.    Our school provides professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the needs of  English language learners. A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers  prescribed by CR Part 80 is allotted to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and  integrating language and content instruction for English language learners. For all bilingual and English as a new language  teachers, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required professional development hours is dedicated to language  acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and  integrating language and content instruction for English language learners. These PDs take place during our mandated PD  hours.  ENL teachers attend PDs at the OELL in order to  fulfill the PD requirement as outlined in CR part 80.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents of ELLs are invited to attend an annual individual meeting to discuss the goals of the ENL program, the results of the  NYSESLAT/NYSITELL, student's progress in language development and the student's language development needs in all content  areas.  These visits take place before or after school. We ensure parents attend these meetings by sending them letters  describing their importance, and suggested dates. Parents can visit either Jennifer Miller or Louise Bausso (ENL teachers). We  use bilingual school personnel in Spanish and Arabic. With other languages we utilize the Department of Education's phone  interpretation service.  Content area and ENL teachers as well as support staff (guidance, social worker) attend  these  meetings.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents of ELLs participate in all aspects of the school.  Prior to the beginning of the school year, newly enrolled English  language learners and their parents are invited to a summer institute where they have the opportunity to meet with their  teachers, engage in curriculum exploration and become familiar with our school.  Furthermore, we hold two parent breakfasts  for our ELL parents, at which time they participate in workshops on how they can assist their children’s success in  school.  Parents are also encouraged to accompany their children on the ENL field trips in the spring.  The parent breakfasts are  a good forum for parents to find out about the workings of our school as well as how they can assist their children in  succeeding in their classes.             Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    At Park Slope Collegiate we collaborate with the Atlantic Theater Company, who works with general education classes that contain  many ELLs to teach them basic strategies of acting, with a culminating project that include writing and performing their own  plays.This partnership has dramatically bolstered students' confidence in terms of speaking and listening. As the majority of our  ELLs are Newcomers, the Atlantic Theater Company provides tools which help these students' confidence levels and in turn, allow  them to participate much more freely in their content area classes.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61                          As a small school we are very successful in terms of communicating about ELLs' varied needs and strategies which help them.  As a  staff we have identified the different needs of our ELLs, be they SIFE, newcomers, ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years, long-term ELLs  and former ELLs. We discuss these subgroups and ways to accelerate English language learning in the quickest way possible.      In our free-standing ENL classes students are explicitly taught a host of academic content/language skills which is needed  throughout the curriculum. This includes units on nutrition, persuasive writing, personal narrative, global and U.S. history.                 2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jill Bloomberg, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Park Slope Collegiate                                                                              School DBN: 15K464  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.
