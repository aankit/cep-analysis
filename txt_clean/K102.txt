This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our school mission is the belief that all children can achieve when provided with an interactive and challenging  program focused on the individual needs of our multicultural student population. We believe that the benefits of a  multicultural society can be realized when a collaboration exists between students, parents, teachers, administrators  and community. Our goal is to enhance student achievement in order to prepare our students for college and career  readiness.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P.S. 102 strongly believes in the importance of bridging school and community. This is accomplished by establishing  partnerships with local organizations. We also believe in developing students cultural experiences through the arts as  a result, our school is involved in many Project Arts Residencies such as:     The New York City Ballet “The Nutcracker Project”- Students in third and fourth grade engage in   interdisciplinary lessons that involve active art making, collaboration and critical reflection through poetry  and creative movement. All participants attend a live performance at Lincoln Center.     Brooklyn Queens Conservatory of Music, “Music Therapy Program” for our Visually Limited Students. This   program uses music as a therapeutic tool to help students with emotional, developmental and physical  disabilities improve their lives.   We participate in the CookShop Program which is a core nutritional education program of the Food Bank of New York  City. The CookShop classroom uses hands-on exploration and cooking activities to foster children’s enjoyment and  consumption of healthy foods as well as their appreciation for good nutrition. In addition to our work in the classroom  we have an active CookShop for families program which provide participants with simple, healthy recipes using fresh  affordable ingredients. CookShop for Families offers the skills and knowledge needed to make CookShop part of their  families’ daily lives.   We partner with the Brooklyn Public Library's Bay Ridge Branch to schedule class visits, participate in various  community activities and supports our screen free week each year during after school hours.   PwC (Price Waterhouse Coopers) Earn Your Future Program is another partnership that provides financial literacy  lessons to grade 2,3,4 and 5 with a take home for parent involvement.   Our school community has been committed to developing an award winning school garden and uses the garden as  nature’s classroom. The vegetables grown in the garden are used in our school kitchen to provide healthy meals and  reinforce the science of nutrition. The P.S.102 P.T.A. is priceless as they tirelessly give of their time and talents to run  and fund many engaging events during school hours, in the evenings ,as well as on the weekends to benefit the social,  emotional and academic needs of our students.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   P.S.102 has a large, multicultural/multilingual student population with approximately 1,420 students speaking more  than 30 languages. The most widely spoken languages are Arabic (17.3%) and Spanish (15.4%) which total 32.7% of  our student population. 52% of our student population come from homes where a language other than English is  spoken. Of this 52%, mandated English as a Second Language (ESL) students comprise 17.9%. To meet the needs of  this growing population, we have a NYSESLAT Saturday Academy program to provide the additional supports needed  for our ELL population which begins in October and runs through to the middle of May. Our ENL Department works  collaboratively with classroom teachers to engage in a Co-Teaching model during integrated service. In addition, our  parent coordinator conducts weekly English Conversation Classes for our parent community and makes available to  them a parent library throughout the school year.    Students who may be struggling are offered Academic Intervention Services in reading and/or math and we have  implemented a creative flexible program model that provides our student with a least restrictive environment.      To increase student engagement and inquiry based learning, we have begun our sixth year implementing the  S.T.E.M./S.T.E.A.M Program. In the 2014-2015 school year we implemented a robotics program after school to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      deepen the level of student thinking. Our Robotics teacher has attended extensive training and facilitated the  purchasing of IPads.      Reading Recovery is a program we value and it is our intention to continue to build capacity in this program each year.  We have partnered with the Reading Reform Foundation program for students in K-2 which utilizes the Orton- Gillingham methodology. We have built capacity each year since 2008 and have trained 2-4 classroom teachers each  year during the summer.      The Peer Buddy program helps students to build self-esteem by providing opportunities for upper class students to  peer-tutor, participate in arts-and crafts activities which foster social interactions with other students in the younger  grades.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   P.S. 102 has made progress in all six elements of the Framework for Great Schools as evidenced by our Quality Review  Report in 2014-2015 P.S. 102 received “Well Developed” ratings for each of the Quality Review indicators. According  to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide the elements in which PS 102 has made the most progress are Rigorous  Instruction and Strong Family-Community Ties.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40        Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P. S. 102, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the No Child  Left Behind (NCLB) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the  connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed  to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of  their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and  Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.

The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. In developing the Title I  Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the school’s Parent Association  (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the  proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input.   To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ●actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact   ●engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly  to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills   ●ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact   ●support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

As  of the 2018-2019 school year, PS 102 has a population of 1,432 students. According to the Home  Language Aggregation Report, 45% of the students speak a language other than English at home.  The main language groups include Arabic, Albanian, Chinese, Polish, Russian, Spanish, and  Urdu. Of these students, 13.7% are current English Language Learners (ELLs) receiving  mandated English Language Support Services.  In past years, the ENL team at PS 102 has used a teacher created curriculum for our Title III  After School and Saturday Academy programs that was aligned with topics presented in the  classroom.  All seven of our ENL teachers are trained in the multi-sensory Orton-Gillingham  instructional reading program, which has and will continue to be embedded into instruction  during the school day and during the Title III After School and Saturday Academy  programs.  Based on our 2017-2018 quantitative RLAT data, 33% of our ELLs reached  proficiency on the NYSESLAT. In addition, 27.6% of our ELLs moved up one or more  proficiency levels. While our NYSESLAT scores attest to the fact that our teachers were able to  modify instruction to fit the needs of our students, we believe the supplemental After School and  Saturday Academy programs utilizing National Geographic Reach will provide the boost needed  by the 22.9% of our students who remained on the same proficiency level.  Looking over our  quantitative data, we feel that a more concrete curriculum that integrates language development  with science and social studies themes would be a perfect fit for our student population and  would improve the English language development of both our struggling students as well as  those who are already making gains.  All seven of our licensed full time ENL teachers will be offered positions in the After School and  Saturday Academy programs. Teachers will also analyze NYSESLAT data and pair students  based on their performance in the four modalities of language listening, speaking, reading,  and writing. Teachers will create lessons that are aligned to specific needs of students in  accordance to the four language modalities. Students will be grouped based on their English  Proficiency levels. For each grade level there will be one ENL teacher  with 10-12 students at the  same English Proficiency level.  Teachers will create their own attendance sheets and ensure that  students are maintaining good attendance. Parent notifications will be send out in parents  preferred languages using the RAPL report in ATS. A list will also be given to each ENL teacher  and classroom teacher as well.   From a qualitative aspect, the ENL team at PS 102 has effective to highly effective ratings in  Component 2A of the Danielson Framework: Creating an Environment of Respect and  Rapport.  From this information, it can be inferred that the ENL students of PS 102 have  maintained low affective filters, an aspect of language learning known to be effective in  accelerating second language acquisition.  Furthermore, PS 102 events like the International Tea  and additional culture celebrations within the school community celebrate the diversity of the  students, improving student confidence and self-esteem in the classroom.  By using National  Geographic Reach, a program designed for ELLs that showcases cultural pluralism during Title  III After School and Saturday Academy program, our hope is to continue to maintain our  students' sense of comfort in the ENL classroom.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information     We will utilize the vertically aligned National Geographic Reach program in grades  Kindergarten through Fifth for our Title III After School and Saturday Academy programs.  The  materials utilized from National Geographic Reach will be supplemental and distinct from those  used for daily classroom instruction.  Title II After School and Saturday Academy instruction  will be provided in English and because the Reach program was designed for ELLs, native  language support as well as general language supports are provided throughout the curriculum.  Teachers will provide home language support by integrating reading material and mentor texts in  the student's home language, acquired using the ENL department's current subscription to  Reading A-Z.  Teachers will also include translations of key vocabulary and instructions during  each lesson.  In addition, home language dictionaries will be made available to use during Title  III After School and Saturday Academy time.  We chose to target grades K-5 because we believe  the program will benefit all of our ELLs in each grade, especially those struggling to improve  their English language proficiency and NYSESLAT scores. Additionally, PS 102 values early  intervention. With that being said, it would be advantageous to begin implementing the program  in kindergarten.  Continuing National Geographic Reach throughout the subsequent grades  would be beneficial to our school’s ELLs in order to provide continuity and familiarity  throughout the grades. After students complete one year of the program and progress to the next  grade, they will study the next National Geographic Reach leveled program in the following  grade. We expect the continuation of the program to foster student growth in all modalities.  Furthermore, implementing Reach for all grade levels will provide consistency and familiarity  for the students. As they advance to the next grade, they will know what to expect and will  become familiar with the program in their After School and Saturday Academy programs.  Having past experience with Reach will likely help students continue to succeed in the  subsequent years to follow.

Each teacher will have access to the various programs, materials, reading  book, and worksheets that are available within the subscription. Teachers will gather and choose  materials based on their students needs and English Proficiency levels. For the past year, our  ENL team all sit as members of the PS 102 Inquiry Team. The Inquiry team has solely focused  on incorporating vocabulary into classroom instruction creating strategies that meet their  students needs.  These strategies and methodologies have been implemented into classrooms  during integrated instruction.   Students will be selected to participate in a given session of After School or Saturday Academy  based on their scores on the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT. There will be an  Entering/Emerging After School group, a Transitioning/Expanding After School group, and then  in the spring an intensive NYSESLAT test prep group that will be offered to the students at the  high level of Expanding. We will also implement a Newcomer After School group based on the  needs of the students in grades 3-5. During the Fall and Spring terms, we plan to invite 10  students per teacher, for a total of 40 students per term, to participate in the Title III After School  Reach program. The grades served in this program will be K-3. Ten students per teacher, for a  total of 20 students per term, will be invited to participate in the Fall and Spring Reach Saturday  Academy sessions as well. Fourth and Fifth grades will be served during the Fall and Spring  Saturday Academy sessions. We plan to invite 10-12 students per teacher per term. Each teacher  will have a subscription to Raz-Plus ELL Edition, Vocabulary A-z, and Writing A-Z. One  hundred and twenty total ELLs will be serviced through the Title III After School and Saturday  Academy programs.

During the mandated Professional Development time from 2:40-4:00 on Mondays, the seven  certified ENL teachers who will be participating in the Title III program (Ms. Angelakos, Ms.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         Part C: Professional Development   Maloney, Ms. Poulon, Ms. Sharfeldin, Ms. Wilkinson,  Ms. Zaccone, and Mr. Kearns) will  collaborate and engage in professional development as a team. Teachers will turn-key  information gathered from previous professional development.   In addition, National Geographic Learning provides ongoing professional learning for educators  who use National Geographic Reach through the use of author podcasts.  Through the podcasts,  Reach authors present best-practices in teaching based on current research focusing on listening,  reading, writing, speaking and content instruction through Reach.  The six certified ENL teachers  will listen to the author podcasts on a monthly basis in order to develop teaching practices and  support student learning through the program. This PD will count toward the required 50% of  professional development hours that must be dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with  content area instruction. This additional on-going professional development will be administered  at no cost to Title III funding.  In order to maintain records, ENL teachers will sign in and be  given an agenda that outlines the objective of the author's podcast obtained from the National  Geographic Reach website.  This sign-in sheet will be kept in an ENL binder in the ENL  department office.   Aside from the professional development provided by National Geographic Learning, the Title  III ENL teachers will also attend professional development provided by the Brooklyn South  Borough Field Support Center. The professional development offered is aligned to the New  Language Arts Progressions for ELLs. When we attended the provided professional development  sessions during the 2017-2018 academic year, we found them to be useful in providing strategies  for teaching ELLs. We learned valuable strategies that were successfully implemented in our  ENL classrooms. In the upcoming school year, the teachers participating in the Title III program  will continue to attend the PD offered by Brooklyn South and the information learned will be  incorporated into our instruction in the Title III program.  ENL teachers will retain all agendas  from professional development sessions attended in order to maintain records.     All professional development will be provided at no cost to Title III funding.

This will be an introductory presentation for parents to meet with  the ENL teachers and to preview the program dates and times, and the curriculum that will be  utilized throughout the After School cycle. A cumulative project will be discussed, as well as the  texts and workbooks the students will use. We will also showcase the E-resources provided by  National Geographic. Parents will be shown the National Geographic website on the Smartboard  to illustrate how to utilize the resources for varying levels of English Language Learners.

Sign-in sheets will be kept in a binder in the ENL office in order to maintain  records.  The four modalities assessed will be explained to the parents with examples of test  questions and tips to help their children do their best on the day of the test. Translators will be  provided as needed and invitations will be sent home in native languages as well as English so  that families are aware of the opportunity.    Also in March, the ENL department will be hosting an International Celebration for ENL  students to share an artifact, a dance, a song, or traditional clothing that embodies their culture or  language. Parents, teachers, and the community are welcome to join us for an afternoon  performance. Parents and the P.T.A will bring in homemade dishes in a potluck style buffet to  share cultural food and snacks. The ENL teachers or classroom teachers will choose students  who feel comfortable sharing their culture to perform. In order to notify parents and community  members of the International Celebration, both translated and English versions of the notices will  be sent home.    In May, an End Term presentation from the After School program will take place to celebrate  and showcase student projects. The ENL teachers will share data and success stories from the  cycle. In order to notify parents of the workshop, both translated and English versions of the  notices will be sent home. Translators will be provided as needed at the presentation.    Our parent coordinator, Ms. Sheri, is another valuable resource for all of our parents and  guardians, including ELL parents. In addition to the Parent ESL class she offers on Mondays, she  organizes the Learning Leaders program, which provides tutoring for our struggling students,  including ELLs.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?                   Students in Kindergarten through Second grade, including ELLs, are assessed using teacher-created assessments with  checklists to monitor the acquisition of concepts of print and other early literacy skills such as phonemic awareness, alphabet  knowledge, high frequency words, rhyming, syllabication, phonics, blending, and segmenting.  Teachers perform running  records on a regular basis to assess student reading levels and form guided reading groups.           In the stand-alone ENL setting, the early literacy skills of our Entering and Emerging students are assessed using the  Informal Phonics Inventory from Assessment for Reading Instruction, Fry Sight Words Inventories, running records, the Words  Their Way Elementary Spelling Inventory for ELLs or the Picture Spelling Inventory if more appropriate, in addition  timed  readings to assess fluency and teacher-created assessments designed to mirror the Orton-Gillingham lessons taught up until   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      that point.  Performing these assessments on a regular basis guides ENL teachers' instructional planning to determine  students’ weaknesses and areas of accomplishment in order to improve ENL students reading and writing skills.            In order to periodically assess reading benchmarks throughout the school year, classroom teachers in Kindergarten  through grade five use the Fountas & Pinnel kits.  Additionally, in order to assess students’ reading comprehension and writing  skills, classroom teachers utilize the formative assessments provided by the ReadyGen curriculum that are aligned with the  corresponding unit of study.  ReadyGen performance task writing pieces also provide insight as to which areas of the writing  process students need improvement.           For the 2017-2018 school year, PS 102’s Inquiry team study was focused on the following objective: "Using non-fiction  text, how can we implement scaffolds and supports within our literacy program to positively impact the ELA performance of  our English Language Learners?" For grades Kindergarten through Second grade, it was decided that our ELLs greatest area of  need was the development of their vocabulary.  Teachers determined that area of focus based on the previous years writing  assignments and the types of vocabulary demanded of students by the ReadyGen literacy curriculum.           For grades three through five, teachers used the Title III EDAT tool to determine the types of questions that ELLs  performed the lowest on for the 2016 NYS ELA exam.  The team then decided to focus on that grade during inquiry study on  further developing those skills.  In grades three and five, the inquiry team focused on developing ELL’s use of academic  vocabulary.  In grade four, the inquiry team focused on improving student understanding of text features and interpretation of  graphics.           For kindergarten through second grade, pre, mid and final assessments were developed by ENL teachers to mirror the  NYSITELL/NYSESLAT exams.  Weekly, research-based scaffolds and graphic organizers deemed beneficial to the development  of student vocabulary which were used by classroom teachers to assess their ELLs vocabulary development and  understanding.    Based on the areas of focus determined from the EDAT tool teachers of grades three through five developed formative  assessments with questions aligned to the New York State ELA exam that would assess all students, but specifically ELLs, in  those areas of weakness determined by the Inquiry team.  A pre-assessment, midterm assessment and final assessment were  all administered, as well as weekly or bi-weekly mini-assessments throughout the time of study. The results of these  assessments informed teachers as to their ELLs understanding and ability to use academic vocabulary or answer questions  about text features/graphics and assisted teachers to determine the types of scaffolds needed in order to assist ELLs in the  growth of these skills.                   2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?              Our ELLs current reading levels inform our instructional planning.  In the integrated setting, our students are in guided  reading groups that are frequently regrouped in order to reflect the students’ progress and address their specific skills and  needs. In the stand-alone setting, our students are provided explicit reading instruction that includes Orton-Gillingham to  provide strong foundational reading and writing skills.  The results of the grade assessments developed by the Inquiry Team  guide the Inquiry Team’s research to find scaffolds and supports that teachers implement in order to advance the ELLs in those  areas of focus.  Various research-based strategies and graphic organizers are utilized for each grade that will assist students in  the development of the skills determined as their grade focus.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?                  There are multiple and varying baseline/benchmark assessments that are used in our school. The ReadyGen curriculum  provides Performance Tasks that assess reading comprehension and are administered at the end of each unit.  The Orton- Gillingham phonics program also provides a pre and post assessment for prior knowledge and newly acquired knowledge.  Classroom teachers administer Fountas & Pinnel reading level assessments to monitor movement among leveled independent  reading. The Fountas & Pinnel administration is typically at the beginning, mid, and end of the school year, but can be  administered informally if the classroom teacher deems fit.  Throughout the school year there are ELL periodic assessments  designed to mirror the format of the reading, writing and listening portions of the NYSESLAT. The assessments provide timely,  detailed data about the students’ strengths and weaknesses in the modalities assessed and then the data is used by ENL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      teachers, as well as classroom teachers in order to plan individual and small group instruction.           When students enter our school as per CR Part 154 the following procedure is in place by our ENL pedagogues:  the  administration of the HLIS, parent/student informal interview and student screener. If it is determined the OTELLE code is  other than English and the student is limited English after the informal interview/screener the NYSITELL exam is administered.  This will  provide insight as to the student's strengths and weaknesses in the four language  modalities and identify their  English proficiency level. At the end of the school year April-May the NYSESLAT is administered and therefore the data from  the exam provides teachers with the summative assessment of the students’ progress made and their updated English  language proficiency across the four modalities. These two state assessments act as markers for initial incoming English  language proficiency levels and determine the progress made throughout the school year.            4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         Once the summative data has been collected, ENL teachers and classroom teachers collaborate in order to parallel teach  lessons aligned to Common Core Language Standards. They target students’ needs based on the summative data. The ENL  teachers also reinforce the instruction in the Stand-alone setting. In addition, ENL teachers use data collected from the Orton- Gillingham assessment to lead small groups in OG instruction, which is a multisensory reading program designed to help  struggling readers. Classroom teachers as well as ENL teachers also utilize guided reading to support students’ reading. During  guided reading many skills are taught  such as, main idea, sequencing, text features, vocabulary, etc. Providing effective  structures in the classroom enhances student learning. The proficiency levels provided by the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT provide  both the ENL and classroom teachers the framework to differentiate instruction by referencing The New Language Arts  Bilingual Progressions to each  language  proficiency level and skills being taught in the integrated ENL classroom setting.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]                PS 102 has an active School Assessment Team (SAT). Classroom teachers are encouraged to recommend any students who  are struggling either emotionally or academically to the SAT for discussion so that the best possible setting and services can be  provided for students in need. The SAT meeting consists of the school psychologist, the social worker, an IEP teacher, the  child’s assistant principal, as well as the child’s classroom teachers and any current service providers, such as an ENL teacher or  speech teacher. At meetings, all adults with knowledge of the child are encouraged to contribute observations and data  generated during instruction so that a multi faceted description of the child can be obtained. Once a recommendation is made  for a child and implemented for the determined amount of time, a subsequent meeting is convened to discuss student  progress and the possible need for further action.        The current RTI program consists of Tier I instruction provided in the form of quality, differentiated instruction for all  students in the general education setting provided by a qualified classroom teacher,  Tier II intervention provided in small  group or integrated settings by grade-specific reading specialists or teachers with many years of classroom experience, and  Tier III intervention is provided in a stand alone setting for groups of one to three students by the same teachers who provide  Tier II intervention.        There are numerous intervention strategies and programs in place that meet the needs of multiple populations of students.  They are designed to provide enrichment to advanced learners as well as support to learners who are experiencing difficulties.  The Delta Program is designed for gifted students. Students are tested for admission and challenged with beyond grade-level  curriculum in a self-contained format. There are self-contained classrooms that consist of a teacher and 12 students for  students with special needs that requires small class size according to their IEP. This small class provides students with the  teacher support and intervention that they need depending on their specific disability. PS 102 provides this classroom  environment for students who require a smaller class to reach academic, social and emotional success. Additionally, in the  Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) classrooms provided at each grade level, students with disabilities are educated alongside age- appropriate peers. This model provides a setting where special education students can receive the same curriculum as the  other students at their grade level while still receiving the specialized support of a special education teacher. Still other  students receive part-time special education services with a SETSS teacher (Special Education Teacher Support Services) in a  small group setting. Academic Intervention Services (AIS) are available for students in all grades who are struggling with  reading acquisition. Because of the small-group nature of the classes, AIS teachers are able to group students based on their  needs and tailor instruction accordingly to fundamentals or strategies. Tier two and three Response to Intervention (RTI)   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65         services are provided in this way. Reading Recovery is provided for struggling first graders. Students are pulled out of the class  and receive additional reading support using the Reading Recovery model. First graders go through the Reading Recovery  intervention for a specific number of weeks and then teachers evaluate whether the program can be terminated or whether  students need to continue with the program. Other services provided within the school include ENL for eligible students whose  home language is one other than English as well as speech for students with speech and language disabilities. These services  are provided in both integrated and stand-alone settings depending on the needs of the individual students being serviced.  Stand-alone services range from targeted small group instruction to one-on-one settings with a specially trained teacher so  that students can receive the support they need to develop their language skills.           6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].           Yearly, the classroom and content area teachers of ELLs at PS 102 use the aggregated EDAT tool and the RLAT from  ATS  data  to evaluate and formulate the ELL program. Students are grouped according to their Targets of Measurement based  on the RLAT report generated in ATS for ENL classes, so that instruction can be targeted to each subgroup’s specific needs  according to the Performance Level Descriptions for each modality and grade. Specific data from the ELL Data Analysis Tool for  each subgroup (Newcomers, Long—term ELLs, SWD ELLs, SIFE and former ELLs) and data from the ELA and Math Tests are  used for grades three through five to make informed decisions in the placement and programming for each ENL student.              7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?         Teachers of Kindergarten through grade five review formative and summative assessments and the ELL Data and EDAT  formulate lessons based on their findings. Teachers sit during Inquiry time and make adjustments to their program with  information gathered from the data. Each teacher lists the names of students and areas in need of improvement. Small group  instruction is then implemented with lessons that are geared towards specific academic skills (main idea, sequencing, problem  and solution). Each teacher makes adjustments as necessary to fit their student’s needs. ENL teachers collaborate with  classroom teachers during common planning time to align their integrated and stand-alone instruction with similar  adjustments.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.         Our freestanding English as a New Language (ENL) program provides instruction in English with native language  supports using research-based strategies known to be effective in accelerating language acquisition. Our ENL teachers  use both integrated and stand-alone models in accordance with the mandates established in CR Part 154.2.  Entering  and Emerging level ELLs receive 180 minutes each of stand-alone and integrated ENL. Transitioning and Expanding  level ELLs receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL and Commanding level former ELLs receive 90 minutes of integrated  ENL. Stand-alone ENL groups, consisting only of Entering and Emerging level students, are organized by grade level  with most students in groups with only students from their particular grade level. In situations where numbers do not  allow grade-specific stand-alone groups, students are placed in groups with other students from only two contiguous  grades. Stand-alone ENL classes are taught by certified ENL teachers. Integrated ENL for Entering, Emerging,  Transitioning, and Expanding level ELLs is delivered by a content area teacher and a certified ENL teacher in a co- teaching model using ENL strategies to accelerate English language development as well as the development of  content area knowledge. Integrated ENL for Commanding level former ELLs is delivered by both a content area   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         teacher and a certified ENL teacher in a co-teaching model, as well as by a dually certified teacher in a cluster  setting.                  b.  TBE program.  If applicable.         For the  2017-2018 school year, PS 102  offered a Spanish Transitional Bilingual program. After holding parent  meetings discussing the the TBE program along with the other programs offered, PS 102 did not have the sufficient  numbers to keep the Spanish TBE Program open therefore the class was dismantled.  Ms. DiSomma, will continue to  incorporate Spanish language support within her lessons and use the Bilingual Language Progressions to drive  instruction.     Ms. DiSomma will utilize the Ready Gen Common Core literacy curriculum in conjunction will various bilingual  resources in the classroom.  Home Language Arts will be incorporated as the teacher will be trained in the Orton-  Gillingham phonics program and will incorporate aspects of this program in English with support in Spanish.       Summative and formative assessments will be used throughout the school year as a guide to help the teacher  assess the progress of each student.  Differentiation will be included in all lessons to engage all learners emerged in  the classroom. All lessons will be aligned to the New York State Common Core Learning Standards in conjunction with  the Bilingual Language Progressions.      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A     2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?           In accordance with the mandates established in CR Part 154.2, Entering and Emerging level ELLs receive 180 minutes of  Stand-alone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL for a total of 360 minutes of service per week. Transitioning and  Expanding level ELLs receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL and Commanding level former ELLs receive 90 minutes of  integrated ENL. 180 of the minutes of Intergrated ENL service for Entering, Emerging and Transitioning level students will be  provided during the ELA block of instruction.  The ENL teachers ensure their schedules provide the mandated number of  minutes in the appropriate instructional setting for each student on their roster.  We ensure we are in compliance with ENL  mandates by inputting these instructional times into the STARS Classroom and updating our roster as new students are  admitted to the school.   Teachers are mindful to provide the mandated minutes during the integrated literacy block. Teachers enhance their lessons  with various scaffolds for example native language texts, visuals, and dictionaries. When teachers are delivering the Stand- Alone model, they align their lessons with the material covered within each classroom. According to the students proficiency  levels, the teacher differentiates her instruction to meet the language needs of each individual student.                    3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.          In the integrated ENL setting, ENL teachers assist classroom teachers in all aspects of the core content delivered  in the  classroom with the addition of ENL specific strategies such as the use of primary language support in the form of bilingual  dictionaries, online translations, visual technology including language settings on the computer for research purposes, and  peer-to-peer support, visuals, gestures, manipulatives, realia, technology, videos, TPR, increased frequency of specific  feedback, language frames, encouraging non-verbal responses and other strategies in a low risk, supportive environment. PS  102 uses Pearson’s ReadyGen program for English Language Arts (ELA) instruction in kindergarten through fifth grade in the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      integrated ENL setting. The program provides thematic units of study incorporating authentic, Common Core aligned fiction  and non-fiction texts. Throughout the program, students are taught to answer higher-order thinking questions, analyze texts  and incorporate text-based evidence to support their views, perform close reading in order to pay particular attention to the  language and structures the author used in writing the text, and integrate information gained from a variety of sources.  Because the work done using the ReadyGen program is comprehension based, all classroom teachers with the assistance of  ENL teachers in the integrated ENL setting, also utilize guided reading to address the strategies and processes involved in  becoming a proficient reader. In guided reading, students are placed in ability groups so teachers can target necessary skills to  augment the students’ reading abilities. Teachers typically aim to work with each reading group one day per week using  appropriately leveled books.            Additionally, in the integrated ENL setting, ENL teachers utilize the New Language Arts (NLA) Bilingual Progressions when  working with ELLs of varying proficiency levels in order to provide access points to the grade level content and standards  expected in the classroom.  The strategies and scaffolds provided by the NLA Bilingual Progressions provide teachers with the  expectations of ELLs at each proficiency level according to the Common Core standards aligned to each skill and grade..    In the integrated ENL setting, modified versions of the writing activities provided in the ReadyGen program are utilized to work  on the students’ ability to produce on demand writing, which is often used on standardized tests. ENL teachers also utilize the  NLA Bilingual Progressions during writing activities in order to assist varying leveled ELLs and  accessing the grade level writing  standards of their classroom.         In order to address the writing process, teachers use the writer’s workshop model where students are guided through the  process of brainstorming ideas, drafting, revising, editing, and publishing written works. This is paired with individual teacher  conferences and peer evaluations using child-friendly or class-generated rubrics. In the integrated ENL setting, ENL teachers  are available to segment the steps in the writing process for those ELLs who may need additional support and modeling. In  order for ENL students to contribute to academic class discussions, ENL and classroom teachers provide sentence frames and  model the use of academic language in a discussion format.  This provides ENL students with a native English language model  to confidently emulate.             In Kindergarten and First grade, teachers use Reading Reform and or Orton-Gillingham methods to teach phonics. Both  programs teach the alphabet and the sounds associated with each letter, as well as blends, digraphs, and vowel teams.  Spelling rules and syllabication are taught to assist with encoding and decoding. Both programs follow a systematic  progression of sounds to be introduced to students so that they are only responsible for what they have been taught.  Furthermore, grammar, sentence structure, and English writing conventions are taught through sentence dictation and  connected, decodable texts are used to reinforce the sound or pattern taught that day and practice fluency. Upper grade  students requiring instruction in reading and writing fundamentals receive such instruction in small group settings such as in  stand-alone ENL or AIS or with the ENL teacher in the integrated ENL setting.           Our stand-alone ENL program provides high quality, intensive and consistent English language and content area  instruction aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards for Entering and Emerging level students. Stand-alone ENL  teachers align ENL instruction to the grade-level literacy curriculum in order to support and reinforce the targeted literacy  skills in the classroom. Our goal is to provide a rich language learning environment that incorporates the four language  modalities (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) while developing language and academic skills in literacy and the content  areas so that our ELL students can begin to work independently in the classroom.  We strive to expose ELLs to meaningful  language and literacy experiences through interactive activities, with a focus on teaching the necessary higher-order thinking  skills. In a low-anxiety learning environment, our ELLs are encouraged to take risks and actively participate in scaffolded  language-learning so that they become independent learners and achieve grade-level standards in all areas. Additionally,  fundamental reading and writing skills are taught in the stand-alone ENL classroom using Orton-Gillingham, Fluency Oriented  Reading Instruction (FORI), repeated reading, wide reading, timed reading and other approaches.                    4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?    When our students are initially tested with the NYSITELL, our eligible ELLs who speak Spanish are given the Spanish LAB to  assess native language skills as well as to determine language dominance. We use information gained during the registration  process to determine native language skills and the  formal education history of the students.  Additionally, we interview the  upper-grade ELL students to assess if they are able to use bilingual dictionaries and word-to-word glossaries to aid them in  their language development. We also train the students to use the word-to-word glossaries if they have native language  literacy skills as their use is an allowable accommodation on NYS standardized exams.                                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.                           Based on the revised language of the criteria for determining SIFE status, which states that a SIFE student is an  Entering or Emerging level ELL enrolling in the ELSS in Third through Fifth grades with inconsistent or  interrupted schooling  prior to arrival in the United States and/or evidence of being two or more years below grade level in their home language or  mathematics.  This information is supported by documentation from the administration of the SIFE questionnaire and the LENS  assessment. It is likely that a significant portion of the upper grade ELLs enrolling at our school will qualify for SIFE status due  to these requirements. This subgroup of students will participate in our stand-alone and integrated ENL classes, or in a  bilingual or dual setting if numbers generated from the Parent Selection Form warrant the opening of such a program. SIFE  students will be paired with a Learning Leader who shares the same language background for additional academic, language  and emotional support.  All opportunities to participate in additional programs such as AIS, extended day small group  instruction, and any available Title III After-School or Saturday programs will be extended to SIFE students.                  Newcomer ELLs participate in our freestanding ENL program. They are placed in grade-appropriate groups and  receive the mandated number of periods according to their English proficiency level.  They are often teamed with a Learning  Leader who provides additional tutoring and academic support in a 1:1 or small group setting. We make every effort to assign  Learning Leaders who share the same native language background as our newcomer ELLs to provide additional academic,  language, and emotional support. Classroom teachers in Kindergarten through Second grade have set up listening centers to  give students an opportunity to listen to and follow along with story selections. There are also English Language Learning  Centers in each classroom with various hands-on learning kits to encourage language development and reinforce language and  phonics skills. Additionally, they are invited to participate in the Title III After-school Enrichment program that is staffed by a  certified ENL teacher. ELLs in grades three through five work in small groups to reinforce English language skills as well as  develop the literacy and content area skills required to succeed on the standardized NYSESLAT, ELA and math state exams.  They are also invited to participate in our Title III Saturday ELL Academy later in the school year that focuses on developing  listening, speaking, reading and writing skills to prepare for the upcoming NYSESLAT.  Our newcomer ELLs in the upper grades  are also invited to attend the Title III ELL Academy for ELA/Math that focuses on developing reading and math skills and  provides additional opportunities to practice for the state exams in a small group setting.                  Developing ELLs who are receiving services for four to six years participate in our freestanding ENL program.  Students  are placed in grade-appropriate groups and receive the mandated number of periods in the appropriate setting, integrated,  stand-alone, or a combination of the two models, according to their proficiency level. They may also receive small group  instruction from our AIS providers where lesson plans are designed to strengthen their literacy, math, and content area skills.  Classroom teachers have set up listening centers  to give students an opportunity to listen to and follow along with story  selections providing additional opportunities for ELLs to hear a native speaker reading aloud. There are also English Language  Learning Centers in each classroom with various hands-on learning kits to encourage language development and reinforce  language and phonics skills. They may also attend the Title III After-school Enrichment program where ELLs from grades 3  through 5 work in small groups to reinforce English language skills as well as develop the literacy and content area skills  required to succeed on the standardized NYSESLAT, ELA and math state exams.  Our ELLs who have been receiving services for  four to six years are also invited to participate in our Title III Saturday ELL Academy later in the school year that focuses on  developing listening, speaking, reading and writing skills to prepare for the upcoming NYSESLAT. Students are also invited to  attend the Title III ELL Academy for ELA/Math that focuses on developing skills and providing opportunities to practice for the  state exams in a small group setting. Students may be teamed up with a Learning Leader who provides additional tutoring and  academic support in a 1:1 or small group setting. Additionally, our ELL students are provided with the allowable testing  accommodations such as the use of glossaries and extra time for the NYS ELA, Math, and content area exams. When  appropriate, we also ask the School Assessment Team to provide additional expertise and guidance to assist our ELLs in their  academic and social progress. In some instances, some ELLs with extended years of service are evaluated by School  Assessment Team and the results indicate a need for mandated services such as an IEP teacher, speech services or an   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      alternative setting.                  Long-Term ELLs participate in our freestanding ENL program in a grade-appropriate group  geared toward their  proficiency level and received the mandated number of minutes of ENL instruction. All opportunities to participate in  additional programs such as AIS, extended day small group instruction, and any available Title III After-School or Saturday  programs are extended to Long-Term ELLs.                  Former ELLs receive support in the integrated ENL setting for two years after reaching proficiency in English as per the  NYSESLAT. Service is delivered in a co-teaching or cluster setting.              6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?               Our special education ELLs in self-contained and integrated co-teaching classes participate in our freestanding ENL  program.  Students are placed in grade-appropriate groups and receive the mandated number of periods of instruction in the  appropriate setting, Stand-alone or integrated, according to their proficiency level determined by the NYSITELL or the  NYSESLAT. The ELL teachers have been trained in Orton- Gillingham and utilize this language-based program in order to  provide multi-sensory literacy to students with possible learning disabilities.  Our ELL Students With Disabilities (SWD) in the  self-contained classes use common core aligned grade level appropriate texts with additional scaffolds and supports in place.  Classroom teachers have also set up listening centers to give students an opportunity to listen to and follow along with story  selections. There are also English Language Learning Centers in each classroom with various hands-on learning kits to  encourage language development and reinforce language and phonics skills. Our ELL-SWDs also receive all services and  modifications indicated on their IEPs, including speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and specified testing  accommodations. They may also have a bilingual paraprofessional assigned to them to further assist and support them in their  academic work. Students with a bilingual paraprofessional have been placed in a self-contained or ICT class until a bilingual  self-contained or ICT program becomes available. Students may participate in small group instruction focused on developing  their literacy, math and content area skills during the extended day session with their classroom teacher.  In addition, they are  invited to attend the Title III After-school Enrichment program where ELLs from grades three through five work in small groups  to reinforce English language skills as well as develop the literacy and content area skills required to succeed on the  standardized NYSESLAT, ELA and math state exams. ELL-SWDs in the upper grades are also invited to participate in our Title III  Saturday ELL Academy later in the school year that focuses on developing listening, speaking, reading and writing skills to  prepare for the upcoming NYSESLAT.  They are also invited to attend the Title III ELL Academy for ELA/Math that focuses on  developing reading and math skills and provides additional opportunities to practice for the state exams in a small group  setting. Furthermore, students may be teamed up with a Learning Leader who provides additional tutoring and academic  support in a 1:1 or small group setting.                       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?       Our entire staff strives to ensure that all our students receive a high quality education geared toward their individualized  learning needs in the least restrictive environment possible. Our school aligns schedules on each grade to facilitate the use of  the Response to Invervention (RTI) structure in our classrooms. Response to Intervention involves the incorporation of  research-based instruction and interventions, regular monitoring of progress, and the use of data to make educational  decisions. In order to meet the needs of all our students, programming and planning aligns with Universal Design for Learning  principles which provide multiple entry points into instruction and learning activities. We are also implementing a Special  Education flexible scheduling initiative in grades three through five, when appropriate, in order to provide students access to  grade level curriculum in the least restrictive setting possible. With flexible scheduling, it is when  a student’s IEP calls for 12:1  instruction in reading and/or math only, those courses are taught with a special education teacher in a small group  environment whereas for the remainder of the day, the students are placed in general education classes for courses without  an IEP mandated smaller class size. Our ELLs in grades Kindergarten through Fifth grade who are placed in special education  classes (ICT or self-contained) continue to receive ELL services as well as other services as per their IEPs.                     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70            There are numerous intervention strategies and programs in place that meet the needs of multiple populations of students.  They are designed to provide enrichment to advanced learners as well as support to learners who are experiencing difficulties.  The Delta Program is designed for gifted students. Students are tested for admission and challenged with beyond grade-level  curriculum in a self-contained format. There are self-contained classrooms that consist of a teacher and 12 students for  students with special needs that requires small class size according to their IEP. This small class provides students with the  teacher support and intervention that they need depending on their specific disability. PS 102 provides this classroom  environment for students who require a smaller class to reach academic, social and emotional success. Additionally, in the  Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) classrooms provided at each grade level, students with disabilities are educated alongside age- appropriate peers. This model provides a setting where special education students can receive the same curriculum as the  other students at their grade level while still receiving the specialized support of a special education teacher. Still other  students receive part-time special education services with a SETSS teacher (Special Education Teacher Support Services) in a  small group setting. Academic Intervention Services (AIS) are available for students in all grades who are struggling with  reading acquisition. Due to the small-group nature of the classes, AIS teachers are able to group students based on their needs  and tailor instruction accordingly to fundamentals or strategies. Tier two and three Response to Intervention (RTI) services are  provided in this way. Reading Recovery is provided for struggling first graders. Students are pulled out of the class and receive  additional reading support using the Reading Recovery model. First graders go through the Reading Recovery intervention for  a specific number of weeks and then teachers evaluate whether the program can be terminated or whether students need to  continue with the program. Other services provided within the school include ENL for elligible students whose home language  is one other than English as well as speech for students with speech and language disabilities. These services are provided in  both integrated and Stand-alone settings depending on the needs of the individual students being serviced. Stand-alone  services range from targeted small group instruction to one-on-one settings with a specially trained teacher so that students  can receive the support they need to develop their language skills.           9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?               Based on data and trends, we have found that we have large subgroups of newcomer ELLs and ELLs with disabilities.  Due to  this finding, each ENL teacher will have an ENL RTI period embedded within their schedule. This period will be designed to  work with specific subgroups of students in a small group setting to meet their individual needs. Through informal assessments  and student observations, the students will be chosen by ENL teachers based on their current needs and abilities.   The  students participating in the ENL RTI group will be assessed and revolved based on a cyclical 4-6 week rotation.        Contingent upon funding, we will also implement after school and Saturday programs targeting students’ needs based on  the data collected from formative and summative grade level assessments. The program will be designed to meet the needs of  varying proficiency levels of ELLs to assist in enriching their skills in the common core content areas as well the four modalities  presented on the NYSESLAT.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?                 In the 2016-2017 school year, PS 102 opened a Kindergarten Spanish Transitional Bilingual Program. After holding several  ELL parent orientation meetings and reviewing Parent Selection Surveys, our numbers did not meet the criteria to have the  TBE program remain open. For the 2017-2018 school year we will be again offering the TBE program in hopes that parents  choose that program for their child.          To ensure parents of ELLs understand the various programs offered, translated notices are sent home and phone calls are  made in in the native language using bilingual paraprofessionals, teachers, and parents.  Our parent coordinator makes every  effort to reach out to all parents in our learning community to provide them with the information they need to ensure their  children have access to all school programs as well as the tools they need to help their children succeed academically.              11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.              All of our English Language Learners are afforded equal access to all school programs. Depending on the enrichment  programs offered to each grade, students may participate in computer, fine arts, drama, recorder, Cook Shop Classroom, and  Project Arts during the school day. All upper grade students are invited to participate in opera and chorus presenting an annual   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71      performance for the school community. The Multicultural Tea presents an opportunity for students on all grade levels to share  a song or dance important to their culture. The annual talent show is another opportunity for all students to perform for the  school community. During our afterschool program, students may be invited to participate in book making, guitar, flag football,  basketball, tennis, band or chess depending on grade level offerings.           For additional small group instruction in literacy, math, and content areas, ELLs participate in Title III ELL Afterschool  Programs and the Title III ELL Saturday Academy where students are afforded additional time to practice their listening,  speaking, reading and writing skills. When summer school programs are available, our ELLs are invited to participate for  additional enrichment and English language exposure.  Many of our ELLs participate in the PS 102 One World After School Program, operated by Heartshare Human Services of NY,  where many students continue their learning day.              Additionally, ELLs are offered the Gifted and Talented placement exam in their native language to provide them with an  equal opportunity to be placed into our Delta program.                12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.         PS 102 has mobile laptop stations available on each floor of the school. Students use the laptops to conduct research and  type their writing pieces for publication. The computer cluster teacher aligns his lessons with the content the students are  learning during their ELA block, which helps to infuse additional technology into the reading and writing curriculum.  Furthermore, each classroom has a SmartBoard and teachers typically use videos and other online resources to provide  students with additional entry points into the curriculum. In order to share and evaluate student work samples as a class, all  classrooms also have document cameras that allow all students in the class to see the actual writing piece a given student is  sharing so that ideas, grammar, and conventions of writing can be more clearly noticed and commented upon.              13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?             In the ENL setting, home language support is delivered through the use of bilingual dictionaries, online translations, visual  technology including language settings on the computer for research purposes,  peer-to-peer support, bilingual Learning  Leaders, and teaching cognates when appropriate.             Mentor and guided texts are ordered in students’ home languages and kept in an ENL library in classrooms.  These texts  are used for instructional purposes to help students with academic vocabulary and activating prior knowledge.  These texts are  related to the topics discussed in the monthly ReadyGen units.          14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.                  Our ENL staff continues to use a variety of materials and resources to provide our ELLs with an engaging, rigorous  language learning experience which meets the demands of the Common Core State Standards. Such programs as National  Geographic's REACH Program, Pearson’s ReadyGen, and Orton-Gillingham are utilized in creating lessons that support CCSS  and current skills/themes in the classrooms. Additionally, the ENL teachers make use of class-generated charts to be used as  references for writing, explicit vocabulary cards posted in classrooms that reflect content area vocabulary, sentence frames,  writing prompts, speaking prompts, big books to model explicit reading skills, short video clips to scaffold vocabulary or  specific content area knowledge, large photos used for academic language development in speaking and writing, as well as  graphic organizers to model writing tasks and reading comprehension.           For the 2018-2019 school year, the National Geographic REACH program  will be implemented in our stand-alone model  of ENL instruction.  Teachers will align the content of the REACH program to the appropriate grade level content being learned  in the classroom.  The REACH program provides supports for all levels of ELLs and differentiates instruction for all English  proficiency levels.  National Geographic REACH is cross curricular and can be utilized in all content areas to support ELLs.            Technology is used to augment our ELLs’ exposure to content based language. The technology cluster teacher uses the  Award computer-based program on the SmartBoard exposing kindergarten students to interactive phonics lessons.   The  National Geographic REACH program also provides technological supports to expand ELLs exposure to new vocabulary and  content.   ENL teachers are also equipped with iPads to provide on-demand visual supports, audio translations and read-aloud  books, etc. to utilize in the integrated classroom. In addition  P.S.102 has a plethora of technology  based resources  Discovery Education, Pebble Go, My Capstone Library, Epic! Reading A-Z, Trueflix and Bookflix which are  utilized by the classroom and ENL teachers in their classrooms.            In order to expose our ELLs to the types of questions they will be presented with on the NYSESLAT, ELA, and state Math   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72         test, new materials are used in After School and Saturday Academy programs focusing on such skills as response to graphic  information, listening for academic content, language arts, math, social studies, and science themes.               15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    PS 102 does not share a building with any other schools at this time.            16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).            The parents of newly enrolled students in Kindergarten are invited to a Kindergarten orientation in June.  They typically  bring their children to the school building.  At that time, families are given a tour of several kindergarten classrooms so that  students and parents have some familiarity with the classroom and school setting. We have several interpreters  as well as key  staff members present to answer questions.  Additionally, our parent coordinator arranges school tours for families of  prospective students throughout the year. If the student is a potential ELL, the parent coordinator will introduce the family to  the ELL staff and arranges for an interpreter to accompany the family when necessary.           17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    At this time, PS 102 does not offer any language electives to any students.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Due to lack of parent selection for dual language programs, PS 102 does not currently provide this  program.          Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?         Professional Development (PD) at PS 102 takes place on Mondays from 2:40-4:00pm during the time mandated by the  New York City Department of Education. PD is planned by a committee that includes the principal, the upper grade literacy  coach, the UFT representative, four lower grade classroom teachers, and two upper grade classroom teachers.          Topics of PDs vary throughout the year based on school needs and teacher interests, but upcoming topics for the 2018- 2019 school year to will include, but not limited to: the Danielson Competencies, homework policies, pacing calendars for  literacy and math, procedures for administering math performance tasks, subgrouping for ELA and Math instruction, and how  to present STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) lessons. Other topics will include backward planning,  Smartboard training, using free online educational resources, collaborative unit planning, special meetings for first year  teachers, guided reading, taking running records, and conferencing. Yet other PD topics will include designing and using  student-friendly rubrics, using the DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit to assist with parent meetings, NYSESLAT skills and  data, and writing quality IEPs.         The Professional Development Committee of PS 102 meets monthly to map out the Professional Development Workshops  for the following month. As part of the monthly mapping for Professional Workshops on Mondays from 2:40-4:00pm, 15% of  the total hours will be implemented as per the Subparts 154-1 & 154-2 adopted regulation for ELL-specific PD for all teachers  throughout the 2018-2019 school year. The ENL department will provide a list of workshop topics and then confer with The   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73         Professional Development Committee as to which workshops will best support the needs of the pedagogues. The following  topics have been listed by the ENL Department for the upcoming school year, but are not limited to: Part 154-2 English as a  New Language Units of Study and Progression Levels, Language Acquisition, Best Practices for Co-Teaching, Strategies and  Integrating Language Instruction for English Language Learners, Distinguishing Language Acquisition from Learning Disabilities,  Performance Level Descriptions for Listening/Speaking/Reading/Writing, implementing the NLA Bilingual progressions to  support ELLs in the classroom and the EDAT tool for data purposes.  Additionally, ongoing workshops attended at Brooklyn  South Support will be turn-keyed to support the schools pedagogues best practices for teaching ELLs during Professional  Development in order to meet the needs of our diverse population of ELLs.           In addition as per the new Sub-parts 154-1 & 154-2 ENL teachers will clock in 50% of ENL related Professional  Development for the  2018-2019 school year: Professional Development Workshops on Mondays will include, but will not be  limited to: study groups on researched-based articles, turn key information by ENL pedagogue(s) who attended Professional  Development Workshops through Brooklyn South Support. In addition, ENL pedagogues will also fulfill these ELL-specific PD  requirements by attending: The UFT Professional Development Center, ENL conferences, The Office of ELLs, ENL seminars, in  addition to online ENL professional development courses.          ENL teachers participate in PD organized by the Office of English Language Learners in order to support their work in  engaging ELLs with the CCLS. PD specific to ENL teachers is turn-keyed during the Monday PD sessions mandated by the NYC  DOE as well as during ENL team meetings held during the teachers' professional periods. ENL teachers who attend valuable  workshops through outside organizations or the Office of English Language Learners also present relevant information to  classroom teachers to support their work in assisting ELLs as they learn within the CCLS.            Additionally, long-term PD was provided for ENL, speech, AIS, and special education teachers in the Orton-Gillingham  method. 30 hours of training was provided by an outside consultant. The PD was followed by weekly in-classroom support  provided by the consultant for the teachers who had received the training. Similarly, a year-long in-classroom professional  development program was provided for several Kindergarten teachers in the Reading Reform program to prepare the teachers  for the early literacy needs of their students, including ELLs.           2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.        Professional Development at PS 102  is coordinated to ensure ELL-specific topics including using the DOE Translation and  Interpretation service, ELL specific instructional strategies including using Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP)  techniques in the classroom, the eligibility procedure for ELLs, NYSESLAT testing requirements, and other topics are presented  totaling 15% of the total PD hours for all teachers. ENL teachers receive additional Professional Development provided by the  Office of English Language Learners and relevant topics are then presented to the school community in Monday PD sessions.  Additionally new ENL teachers participate in an extended mentoring program beyond the one year mandated by the NYC DOE  with Ms. Angelakos, one of the senior ENL teachers and a co-coordinator for the ENL department. ELL-specific topics make up  50% of the PD ENL teachers receive throughout the year and attendance records of all PDs as well as agendas are kept on  file.               Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?              During the DOE provided time on Tuesdays for Parent Engagement, ENL teachers organize individual parent meetings to  discuss the goals of the ENL program, progress in language development, assessment results, as well as progress in the content  areas for integrated ENL settings. Translation, when needed, is arranged through the DOE's Translation and Interpretation unit   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74            or with the assistance of a bilingual paraprofessional if available. Meeting notes are recorded and retained by the ENL teacher  in a binder using department-created forms. ENL teachers record the content discussed during the meeting as well as any  agreed upon next steps. Invitations to individual parent meetings are sent home in the native language as well as in English in  the students' message folders.   ENL  and classroom teachers gather data for each of their ELL students. Examples of data gathered include students  breakdown of each language modality on NYSESLAT, reading levels, teacher produced assessments given throughout the  school year, and literacy portfolios. When meeting with parents, the data is analyzed and discussed with parents to determine  the next steps in language development and areas of growth. Teachers prepare materials for parents to take home to ensure  that these language goals and skills are met. ENL and classroom teachers explain to parents how these goals will be met during  content area instruction. ELL differentiation are present in each content area lesson and presented to parents to fully describe  each students goals for the lesson.          2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.                      Our parent coordinator Ms. Margaret Sheri is a valuable member of our school community.  She maintains a list of  second language resources, tutors, and volunteer interpreters and translators. She also maintains the parent information  board and table.  She coordinates the PS 102 Parent Library that includes many bilingual books, organizes parent workshops,  works with the PTA and school staff on monthly school spirit events, and collaborates on special events such as the Ragamuffin  parade, the annual Beach Clean-Up, TV Turnoff Week, Garden Club, Family Sports Nights, Movie Nights, and Ice Skating Nights.  Ms. Sheri is also runs an ENL class for parents from October through May which focuses on developing conversational skills.  Ms. Sheri also coordinates the PS 102 website which offers a great deal of information including an updated calendar, events,  and translated parent guides.           The ENL staff collaborates with the parent coordinator to organize parent workshops that focus on ways parents can  reinforce language acquisition and academic development for our ELLs as well as ensure their active participation in the  classroom. Annually, the ENL staff provides NYSESLAT workshops for the parents of our ELLs to inform them of the test’s  expectations. With the assistance of our parent coordinator, the ENL department provides ENL materials appropriate for adults  to inquiring parents. Our parent coordinator distributes translated information about adult ENL programs and other  community resources. She provides interpreters and translators when needed for parent teacher conferences, PTA meetings,  and other events. Ms. Sheri also provides current lists of adult ENL classes at other locations, family literacy programs, and  other social services to our ELL parents upon referral.               Furthermore, our parent coordinator coordinates the Learning Leaders program which provides tutoring for our students,  including our ELLs, who need further academic support. The Learning Leaders program trains many bilingual parents to work  with our students and has become a great vehicle to actively involve parents in the learning process as well as in our  school.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Cornelia Sichenze, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Bayview                                                                              School DBN: 20K102  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Upon registration, all parents complete an oral interview along with the Home Language Identification Survey  with the assistance of a trained pedagogue to determine the child’s home language. In addition, an informal  screening is conducted with the child. The Home Language Identification Survey includes a supplementary section  that asks parents to indicate their language preferences when receiving important information from the school in  writing or orally. After reviewing this information, written translation and oral interpretation needs can now be  assessed at registration for newly admitted students.    We also review various ATS reports such as the Home Language Aggregation Report and the Place of Birth Report  to monitor shifts in our demographics. In addition, we conduct informal interviews among the school staff,  parents of our ELLs as well as parents who may speak another language to assess the need for translation or   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78      interpretation services. We review records of the number of requests for interpretation and past participation of  non-English speaking parents at school events, parent workshops, and conferences.                2.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.         We will first attempt to have a bilingual professional staff member assist in speaking with LEP families in the event of  an emergency related to one student or family. In the event of a school-wide emergency we would first send an  emergency text and phone bulletin over our school phone system. We would then use bilingual staff to assist in  contacting LEP families.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      The principal and assistance principals stress the importance of communicating with all families at opportunities such  as staff conferences and grade meetings. The instructions on using the T&I translation and over the phone  translations services are provided to all staff at the beginning of the school year, and prior to all four conferences.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The Welcome Poster is displayed at the entrance to the school . The Parents' Bill of Rights is distributed in the  Students' Communication Folders in September in English as well the 9 other available home languages. The Parents'  Guide to Language Access is distributed in English as well as the available home languages at registration and during  ELL Parent Orientation Meetings. Additionally, the Information for Parents brochure is distributed during the Meet the  Staff Parent Conference at the beginning of the year as well as at all Parent-Teacher Conferences. The Language ID  Guide is available at the security desk as well as in the main office.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          84     Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Each year the Parent Coordinator distributes a survey to teachers to indicate number of written translations of each  language are requested for the class. The teacher bases this on the RPCL report and by polling students. A letter also  goes home early in the year asking parents to confirm phone number and correct language for the school message  system. The Parent Coordinator works closely with the families at the school and is always open to feedback and  suggestions regarding improved availability of translation. The school then receives additional feedback from the  School Learning Environment Survey as to the quality and availability of translation services.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          85
