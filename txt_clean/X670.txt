The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   According to our Mission Statement:      At Health Opportunities High School we are dedicated to providing rigorous and stimulating instruction as well as  establishing a nurturing and supportive environment that will enable our students to achieve their graduation  requirements. Our graduates will be prepared for higher education and the world of work. We are committed to  seeing our students achieve academic excellence, global awareness, and leadership skills.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Our standards-driven instruction, internships and study opportunities enable all students to acquire career related  skills, explore issues of self-awareness, interpersonal relationships, and respond to the demands of global citizenry.  We strive to create well-rounded civic-minded individuals who are involved in local as well as global communities,  and who are prepared to succeed long after they have graduated from our school.   Using the data from the Learning Environment Survey and recommendations from student members of School  Leadership Team and Student Council, we made our priority to provide all with the experiences of a large school  within a close knit community that values the needs of each constituent member. At HOP every student is  nurtured, known, safe and challenged.   We believe in strong correlation between academic support and emotional and social development. The school  succeeds at offering the mixture of rigorous curriculum, including 5 Advanced Placement courses, required four  years sequence in Math and Science, three foreign language, for-credit after school and Saturday program, work  certifications program with a support team of four guidance counselors and three social workers. We are one of ten  schools in NYC who has a fully-staffed medical clinic in partnership with Morris Heights Community Health Center  and Day One Teen Rapp program. Public School Athletic League and robust variety of clubs and societies provide of  opportunities for students to pursue different interest.    We start the new partnership with NYU College Corps and expect to continue the results in 95% of our graduating  seniors being accepted to colleges. The graduation requirement for our school is at least 120 hours of community  service. Partnerships with Hostos Community College and Department of Aging Geriatric Care allow students to  graduate with certifications in Home Health Aide, Nursing Assistant, Coding and Billing, Phlebotomist Assistant and  Pharmaceutical technician. We provide robust and diverse array of activities for students: LEAP On Stage, Liberty  Partnership programs, Blue Cross Blue Shield, BUILD and receive the Service in School award every year.    Through belief in three “As”, Academic, Athletics and Arts, we offer courses in every artistic discipline, Chorus,  Drama, Art, Artistic Textiles, Journalism, Film and Media Studies, Dance, Photography and our students participate  in the Talent Shows and exhibit their work.   Starting the fall 2017 the targeted group of tenth graders are involved in AVID, Achievement via Individual  Determination. The program is dedicated to closing achievement gap by preparing students for college and post- secondary opportunities through Writing, Reading, Inquiry, Organization and Collaboration.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   42% of our student population are students with needs, including Students with Disabilities and English Language  Learners.    Students with Disabilities include the equal number of students with learning disabilities and emotional disabilities.    The growing number of English Language Learners are also Students with Interrupted Formal Education. The  growing number of our English Language Learners leave in the middle of the academic year for a significant time to  the countries of their origin and do not attend schools there. This negatively affects the credit accumulation when  students come back and impacts the high chronic absenteeism rate.   24% of our students are in the temporary housing.   We are 91% free or reduced lunch.    The 97% of our students are first in their families to attend college.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our school has made the most progress over the years in the element of “Collaborative Teachers”. After analyzing  data from our “in-house” observations tracker and later from Advance, we realized that we have to provide more  time for professional development for teachers in areas of instruction being customized, inclusive, motivating and  aligned to the Common Core, with high standards set in every classroom, and students achieving at ever higher  levels. Instituting a mastery-based curriculum that focuses on skills explicitly tied to meaningful future career paths  will connect string instruction to a higher level of post-secondary readiness. In order to achieve this, all content  areas teams (ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies, and Special Education) meet on a daily basis at designated time to  plan and collaborate. This academic programming initiative was facilitated in collaboration with School Time Lab  personnel to provide the faculty with an opportunity to work on development of students’ academic behavior, plan  rigorous and challenging instruction, develop assessments, analyze those assessments and implement action plans  to improve instruction based on those assessments.   The school has made a remarkable progress in the area of Supporting Environment. The overall school attendance  increased from 76% to 81% in the 2017-2018 school year. We attribute this increase to the expanded initiative of  Success Mentors and implementation of KINVOLVED parent notification app.   We made the most progress in the element Strong Family and Community Ties, through effective planning and  reciprocal communication with families, parents participate in variety of activities on how to engage their children  in learning and have an opportunity to take classes in the evening on school campus through Adult Learning Center  at Hostos Community College and offered by our own faculty.   The key area of focus for this year will concentrate in the element of Rigorous Instruction and Supportive  Environment as identified through a variety of data tools and after completing a comprehensive needs assessment.                   2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 07X670   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   491   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           47       Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           48      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Health Opportunities High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title  I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students  Health Opportunities High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           49      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           50      ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           51   School-Parent Compact (SPC)      School-Parent Compact (SPC) Template      Health Opportunities High School , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student  Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student  achievement between the school and the families.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?     Health Opportunities High School uses the data from the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, Scantron Preformance Series, NYS Regents,  Interim assessments, as well as  teacher-made formative and summative assessments to determine the literacy skills of our ELL  population.  As a result of the aforementioned assessments, the data collected informs us that students struggle  with  comprehending  tier two and three vocabulary, inferencing and drawing conclusions.  In their writing, they have difficulty  introducing a clear central idea or a precise claim, supporting  claims with sufficient evidence, exhibiting logical organization of       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61         ideas and information to create a cohesive as well as coherent essay.  This tells us that we need to  a) intensify vocabulary instruction across the curriculum as well as require students to use the vocabulary in their writing and  verbal expression  b) do more frequent modeling of and practice with inferencing   c) model strong writing strategies and provide more writing activities for students across the curriculum .      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Across content areas, embedded within the curriculum, unit plans, lesson plans, and assessments are vocabulary, listening,  writing, reading and speaking instructional tasks.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the progress of our ELLs with the use of data  from the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, Scantron, NYS Regents, Interim  assessments, as well as  teacher-made formative and summative assessments.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered and evaluated a focus is established and interventions are put in place, such as,  modifications to the curriculum, unit and lesson plans are made, tutoring and/or Saturday  programs are implemented.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    ENL students do well on the speaking and listening section of the NYSESLAT.  By the time they reach 10th grade, many have  become Transitioning in those modalities.  However,  they are slower to gain proficiency in reading and writing.  In the 9th  grade they range from entering to expanding, while in the 10th and 11th grades they plateau at the expanding level. The  majority of students tested at expanding and those at commanding continue to receive services  for two years. On other  regents (Alg, Global, ELA, US Hist) students have struggled on the writing portions thus there is a focus on writing across  content areas.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Content Area  teachers along with the ENL teacher, analyze the results of the baseline assessments and create a focus, using  the data, that will drive instruction.  Strategies are embedded into the curriculum, unit and lesson plans that meet the needs of  the students.  Interim assessment are used to track progress and the new data is then used to further drive the instruction.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62          All ENL students, Entering,  Emerging, Transitional and Expanding (commanding for an additional 2 years),  follow  homogeneous groupings  by grade but heterogeneous in proficiency levels using  a push in model within the ELA class.  Additional instruction is delivered via an ESL self-contained model for Entering as well as Emerging students and are  heterogeneous in both grade as well as proficiency level.         b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?    ELLs are programed according to their proficiency levels  as well as mandated service requirement and grade level. A student  has approximately eight periods a day on their schedule, each period is approximately 50 minutes with the exception of lunch.  Our school uses an ENL self-contained model for Entering (360min) as well as  Emerging (180 min) students  and ENL students'  programs reflect their mandates in the form of periods in which they receive ENL services. An entering ELL has two periods  (out of eight) of self-contained ENL classes plus an integrated (ELA) class included in their program aside from their other  content area classes, an emerging  ELL has one period of self-contained ENL as well as a push-in reflected on their  schedule,  transitioning as well as expanding receive one period of integrated (push-in ESL) instruction within ELA.  and  commanding/proficient ELL receive 90 minutes of support within the ELA class.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Due to the nature of our program model (self contained ENL) content area instruction is delivered in English with an emphasis  on front loading vocabulary and using visuals to support the language learning process.  All content area classes are in English,  however, teachers employ a variety of strategies (ex. SDI, multiple entry points, tiered vocabulary, front loading, glossaries,  bilingual dictionaries, graphics/visuals, modeling, scaffolding, etc.) to facilitate their English Language acquisition and increase  their ability to meet CCLS.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   All Spanish-speaking new entrants to a NYC school who score at or below the cut scores on the NYSITELL  must be  administered the Spanish LAB only once during the same testing period in order to determine language dominance for  instructional planning and providing services. Students use DOE approved glossaries for assessments and Regents exams are  ordered in students' native languages, if available.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Differentiating instructions to ELL subgroups is important in order to address the diverse academic needs of each individual  student. Students in various ELL subgroups require differentiation in their instructional plans that accommodate their specific  intellectual needs. a. SIFE students require a comprehensive approach that builds on the student’s existing ways of learning  and communicating. Scaffolding strategies such as modeling language, bridging information and expanding prior knowledge,  contextualizing new concepts with a sensory environment, and increasing metacognitive development will assist SIFEs during       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63      their transition into English Language instructions. These scaffolding strategies are temporary and should be dissociated at a  time when they are no longer necessary. The use of cognates from a students’ native language to English also helps increase  vocabulary and language comprehension skills.   ELL students with less than three years in US schools require instructional plans that focus on their limited or restrictive English  Language skills. Strategies such as increasing vocabulary and identifying sight words, effectively reiterating grammatical rules  and principles of the English Language, guided practice, expanding critical reading skills and providing native language support  supplements ENL approaches to those students with limited English proficiency. Pairing newcomers amid students with higher  English Language proficiency levels and students that share their native language helps students learn from one another. This  strategy provides peer mentoring opportunities for both newcomers and higher language proficient students. Encouraging  verbal communication in English, modeling the proper use of language and grammar, and strengthening reading fluency are  also essential for newcomer ENL students.         ELL students receiving service 4 to 6 years frequently require assistance concerning the improvement of their reading and  writing skills. Although these students may encompass adequate basic interpersonal communication skills in English,  these students lack cognitive academic language proficiency which is essential for the achievement of a higher education.  Stressing language fluency, grammatical and writing skills are central to the academic success of these students.  Long-term ELLs, which have completed 6 years of ENL instruction, require instructional plans that focus on strengthening  written communication. Reading comprehension and oral expression are stressed and thoroughly assessed and evaluated.   Former ELLs will continue to receive 90 minutes of ENL services as well as accommodations such as bilingual dictionaries,  glossaries, and time and a half when taking Regents exams.  To curtail the percentage of LTE students and assist in the instruction of SIFEs, students will be given tutoring in an expanded  learning day, giving them an additional hour of academic enrichment after school per week. Coupled with our Saturday  Academy, which gives students an additional three hours of ENL instruction with a certified ENL teacher on Saturday  mornings,  our LTE students and SIFEs receive a total of an additional four and a half hours of academic enrichment and  instruction per week to help improve their English fluency levels.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELL-SWDs use many strategies and data from the Scantron Performance Series, NYSESLAT, and teacher made  formative as well as summative assessments to accelerate English language development and provide multiple entry points to  access academic content areas. ENL teachers continuously communicate with common area and special education teachers to  support the students’ academic progress outside the Freestanding ENL classroom. ENL teachers also reinforce grade-level  material taught by special education and common core teachers with the use of targeted intervention and additional  instruction.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  In order to accommodate the diverse necessities of ELL-SWDs, teachers differentiate instruction, create multiple entry points,  and meet with other teachers to discuss the needs and progress of the ELL population. In addition, the IEP teacher also  provides AIS in literacy to SWD. These differentiations are based on collaborations between the administration, ELA, ENL and  special education teachers, and common core teachers. In addition to differentiation, our school assists our ELL-SWD students  by compiling students’ schedules in a manner that best fits their academic needs. Extra support, targeted intervention, and  after school programs offer additional opportunities for added academic assistance as well as credit accumulation.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention programs such as peer tutoring, and Saturday Academy includes tutoring in English Language Arts,  Mathematics,  Science and Social Studies, aside from credit bearing classes, giving our ENL students additional hours of  academic enrichment. Our ELLs, including but not limited to ELL-SWD, LTE, and SIFEs, potentially can  receive nearly 7 hours       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64      of additional academic enrichment and instruction per week to help improve their English fluency levels and other core  content area challenges.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the upcoming school year, we will continue to grow our Saturday academy, peer tutoring, and continuing the extended  instructional day.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All students, without exclusion, are afforded equal access to all school programs. All of our students, including Special  Education and ELL students are required to perform volunteer work in the community through our health internship  programs.  We currently have over twenty partnerships with community organizations and health care facilities.  We also  encourage our students to take advantage of extra-curricular activities, many of which are sponsored by our community-based  organizations (such as PSAL, Liberty Partnership and East Side House) as well as participate in AP fo All (advanced placement  classes).     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The ENL teacher models what is to be taught and encourages participation from all students through hands-on activities as  well as other tools that ensure positive interactions. The class is equipped with a laptop cart, video camera, audio books, a  smart board, projector, leveled library, charts, and maps that support the students with disabilities.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   As per data, the most common language other than English in our school is Spanish. Therefore, students receive Free -standing  ESL and  native language support is offered ranging from level one to AP Spanish.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Students receive academic materials that are rigorous as well as age and grade level appropriate. scaffolding is used to build  the students' academic abilities.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our ENL teacher collaborates with CSSJs ENL teacher to share strategies and as a campus we encourage our students to take  advantage of extra-curricular activities including but limited to PSAL as well as clubs and community service activities such as  Lupus walk.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Students who enroll during the school year are partnered by the guidance counselor, social worker, ENL teacher of other  support staff with a student who shares their native language that encourages socialization and community support.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    In addition to Spanish 1 through AP Spanish, we also offer Russian 1 as well as Japanese 1.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65         a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  During our Professional Development days, school personnel will work together to identify vocabulary and develop  instructional strategies geared towards ELL students.  One of our focus groups for this year’s Inquiry Team is entering and  emerging ELL students.  Through collaborative effort, teachers will scaffold activities to build reading comprehension  skills.  Students will learn how tier two and three vocabulary is used in various subject areas.  More importantly, teachers will  establish unified expectations and strategies for their ELL students.  ELL personnel participate in workshops and presentations  (facilitated by the Borough Instructional Lead  and the Bronx Borough Field Support Center) which include working on building  academic language in the content classrooms using strategies by Lillian Wong Fillmore that teach strategies to weave academic  language  into the lessons. The workshops address approaches based on current theories and research as well as provide  insights and practical guidance. These workshops offer many practical activities and classroom examples as well as a wide  range of tips to help teachers integrate language development into content area instruction and assessments. In addition,  Teaching Matters will also be providing professional development during our allotted Monday staff meeting.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All personnel participate in PD, as per Jose P, where attendance is taken which include working on building academic language  in the content classrooms using strategies by  Lillian Wong Fillmore that teach strategies to weave academic language  into the  lessons. The workshops address approaches based on current theory and research as well as provide insights and practical  guidance in the following areas:  a.               Developing an additive approach that builds on students’ existing ways of learning and communicating  b.               Modeling and scaffolding language used by content area materials in language arts, history, science, and math  c.               Designing effective assessments and lessons with language in mind  d.               Strengthening the intertwining strands of language, literacy, and content learning  e.               Deconstructing  paragraphs and sentences using Tier II words to learn Tier III vocabulary  In addition, ENL teachers also attend PD by the Bronx Borough Field Support Center to meet the required total number of ELL- specific PD. All staff receive professional development turn keyed by the ENL teacher and from Teaching Matters Coach.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66            Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents are invited to parent breakfasts, parent evening information seminars, citizenship workshops, meet the teachers, one  on one parent/teacher conferences, Family Summits, Family Meet and Greet and mandated parent outreach. Parents are also  encouraged to call and visit the school and/or talk to a teacher.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  ELL parents are  involved in their children's education at Health Opportunities High School. They participate in school activities,  parents’ association meetings, School Leadership Team Meeting, various workshops, volunteering, attending school  conferences as well as supporting events to enrich their children's learning achievement. The school encourages parents to  share their time, skills and talents.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Julie Mchedlishvili, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Health Opportunities                                                                              School DBN: 670  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Health Opportunities High School determines the primary languages spoken by our school community through a  variety of practices. First the Pupil Personnel Secretary, Parent Coordinator, and Assistant Principal review the  necessary ATS reports including the RHLA which provides us with an exact breakdown of the home languages.  Additionally, during the "new student" orientation, all incoming ninth graders and newly enrolled transfer  students are provided with and required to complete an emergency contact "Blue" card which includes an area  for parents to note their preferred language of communication. Furthermore, before each parental conference  throughout the school year each parent or guardian is required to review and update the existing blue card on file  before proceeding to speak with their child's teachers and guidance counselors.           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70         2.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of a school emergency, we call the Language Access Over-the-Phone Interpretation number for  assistance. Staff members have been provided with a flyer with the 1-800- Language Line number to utilize in case of  a school emergency. Additionally, staff members complete a language survey and whenever possible act as translators  that can be made available on an as needed basis throughout the school year to best serve everyone, especially in an  emergency where an "all hands on deck" is called and staff as well as parent volunteers call the homes of all students.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Our school will use an in-house created survey that will access the feedback from limited-English proficient parents on  the services they have received from our staff said data will be used to improve future translation interpretation  services. Presently, there was no usable data but we are considering revamping our survey.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           73
