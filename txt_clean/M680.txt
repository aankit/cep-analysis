The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       7     comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       8     Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: New this year, instead of self-rating, in Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the   Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that  received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) School Review should use the recommendations from the  review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       9      major findings/recommendations from your most recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and  other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The Heritage School, co-founded by Teachers College, Columbia University (TC) in 1996, is committed to creating a  learning community that fosters the development of respectful citizens and leaders who possess the skills and habits  of mind to be successful in higher education and the world beyond.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    In addition to our rich and rigorous Common Core Aligned Curriculum, we integrate culturally relevant pedagogy  across the curricula.    Our primary goal is to address and meet the social and emotional needs of our student body and to create a safe  environment that supports academic achievement. Heritage’s secondary goal is to create and maintain a college  ready culture that stimulates intellectual curiosity and prepares our students for post-secondary success. Our tertiary  goal is to create authentic learning experiences where students are engaged and immersed in various modalities of  learning. We foster students' sense of personal identity and self-worth, linking that to the history and identity of East  Harlem and New York City as a whole.      To help us to achieve our mission we have revitalized existing partnerships, and cultivated new partnerships. We have  renewed our relationship with our founding partner, Teachers College and with Urban Arts Partnership (UAP).  Teachers College, The Center for the Professional Education of Teachers (CPET), will build teachers’ instructional  capacity in research-based best practices that also are aligned to the Danielson Framework to strengthen their CCLS  instructional planning and delivery as well as use of assessments (formative, summative and interim) as part of a DDI- aligned cycle of inquiry. Teachers College, REACH will support the development of our teacher teams as they coach  teacher leaders in effectively facilitating team meetings that are reflective of instructional talk and are results  oriented. Urban Arts Partnership will allow us to integrate the arts into our daily curricula as well as offer students  custom workshops based on an assessment of their needs and interests. This year, we have continued our partnership  with DataCation which is an important component of our efforts to more effectively use data to drive instruction and  student interventions. We have also continued our partnership with Counseling In Schools which has helped us  improve safety and our students' sense of personal identity and self-worth.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Approximately twenty percent of our students have IEP's and nine percent are English Language Learners. Many of  our identified SWD and ELLs require additional services and Collaborative Team Teaching, counseling and testing  accommodations. We hold the same academic standards for all of our students inclusive of Students with Disabilities,  English Language Learners, and Economically Disadvantaged students.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   We have made significant progress in creating a safe, nurturing, and caring environment. In doing this, we have  established a partnership with Kinvolved - an app to help us improve student attendance by sharing real time  information with families. Additionally, this year we partnered with Outward Bound to help us create a sense of  community among students as they build skills to foster effective relationships. They focused on strengthening  students’ sense of community, confidence, and leadership by engaging them in learning experiences that address  trust and team building. Students had an opportunity to reflect on these experiences and learned how to bring critical  2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       11      skills for individual and team success back to their classrooms where there is an expectation for collaborative  teamwork around various academic projects. These activities helped to establish a college-ready environment of  academic and social behaviors. Additionally, this is the fourth year of our Restorative Practice and Peer Mediation  Programs offered through our advisory program. All students in every grade will also have the opportunity to engage  with our third year College Bound Initiative (CBI) Counselor through our advisory structure.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious  intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support)    Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice  Tenet 3 Statement of Practice  Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the  appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.  3.2   The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of  rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning  Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students.  Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction  (DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and  address student achievement needs.  The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner  within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the  arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities.  Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative  assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student  reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.   3.3   3.4   3.5   SOP(s)   Addressed   n/a   x   n/a   n/a               Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus:  Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the  most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources  should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review,  NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School  Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.     1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and   year.   2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   These needs assessments are based on the IIT, Quality Reviews, and PPO visits from the last three years. Additionally,  we reflected on our current practice and completed a self-assessment.   The strengths of the school include an increase in the CUNY benchmark: 34% in 2016-2017 as compared to 21% in 2015- 2016. The school also made Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) in 2016-2017. Based on the data trends of the past three  years, there is an upward trajectory in our graduation rate, the number of students who were accepted to  college/universities, and the number of students who were matriculated in college within 6 months after graduation.  Based on the most recent learning environment survey, we continue to demonstrate great strength in leadership and  teacher collaboration, which are essential elements to the development of rigorous instruction.      The school leader has a plan to help teachers implement CCLS curricula, with structured and consistent collaborative  meeting times as well as in-house and external coaches and PD opportunities. We need, however, to include targeted  goals that address the needs of all students, which includes ELLS and Special Education students.   Interviews and observation of practices indicated that modified work plans for ELLs and students with disabilities are  included in more generic subgroups. Therefore, more targeted and purposeful groupings need to be implemented   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       15      leading to differentiation in instruction. While we have seen significant improvement in students passing the ELA and  Algebra Regents, students continue to struggle in achieving College Readiness benchmarks in both English Language Arts  and Algebra.    Based on our current needs and areas of improvements identified in our most recent Quality Review, we will continue  to strengthen our curriculum. We will emphasize the connection between units of study and daily lesson plans by  targeting specific skills and essential questions. We will also continue to emphasize the vertical and horizontal  connections of skills as it relates to specific grade levels and content areas. This year we will address the instructional  shifts in both ELA and Math. We need to deepen our emphasis in ELA in Shift 6 -“Academic Vocabulary" as well as  Writing from Sources. In Math, we need to further our practice of implementing Math Shift 2 - Coherence, Shift 3 -  Fluency, and Shift 4 -“Deep Understanding."               Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, through an emphasis on the improvement of teacher pedagogy, designing and implementing a gradual  release model of lesson planning, curricula revision, along with an emphasis on utilizing data to modify instructional  objectives (to include grade level skills and subskills), the college readiness index will increase to 48% from 43% in the  2017-2018 school year.           2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       16     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies your  school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this  Framework for Great Schools element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Lead  Teachers  from all  subjects   Sept. 2018- June 2019   Lead Teachers,  Teachers College  CPET and REACH   By the end of each semester, teacher teams will meet with coaches  and administration three times to develop, evaluate, and modify  inquiry-based structures such as the department SMART goals that  look at multiple types of data (including student work, performance  task results, and Regents exam results) to inform grade and content  target skills, which in turn will inform daily lessons that are crafted  around specific learning objectives with appropriate scaffolds and  instructional resources.   By the end of each semester, teacher teams will have participated in  at least four meetings to discuss and modify units of study and three  meetings to discuss lesson planning. They will use specific protocols,  Tri-State Assessment Rubric and Atlas protocols, to make any  necessary revisions in order to help diverse learners develop  targeted skills.    By the end of each semester, Grade Level Teams (GLTs) will have  met at least three times to examine student work products to  examine growth and target skills around instructional shifts for  groups of diverse learners. The data that is gathered will be used to  modify and refine the curricula in order to provide differentiated  instruction that may intellectually engage all levels of learners.        3b – Parent and Family Engagement   All teachers   Sept. 2018- June 2019   Lead Teachers,  Administration,  Coaches   All teachers   Sept. 2018- June 2019   Lead Teachers,  Administration,  Coaches   All teachers   Sept. 2018- June 2019   Grade Level Teams,  Administration   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       17      How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York  State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible  for implementation and oversight.  Core subject teachers, will distribute approved course sylllabi within the first week of school and redistribute during  curriculum night in September 2018. The syllabus will outline the focus units of study, the CCSS, state assessments  that align to the course (when applicable), and the types of summative assessments students will be expected to  complete. Administration will oversee the development of and distribution of course syllabi. Additionally, contact  information will be provided by teachers within the syllabi in order to promote on-going communication between the  school and families. During curriculum night, parents will also receive the information necessary for them to have  access to Skedula in order to view their children's progress from specific faculty members. Families will also have  access to the school website to learn about upcoming exams, school programs, and learning enrichment  opportunities. The website will be updated each semester to reflect most recent announcements and events.        Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment   Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.  Funded partially by SIG and Title I SWP, we will continue to provide instructional coaching support specifically for our  Math teachers. We have also added a mentor for both first and second year teachers. All teachers will be  programmed to meet three days per week in their content teams and two days a week for professional learning  committees and/or with content area teams. Lastly, incoming 9 th graders will be scheduled for an additional ELA  writing skills class and expanded skills development in Algebra.      Part 4b.

Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement  planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal.  1. By February 2019, we will achieve 2% growth towards our 5% intended growth towards the college readiness  index. Data will be gathered two times to assess students' progress towards the department SMART goals that in turn  support the college readiness index growth. Data will be gathered from midterms that are administered during the  2nd marking period of each semester, final exams that are administered at the end of each semester, and Regents  exams that are administered at the conclusion of term 1. This data will be used to identify the skill gaps that impact  student achievement on state regents exams and contribute the college readiness index.      2. By Febuary 2019, Grade Level Teams (GLTs) will meet at least once a month to examine student work products  from formative assessments, summative assessments, and performance tasks that reflect student progress around  instructional shifts in English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics. The instructional shifts promote student  achievement around the college readiness index. GLTs will gather data from all levels of learners, including students  with disabilities and English Language Learners in order to identify skills gaps that impact student achievement  around the college readiness index.       2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       18      3.

For example, data sources  should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review,  NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School  Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.     1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and   year.   2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?   These needs assessments are based on the IIT, Quality Reviews, and PPO visits from the last three years. Additionally,  we reflected on our current practice and completed a self-assessment.   We use existing structures to provide support for students’ academic achievement, personal growth and development  and implement prevention and intervention initiatives to foster positive student behaviors. Based on the need of our  students, suspension data, behavioral occurrence data, and deans logs, we must continue to support and provide a  system that identifies and addresses the social and emotional needs of our students. In doing this, we will remove  significant barriers that will allow for greater academic and personal growth.   ● The school leader and staff have a systematic approach and practice that allows each student to be recognized and  monitored by a group of adults. Any students in need of additional support for academic or social and emotional  interventions are part of a cohort assigned to a group of adults by the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) which consists of an  administrator, guidance counselors, Counseling in Schools, psychologist, deans, and teachers.   ● With the PupilPath software, the school leader is able to allow teachers, students, and parents to access and view  appropriate aspects of each student’s academic and attendance record. We use this data to create intervention plans.   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       20      ● The use of PupilPath has enabled all staff members to share information and to document the progress of each  student. Parents are also able to access their children’s data online. The guidance counselor makes phone calls to the  home every day to check on students who are absent.    ● The school is practicing anti-bullying initiatives through assemblies. Counseling in Schools works with teachers to help  develop respect and positive rapport in the classrooms.    We need to improve our student outreach and emotional support by utilizing various stake holders including our CIT,  guidance counselors, Counseling in Schools, psychologist, deans and teachers to strengthen and play a significant role in  furthering the achievement of identified students at risk for failure, and to create a responsive and supportive school  environment for all students through interventions and celebrations. This will be the fourth year we continue to expand  our Restorative Practices offered through our Advisory program. Also embedded into our Advisory structure, all  students will receive grade specific college and career support through our College Bound Initiative (CBI) counselor.

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high-need  student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE,  STH).   Key Personnel  Who is responsible  for implementing  and overseeing the  activity/strategy?  (include school,  educational  consultants and/or  CBO staff)   1. We have developed and implemented an advisory support  structure where all students meet within small groups on a weekly  basis to engage in restorative circles. These weekly meetings will  include two faculty members - guidance counselors and teachers.  During this advisory period, students will be provided with  emotional and social support, including positive behavior strategies,  that may address the factors that often contribute to lack of  attendance. Additionally, small group and individual counseling is  available for students using the Restorative Justice Practices. A  checkpoint after the 1st semester will examine progress towards the  goal by examining impact of advisories as measured by decreases in  number of students who are chronically absent.

The Crisis Intervention Team will meet to identify students at risk  and create plans for intervention. Crisis Intervention Team will meet  on weekly basis to create action plans for identified students based  on Counseling In Schools data, teacher referrals, and deans records.  A checkpoint after the 1st semester will examine progress of these  students as per their goals to determine next steps.   3. Analyze impact of students' behavior on overall school culture.  This includes attendance patterns and plans for improving  attendance. The attendance committee will meet on a weekly basis  to identify attendance patterns and trends and will coordinate  parent outreach to continue to involve parents in academic  progress. A checkpoint after the 1st semester will examine all data  gathered from weekly meetings to measure growth and identify  next steps.   4. Encourage student attendance in after-school programs that are  self-selected by students around individual interests and talents. We  will track the attendance to these after-school programs to  determine impact of after-school programs on attendance to school  during the instructional day and use this data to determine next  steps.   5. Guidance Counselors and administration will use the student  tracker developed by New Visions to address student progress as it  relates to credit accumulation, scholarship data, regents progress,  and credits gap analysis as these indicators are impacted by student  attendance.

Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for  implementation and oversight.  During the 2018-2019 school year, guidance counselors, teachers, and deans will communicate with families in order  to inform them of their children's academic progress and attendance, and will meet with families as needed to  support student achievement. During scheduled individual conferences, phone conferences, parent-teacher  conferences, and workshops parents will receive information regarding high school graduation requirements and  credit accumulation that are impacted by chronic absence, college requirements, and various resources such as  Kinvolved and Skedula that may be used to support students' progress at home by tracking completion of  assignments, progress on exams, and how these resources may be used communicate with teachers. Additionally, all  parents will receive information about after-school programs, advisory programs, and academic support resources  that are available to students via the school website and family outreach made by school staff and faculty.        Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment   Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.  We will continue to partner with Counseling In School, Outward Bound, Urban Arts Partnership, Tribeca Film, and  Teachers College. In addition, students will be programmed for one advisory period and one college and career  readiness period per week throughout the school year. Teachers will be programmed to meet in professional learning  committees to plan and develop lessons for the advisory program, including restorative circles.     Part 4b.

Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement  planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal.  By February 2019, there will be two marking periods by which all data will be aggregated to assure that there is  growth towards meeting our goal by reducing the number of students who are identified as chronically absent. While  there will be various quantifiable benchmarks, the leading indicator will be the number of credits earned during the  first semester. This information will be monitored throughout the semester and collected at the conclusion of the  Spring semester.      Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress.  The following systems will be used to collect data:   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       23      1.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 4: Teacher Practices  and Decisions)    Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice  Tenet 4 Statement of Practice  Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the  appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.  4.2  School and teacher leaders ensure that instructional practices and strategies are organized   around annual, unit, and daily lesson plans that address all student goals and needs.   4.3  Teachers provide coherent, and appropriately aligned Common Core Learning Standards   (CCLS)-based instruction that leads to multiple points of access for all students.   4.4  Teachers and students work together to implement a program/plan to create a learning   environment that is responsive to students’ varied experiences and tailored to the strengths  and needs of all students.   SOP(s)   Addressed   n/a   x      n/a            4.5  Teachers inform planning and foster student participation in their own learning process by  using a variety of summative and formative data sources (e.g., screening, interim measures,  and progress monitoring).  Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus:  Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the  most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources  should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review,  NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School  Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.     n/a      1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and   year.   2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   These needs assessments are based on the IIT, Quality Reviews, and PPO visits from the last three years. Additionally,  we reflected on our current practice and completed a self-assessment.   The majority of teachers are engaged in structured inquiry-based professional collaborations on improving student  learning and strengthening teacher instructional capacity. Teacher teams consistently analyze assessment data for  students on whom they focus. Teachers will use the programmed Grade Level Team meetings on a weekly basis to  engage in the inquiry process. The foundation of that will be rooted in the examination of student work to monitor the  alignment of skills across all grades and content areas. Teacher teams will use assessment materials created by all  content areas to monitor for coherence and alignment to CCLS standards.   Teachers regularly analyze student work products and assessment data and do lesson plan study for the purposes of  improving practice.    Teachers ask clarifying questions to get information related to the learning objectives, and guide the presenting teacher  to reflect on clear objectives that would help students achieve the learning goals. The English teachers analyze the   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       25      errors that students make in the mock Regents tests, identify the areas of need, and provided each other with  suggestions for improvements in teaching.    Teachers meet one period a day during the common teacher professional development time and the special education  teachers collaborate with content area teachers on developing lessons, creating Common Core Learning Standards  aligned performance tasks, and evaluating student work.    The math department uses ATLAS Learning’s student work protocol to examine student work samples.    Teachers collaborate on working with the group of ELLs and consistently analyze each ELL’s performance in every  subject class and on the Regents exams. Teachers share the analyses summary for each ELL and the English as a second  language team set up conferences with each ELL to discuss learning goals, set up academic interventions and help them  prepare for the Regents exams.    Teacher leaders have developed whole-staff professional development activities and the school is working towards  building a school-wide instructional coherence that would increase student achievement for all learners.    While the school leader and teachers are allocated time to engage in discussions about the development of lesson and  unit plans and the use of student data, the process needs to be strengthened and aligned with the college readiness  metrics. Although teachers are aware of how to read and analyze student test data, the response to this data in terms of  lesson planning can center more on general curriculum, and does not consistently address students’ learning needs.  Emphasis will be placed on determining purposeful groupings for daily lessons that stem from the findings of data  inquiry, which in turn will inform the specific methods of differentiation to be incorporated.        Part 2 – Annual Goal    Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

The school leader ensures that all staff members are aware of and are practicing the school vision for implementing the  Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) and that they are communicating with students’ families through PupilPath ,  Curriculum Night, and the School Leadership Team. School leaders have put specific structures in place to ensure the  school's vision is implemented:   ● School leader’s distribution of roles and responsibilities encourages all stakeholders to be part of the plan for progress  and in creating a curriculum that guarantees graduation and college readiness for students.   ● All staff is required to be part of an inquiry team meeting for academic support of students.    2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       29      ● With respect to programmatic resources, Mondays have been shortened to provide time for teachers to meet for  Professional Development, Grade Level team Meetings, and Committee Meetings.   ● The school leader has implemented an observation system that the school community members are aware of, and the  staff is practicing how to be reflective and evaluative of their professional practices.    While the school leader has some structures and systems in place to identify and improve critical school needs based on  the SCEP, there are limited evidence-based systems that are used to modify school-wide practices.    ● In terms of student achievement, curriculum, and teacher practices, there are aspects of a structure as staff meet  regularly to work with students in subgroups that require intervention for academic and social and emotional support;  however, those meetings addressed mainly the immediate needs of the students and not ways to adapt learning in the  long term.

This impact  of this work will be monitored on an ongoing basis by members of our guidance team and CBI director of college  admissions.        Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment   Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.  We will continue to provide socio-emotional support through the Advisory Program and College Readiness Program  that are built into the school schedule to ensure students are equipped with the skills, as well as time and self  managements skills they need to be successful in their college endeavors. We will also continue to offer advanced  placement courses, an additional ELA writing course for incoming 9th graders, and additional mathematics courses  that will promote students' mastery of literacy skills and mathematics so they better equipped for the rigor of college  courses. Lastly, we continue to program teachers so they are able to meet with their committees in order to refine  the Advisory and College Readiness Curricula based on the successes and needs of our students.

(b) Identify the patterns/trends in conflicts that arise in the school in order to determine the impact they have on  aggressive behaviors and/or other infractions for the purposes of reducing these conflicts.   (c) Train four circle keepers in each grade level who will co-facilitate circles with their advisory teachers.     Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress.  We will also continue to monitor student progress regarding college applications submission, financial aid applications  submissions, college readiness courses, CUNY benchmark, College Now enrollment, and SAT scores. We will also  monitor the number of college acceptance to two-year vs. four year colleges. Additionally, we will monitor  attendance records from parent workshops.     Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action  plan, if applicable.   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       33      Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans     Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a  welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school.  (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement)    Part 1 – Needs Assessment       Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice  Tenet 6 Statement of Practice  Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the  appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.  6.2  The school leader ensures that regular communication with students and families fosters their   high expectations for student academic achievement.    6.3  The school engages in effective planning and reciprocal communication with family and  community stakeholders so that student strength and needs are identified and used to  augment learning.   6.4  The school community partners with families and community agencies to promote and provide  training across all areas (academic and social and emotional developmental health) to support  student success.   6.5  The school shares data in a way that promotes dialogue among parents, students, and school   community members centered on student learning and success and encourages and empowers  families to understand and use data to advocate for appropriate support services for their  children.   SOP(s)   Addressed   x   n/a   n/a   n/a               Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus:  Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the  most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources  should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review,  NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School  Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.     1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and   year.   2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   These needs assessments are based on the IIT, Quality Reviews, and PPO visits from the last three years. Additionally,  we reflected on our current practice and completed a self-assessment.   The school leader has emphasized high-school graduation and college readiness as a school-wide priority and has  disseminated communications to families about the school’s high expectations for student achievement. The hiring of a  bilingual parent coordinator, as well as the appointment of additional clinicians and guidance counselors to serve the  students provides more staff to ensure adequate communication with parents.   The school leader has successfully instituted an open-door policy; there are workshops and outreach materials and the  guidance counselor make phone calls to remind parents of those resources.   Guidance counselors contact and meet with students who are currently failing, as well as with their parents, to discuss  various steps to move them forward. Additionally, access to PupilPath, along with the guidance of teachers on how to  interpret the information that has been displayed, allows parents to track how well their children are doing in school.  Regular communication between the school and families about the school’s expectations for student achievement  enhances the relationship between families and the school, which contributes to students’ academic success.   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       34      All members of school staff are aware of and are practicing the protocols for communication with parents:   First, several attempts are made through phone calls, then a letter is sent to the family at home, then a home visit is  conducted, and as a last resort contact is made with authorities or the ACS. All staff members maintain a log of calls and  the reasons for the calls. There is also WebConnect, an automated phone system that reports if a student is absent or  late. For parents that do not speak English, the school leader and staff seek the help of a translator provided by the city.  The school also has a few bilingual Spanish-speaking staff members, and materials are produced and phone calls  conducted in English and in Spanish, as needed.    While there are attempts from the school community to share data with parents, the practice is at the beginning stage,  and is not being monitored for its impact. Consequently, not all families are empowered to advocate on behalf of their  children’s needs, which minimizes student achievement. There is a need to provide additional training for teachers on  building strong links with parents and for exploring more ways of providing strategies and mechanisms by which parents  can better support their child’s academic journey.    There are plans for training families on how to support student learning growth in several academic areas as well as in  non-academic areas, such as public health resources.    Although parents are able to access and understand some data points from their children’s PupilPath accounts, this  process is also at the beginning stage. Approximately 40 percent of the parents are logging into the grade book on  PupilPath. The school is aware of the need to share and integrate data into parent conversations. As only half of the  parent population is accessing the grade book, there is inconsistency in how data is being shared.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.   Using 75% as a baseline from the 2017-2018 school year, we will increase our parent engagement by 3% by June 2019 to  be measured by: (1) college readiness workshops; (2) academic achievement celebrations; and (3) parent-teacher  conferences.         2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       35     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies your  school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this  Framework for Great Schools element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

ELT provides enriching  educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship- building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and  extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring  that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200  additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of  instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in  grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced  curriculum that can include ELA, Math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections  on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.     Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s)   Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to be  SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    By June 2019, all students will be able to participate in the Heritage Extended Learning Opportunities program (HELO)  and the Saturday Academy where they will have additional time to complete assignments, explore interests, and are  successful in earning credits toward graduation requirements.        Part 2 – ELT Program Type    Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory?   X   Voluntary      Compulsory   If the ELT program is voluntary, indicate how you will actively encourage the participation of all students, with the  goal of serving at least 50% of students.   The Heritage ELO Committee has been working closely with all partners to plan and implement the extended learning  opportunities program. In its efforts to recruit and retain students, the school has and continues to hold assemblies,  make announcements, distribute letters and post fliers alerting students and parents of our programs. Students are  aware that they may earn physical education and elective credits, partake in field trips in and around NYC and are  provided daily, healthy snacks.    For our Saturday Academy, Grade Level Teams, Teachers, and Guidance Counselors identify target students who need  additional support in core content areas by reviewing transcripts, report cards and scholarship reports. Students and  parents receive notification for students to participate in Saturday Academy via PA meetings and other school events.  Guidance counselors provide outreach to students and parents to strongly advocate the Academy. Attendance is  taken weekly and students receive messages through DataCation pertaining to their schedule and participation.        Part 3 – ELT Program Description    Target Population: The ELT program will be offered to all students in the school, with the goal of serving a minimum  of fifty percent of students.  Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program in a Priority School:     Integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make learning  relevant and engaging.     Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as to   promote higher attendance, reduce risk for retention or drop out, and increase the likelihood of graduation.     Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may   benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting.     Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including   opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art.   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       38        Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the supervision of   a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area.     Engage in outreach activities made to families.   Research has shown that students will participate in programs that are of interest to them and be further engaged if a  program can meet them on their level. Our outside partners are helping us engage students in a way that will improve  their academic and social-emotional development. To address the identified areas and to achieve our goal, we have  undertaken extensive research, revitalized existing partnerships, and cultivated new partnerships. We will continue  our relationships with our founding partner Teachers College, Tribeca Film, and Urban Arts Partnership (UAP). The use  of DataCation, will be an important component in our efforts to more effectively use data to drive instruction and  student interventions. In addition Kinvolved a new parent outreach program will provide valuable information on  student engagement in the classroom.   Our program includes multiple activities and classes for students to participate in after school and on Saturdays. The  programs are designed to expose students to new experiences in a safe and nurturing environment, while building  discipline and fostering social-emotional awareness. Students have the opportunity to participate in arts education  and enrichment programs, as well as receive support in math, ELA, and other core content subjects.   Our program menu will offer a variety of classes and activities that cater to each student’s individual interests and  needs. Currently we offer Peer Tutoring in Math and English, Bridging School Transitions for 9 th & 12 th graders,  Introduction to Art, Illustration / Animation, Theater Performance, Salsa Dance, Photography, Film, DJ Club, and  Drumming. In addition, we have a partnership with College Now, which provides access to college courses for 11 th &  12 th graders to earn college credits while attending high school. Through the Literacy Leaders Program, our students  are taught and trained using a rigorous Common Core aligned literacy curriculum. Our students then turnkey this  information and teach literacy to younger students during a paid internship.   We are also providing college and career readiness courses through College Summit a program that prepares our  students from 9 th through 12 th grades for life after high school. Additionally we offer SAT preparation, assistance in  completing college applications, assistance in completing college essay writing and college visits.      Administration and all staff members will be fully engaged in outreach activities made to families. Teachers and staff  members will have the opportunity to meet with parents to discuss course work, school policies, and the overall  academic performance during our curriculum night, individual and school wide parent conferences. Parents will also  be invited to attend our Winterfest and Springfest showcase events where students have an opportunity to  demonstrate what they have accomplished and mastered in the HELO program.        Part 4 – ELT Program Implementation and Oversight   Part 4a. Who will implement the ELT program? Who will oversee the program?  1.   Indicate the key personnel that will be responsible for implementing and overseeing the ELT program, including  school-based staff and any high-quality community partners that will be involved.  If applicable, describe the scope of involvement of all community partners and how the joint ELT program is  structured.   2.   3.  Explain how you will evaluate the program to assess impact on student achievement.  ● The HELO (Heritage Extended Learning Opportunities) committee will develop and administer a survey to students,  parents and faculty to ascertain what students’ academic and social-emotional needs are and what types of expanded  learning/intervention activities might be needed   ● Using expectations and deliverables, as well as information about best practices, the HELO committee will create a  work map coordinating all the various activities for students.    2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       39      ● Grade teams will utilize and adapt a “high-risk checklist” to identify and refer students for HELO and Saturday  Academy.   ● Through analysis of various types of data, student work. OORS reports, DataCation, Report Cards, etc. our CIT,  Counseling In Schools, Guidance Counselors and individual teachers refer students to HELO and Saturday Academy.   ● A format will be implemented for reporting attendance and student data to administration for feedback.   ● Using a protocol & process we will evaluate the quality & impact of existing partnerships and continue our outreach  to organizations that have resources to expand the inventory and more comprehensively meet the needs of students.   ● Guidance Counselors will review report cards and transcripts to identify students for participation in College Now   ● We will periodically present HELO and Saturday Academy to parents and students (i.e. Back to School/Curriculum  Night, PTA meetings, SLT meetings, student assemblies, etc.).   ● A teacher will be hired to coordinate our HELO program.   ● Administration will identify appropriate subject teachers to work with students during the Saturday Academy     We will use various data sources to evaluate our ELT program. The leading indicator for success will be linked   to our CEP goal regarding credit accumulation of our lowest third in all grades. Scholarship reports will be  examined for students earning at least 10 credits during the academic year and at least 5 credits by the  February benchmark. In addition, we will examine OORS reports to monitor behavioral infractions and  suspensions.     Part 4b. Timeline for implementation and completion, including start and end dates.  ● Students will be able to attend each of the Saturday sessions to develop skills that have been identified by the  Grade Level Team (GLT) work as teachers identify skill gaps throughout all content areas and grades. The Saturday  Academy will begin in October after sufficient time has been given to analyze data to identify targeted students. Our  Saturday Academy will begin in Mid October and continue to June to 25th 2019.   ● The HELO program will begin on October 5th to allow for the completion and aggregation of student and parent  surveys. The program will conclude on June 25th.   ● Both the HELO and the Saturday Academy will run through June.   ● The 1 st session of College Now will begin in September and run into December. The 2 nd session of College Now will  begin in January 2019 and run through May 2019.      Starting in August 2018 through June 2019, all students will have the opportunity to engage with the College  Summit curriculum through our advisory setting. In addition, Peer leaders of the College Summit program will  begin working with their peers during our college week from October 26th to October 30th.        Part 5 – ELT Budget and Resource Alignment   Part 5a. Indicate resources needed including human resources, instructional resources, and schedule adjustments to  implement the ELT program.  We will continue to provide our extended learning opportunities through Urban Arts Partnerships, Tribeca Film,  Princeton Review, and after school tutoring.

At the end of every marking period the HELO coordinator, Administration and Guidance Counselors will   evaluate attendance, report cards and any relevant data to help assess the success of the various programs.  By the end of the first marking period we expect to have 100 students enrolled in the various programs  available including salsa, hip hop dance, DJ club, and canoe building club. The program will be assessed for  the second time at the end of the first semester in January. The benchmark will be 150 students enrolled in  the HELO after school programs. An adjustment will be made to the program based on enrollment in the  various offerings and the process of monitoring will continue for the Spring semester. The first and second  marking periods will serve as midpoint checks for enrollment.   2. At the beginning of the school year before the start of our programs, all liaisons from our partnerships will meet  with administration to set appropriate goals. There will be an assessment of these goals at the end of the Fall  semester so that any changes can be made before the beginning of the Spring semester.      Part 6b. Indicate the instrument of measure that is used to assess progress.  Whole school scholarship reports, the NYS accountability measures, and the NYC DOE quality Snapshot will be used to  assess progress.     Part 6c.

The extended  cabinet members include administration and teacher leaders. These teacher leaders also serve as members of the  professional development committee. The teacher leaders have agreed that the assessment to be used for the 2015- 2016 school year will include the MOSL, Mock Regents exams, performance tasks, and Regents exams. Our teacher  committee, through an SBO vote, has agreed to offer professional development for 50 minutes every week. During  the identified sessions, teachers will use various data reports, such as DataCation, to analyze the results of  assessments. Teachers will use this information to examine trends and patterns of student progress. Once achieved,  teachers will identify skills and micro-skills that will be embedded in lesson plans, unit plans, and curriculum maps. In  addition, through the Department team structure, teachers will identify specific skills that have been identified in  assessments and aligned to the Common Core        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20.

The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The Heritage School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Every Student Succeeds Act is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      The Heritage School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       51      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   We have implemented several elements of the CS strategies specifically using the Kinvolved Application which informs   parents of school news, classroom updates which may include attendance, lateness, exams, quizzes, projects, etc. Our  lead CBO partner for this work is TC REACH. At the core of TC REACH’s community school model is teaching and  learning. REACH’s goal is to align all aspects of our wrap-around services with coherence and intentionality that is  grounded in academic data and classrooms. TC bases our professional development for teachers around trends  identified in instructional learning walks of classrooms and around academic outcome data. In addition, we use  academic data to guide programming for ELO/ELT and work to build connections between the school day and out of  school time to support student achievement. We also recognize that students need supports around their physical  and mental health in order to come to school ready to learn.   Since the partnership between TC REACH and Heritage started, our attendance is on an upward trajectory and our  chronically absent students are on a downward trajectory. Our CS strategy impact can also be measured by our  increase in graduation rate, number of students accepted to college, and the number of students matriculated into  college within 6 months after graduation.        Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    By June 2019, as a result of targeted and universal supports for students’ social emotional development, we will see a  5% reduction in chronic absenteeism rates and a 5% improvement in Regents outcomes school-wide.            Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  We believe achieving our CS goals will provide the attention and services students and families need, in addition to  reducing other barriers, so the students can focus on academic progress. We also believe that parents must be  involved in the educational and development of the students and must be included in all school planning. TC REACH  believes that supporting students with wrap-around services and partners in their educational careers will help them  to reach their academic potential. Our attendance and wellness initiatives will help to minimize barriers to learning  and build healthy habits so that students can come to school regularly and be prepared to learn. Engaging with  families as partners for their students and to regularly celebrate student success will help to build support networks  for students that emphasize the value of education and the importance of motivation in achieving academic goals.       2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       58              Part 2 – Community School Partnerships Core Services Action Plan   Part 2a.

In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   2.   3.   4.   The lead CBO for Heritage is Teachers College REACH, and we will continuously collaborate to ensure that the  Community School program activities meet the NYC DOE requirements for a Community School. Given the limited  funding and school’s priorities, the decision was made by the principal and OCS to use a DOE employee as a part-time  Community School Director. The principal and CSD lead the asset and needs assessment and coordinating activities,  and include the TC REACH Director in this process to develop an action plan and budget.   Heritage customizes its ELO/ELT program to respond to the interests and needs of its students. Heritage arranges for  Regents prep courses, SAT courses, and other academic programs and their grade teams use academic data to  strategize about this programming. They also work with partner agencies around arts programming to ensure  students have an opportunity at enrichment activities. TC REACH helps to support the mental health work by   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       60      collaborating with partners such as Counseling in Schools and Outward Bound to provide universal and targeted  mental health supports. TC REACH also connects the school to Kinvolved, an app used for communicating with  parents. In addition, next year there will be a pilot program from Children’s Village to support mental health needs for  STH.    The school and CSD take the lead in arranging for parent/community meetings and the CS Forum in order to gain  input from families and the community. The school uses information from the school survey as another data point for  input into community resources. The CSD and parent coordinator will maintain a schedule of family events that will  provide a welcoming space for parents.    The principal and CSD are in regular communication around the Attendance Heat Map and Student Sorter data, along  with Kinolved data, to strategize short-term and long-term plan adjustments. The attendance team meets weekly to  review data trends and provide updates around case management for individual students. The principal and CSD  communicate regularly with partner organizations around student needs.         Part 4 – Community School Partnerships Oversight   Part 4a. Key Staff and Partners  1.

Name the members of your Community School Team and how meetings will be organized and structured to   engage all stakeholders and be focused on results.   3.  Explain data strategies including the use of the data sorter, and steps that the school will take to ensure that the   appropriate interventions are provided to the right students   The part-time Community School Director, Ada, is an employee of Heritage and she is responsible for implementing  and monitoring the community school initiatives. Counseling in Schools provides staff to support the advisory  program, and Children’s Village will be providing additional counselors to support STH next year. The REACH key  personnel include: Catherine Hogg, who is the REACH Director, and who coordinates with the principal to ensure  programming under the CSGI budget is responsive to student needs. The REACH staff also include an Instructional  Specialist, Danielle Proscia who oversees the design and delivery of teacher PD for REACH, and Kyle Hagenburger, the  ELO Specialist, who consults with schools around ELO programming and helps to manage push-in, after school, and  summer programming at REACH schools. In the past, REACH has also provided graduate students to help with ELO  programing. REACH key partners who support the community school work at Heritage include: Counseling in Schools  and Outward Bound for mental health and social emotional ELO opportunities, and Kinvolved for parent engagement.  School-based staff also provide support for the CS work including: teachers who help to coordinate activities, the  guidance counselors and attendance team who support mental and physical health, assistant principals who help to  coordinate academic supports, and the parent coordinator who supports family engagement.   The Community School Team overlaps with our SLT. Meetings are arranged monthly and are structured around all of  the school’s efforts to improve educational outcomes for students.    Heritage leadership will continuously collect, analyze, and reflect on data to evaluate the program and assess the  impact of activities on student achievement in order to make appropriate and timely adjustments. The principal  monitors the student sorter and attendance heat map data to identify target students for interventions and  coordinates resources across all stakeholders.     Part 4b.

The content area teachers will work with the ESL  teacher to help the 9-12 grade ESL students gain the skills needed to improve in their classes and  pass the regent exams. The classes will be taught after school  from 4:00 to 5:00 pm, from  December 16th to June 9th ,  (Math: Tuesday and Thursdays and, Global Studies: Wednesdays  and Friday). The Math teacher will be teaching reading comprehension, Math vocabulary and the  use of graphic calculator to increase the understanding of solving some regent  problems. The  Global Studies will be working on composition skills, vocabulary development, reading  comprehension and organizational skills and; the ESL teacher will be supporting the content  teachers by  translating in Spanish, clarifying vocabulary and scaffolding the activities  they will  be teaching. The materials that will be used include textbooks, documents, handouts and the  Internet.  Through this after school program, our ESL students who have struggled to succeed in  the classroom, will not only improve content skill and gain confidence but will also make growth  in language levels to become leaders in our school.      The students will be taken to two Broadway shows (The Lion King and Jersey Boys). Bringing  these musicals to the classroom will provide wonderful opportunities to expand vocabulary and  gain familiarity with colloquial expressions and certain grammatical structures. Exploring these  shows can also create an awareness of American speech patterns and nonverbal expression.  Furthermore,  the students will benefit from exposure to the variety of social/cultural issues that  are addressed in the musicals.  Lion King has the music of Elton John. In our unit of biographies,  we will be studying the life of this singer and his music. Using songs of a well known musical  play like Lion King can be a stimulating alternative for ESL classes at any level of  proficiency.  The Jersey Boys show is the book written by Marshall Brickman and Rick Ellice.  The students will be  reading  and analyzing  parts of this book in the classroom. These two  shows are a great supplement to the ESL class, and they are a source of exceptional energy and  excitement that will contribute to the students' success.

Our  professional development program is focused on serving all students and preparing them with  skills and habits to be successful in higher education and beyond. In order to meet the needs of  our English Language learners our ENL  teacher, ELA, math and Social studies teachers will be  attending  seminars and institutes organized by the Department of English Language Learners of  the New York Department of Education. These sessions will provide the teachers opportunities  to better understand student learning, curriculum, materials, instruction, and subject-matter  content. They will expand our teachers' pedagogical tool kits so that are better able to meet  challenges and educate our ENL children to their fullest potential.     The teachers will be attending the following PD sessions, in addition to other PD sessions  scheduled by the office of ENL's.  - Translating research to Practice: Beyond foundational skills.    - Connecting Content and Academic Language for English Language Learners – An Integrated  Approach    - Annual Citywide LOTE (Language Other than English) Conference     - Writing Language Objectives for English Language Learners (ENLs) in the Mathematics and  English  Writing Classroom                                       Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

English language (ELLs) benefit just as much  as from their parents'  involvement in their education as other students. Historically, we have experienced many parents  that do not speak English and find it very difficult to support their kids at school. To reach out to  these parents and increase  the likelihood of their participation, we are going to offer English as a  Second Language classes to them. We will send  a letter to the parents offering this class. We  will be also calling them to attend classes. Ms Rojas will be offering translation  services  (English -Spanish) to answer any concern the parents have.     The class will be an ESL beginning level where parents will be able to learn basic  English  structures to start communicating in the target language. The topics to study are introductions,  greetings, actions, questions, ownership, routine, likes and dislikes and modal auxiliaries to  express necessity, ability, advice, and obligation. The class will  be taught every Tuesday from  8:30  to 9: 15 am by Addis Rojas Marin, the ESL teacher of the school. The classes  will run  from January 14 to June 9 , 2019.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?   The tool our  school uses to assess the early literacy skills of ELLs is the completion of a writing sample, and a reading  comprehension assessment. The QAR  (reading assessment) identifies the specific reading level of each  student. The results of  the periodic assessment are used  to provide one-on-one tutoring, supplemetal resources and to drive instruction. All tests are  taken in English.  Additionally, teacher created formative assessments are created to measure progress towards units goals  and to modify instruction.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teachers meet to share and discuss curricula goals to ensure that ELLs are supported in all subject areas.  Additionally,  teachers meet to review data gathered from assessments to determine next steps that will be used to inform instruction.     2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       69      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   We evaluate the success of our program for ELLs through several factors.  These include: their progress and growth in credit  accumulation throughout the years in comparison to the total school population; their progress in NYSESLAT scores and  eventual scoring out of ELL status; and their Regents scores and proportions of ELL students attaining a Regents diploma.  80 %  of the  students of last year moved one level up through NYSELAT testing.                4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   We are a High School.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    After analyzing the data of  the NYSESLAT, the majority of the students, 14 of 15, are beyond the Entering level, and 11 are  specifically at the Expanding level of scoring of the NYSESLAT.  It was revealed that the students are in great need of reading  and writing support. The  Beginner (Entering) and the low Intermediate (Emerging)  need to improve the speaking and listening  skills.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.         . The organizational model is freestanding - Self Contained.        . The program model is a partial-block schedule model in the ninth, the tenth, eleventh and twelfth grades, the  students are programmed according to course requirements.   The students in freestanding ENL program come from different language backgrounds and English may be the only  common language among the students. As per CR 154 part 154, there are two types of ENL instruction in our school,  The stand alone ENL and the integrated ENL instruction. The Stand alone will develop English language skills so that  the students can succeed in core content courses. The integrated ENL is to build English language skills through  content area instruction. Our former ELLs are receiving this kind of instructions since they only have two periods of  ESL class a week.          b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      c.  DL program.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?               The number of ELL students is relatively small (15 students ranging from Grade 9 through Grade 12).  We believe that  the freestanding model is fundamental in providing support for the ELL population at our school. This allows for better  modified instruction within regular education classrooms as well as better support for these students. ELL students in the  intermediate and advanced levels receive the mandated number of instructional minutes through a self-contained ESL class, in  addition to their ELA instruction. We have organized the five ESL levels ( Entering, Emerging, Transitional, Expanding and  Commanding) ) in the schedule that let the students take the mandated minutes of instruction.  Each block is 47 minutes of  instructions. The Entering  take 360  minutes a week, the Emerging 360, a the transitional students 180 minutes, the Expanding  180 minutes and the Commanding .5 unit of study . In addition to this, the students take 125 minutes of ELA weekly. Students  are grouped in learning stations designed to improve the different language skills, according to their needs.  Spanish is offered  to Spanish speaking students as a native language support.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      The content of the ESL classes supports what the students are studying in the subject clases. Language functions and  structures are learned in context.  The instructional components are based on the New York State ESL standards 1-5. Each class  has a language and a content objective.  Our school's ESL program uses a variety of ESL strategies including scaffolds to  support ELLs subject areas. Some examples of these scaffolds are: modeling, bridging, contextualizing, schema building, text  re-presentation, and meta-cognition.  Graphic organizers and other differentiated learning strategies are used by certified  teachers in content classes. Students are provided with native language dictionaries and books to assist them in their content- area classes. Technology is used for all Heritage students.To  teach reading, the ESL teacher uses strategies  such as modeled  reading,skimming, scanning, re-reading for detail, summarizing, read aloud. Instructional materials for ELL students include ESL  grammar books ( grammar in context), modified novels, modified readers ( EDGE series), multicultural readers, picture  dictionaries, word-word dictionaries, weekly ELL newspapers (News for you), leveled readers, bilingual Regents glossaries, and  NYSESLAT prep books.  Readings are based on real life stories of different topics that  activate students’ prior knowledge.  Teachers utilize relia, pictures, cards, movies, music  to reinforce content and vocabulary.   Regents exams, and state tests like  the NYSESLAT drive instruction. Students also write essays to be prepare for regents. Classes are planned taking into account  the QTEL stratetes and the SIOP model of teaching languages.  ESL instruction is designed considering that each student is  unique and richely heterogeous.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      The ELL's are interviewed by the ESL teacher. We offer regent exams in languages that our students are proficient. Also the  teachers are letting the students, when necessary, to use their native language to explain or respond an evaluation. Teachers  are translating students work from their native language to English to make sure the students are understanding the content  of the class.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     a)     As we have SIFE students,  we would increase our emphasis on literacy and we would carefully ensure that their prior  knowledge and experiences were integrated into the curriculum. Guidance counselors  will also  ensure support these  students.    2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       71      b)     ELLs who are newcomers receive support through the ESL teacher who introduces the ELLs to the school  community.  They are paired with their higher-performing ELL peers and also receive native language support.  All ELLs are  prepared for the Regents through extensive tutoring.  c)     ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years receive self-contained ESL as determined by the needs disaggregated by  listening/speaking, reading/writing, and in addition, receive ELA tutoring.  A focused effort is being made by the ESL teacher to  ensure they prepare well for the NYSESLAT and other high stakes exams.  d)     Our long-term ELLs are the majority of our students and they present several challenges. We meet their needs by  supporting their literacy skills by differentiating instruction based on their learning stregnths and needs. They work in learning  stations to improve reading fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.  They also receive native-language support.  e)         Former  ELLs will continue receiving support by the ESL teacher for 2 more years. Also during lunch time there will be  tutoring available by the ESL teacher three times a week. They can also attend the 9th period class for extra support         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   SWD who have IEPs are assigned to Collaborative Team Teaching and /or SETTS classes. These students will  be evaluated  about  what services they require, and every teacher will take into consideration their existing IEP.  The ESL teacher  will attend  Special Education PDs. Our School  ESL program uses a variety of ESL materials specially the EDGE program that is organized in  levels and assigned to students based on their abilities. Also, various readings and grammar exercises are assigned according to  the student's level. Besides this,  students are provided with extended time for tests and receive glossaries to help them in  their classes.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?         We accomodate our ELL-SWD students in 47 minute  class in ESL and other classes. Students are placed in classes that  provide the support of two teachers, a certified Special Education Teacher and a content-area Teacher. The two teachers are  provided time weekly to plan together to insure that instruction is differentiated and scaffolded to meet the needs of all  students in their classes.  Also,  ELL-SWD have opportunities to practice and work with their peers in classrooms that are non- restrictive, to support their English language growth. Students also have the chance to meet with their teachers during  extended time to receive additional support if needed.                 8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.      In terms of targeted intervention programs, the extended-day program is offered for ELL students to review and strengthen  their skills in their content areas with the support of the ESL teacher.  The math and ELA departments offers a tutoring  program, where many ELL students may receive tutoring in these subjects.   Students who are ELLs have access to the  following technology: smart boards, Edge online, laptops, and cameras.   Students also receive bilingual dictionaries from  classroom libraries in their native language. Native language support is offered as well by the ESL teacher during a native- language reading time.          9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       We will be extending the implementation of the Edge Language program, increasing the exposure of ELL students to Spanish,  strengthening the data analysis of students’ language skills to inform the differentiation of teaching, and augmenting the  professional-development opportunities of our ESL teacher.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   none     2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       72      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELL students are offered equal access to all school programs. ELL students participate in all academic experiences, school wide  assemblies, activities sponsored by the Student Council, and field trips.  They are regularly advised by their ESL and other  teachers as to opportunities for extended-day help, peer tutoring in math, credit-recovery opportunities, and after-school  activities.  In fact, our official Community Choices this year (Urban Dance, Latin Dance, and sports) have an over-representation  of ELL students.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   The following instructional materials are used to support ELLs  a)Students participate in a technology-based program called Edge which enables students to improve their literacy skills,  practice pronunciation and increase fluency.  b)Teachers use themed units which include various types of fiction and nonfiction texts, such as short stories, folktales,  memoirs and articles.    c)Teachers emphasize the Writing Process with all ELL students.  d)Students read high-interest, low-difficulty literature during independent reading.   e) Students read history, culture  and science in  their native language  f) Bilingual dictionaries are used to clarify meaning       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?    Students use native language dictionaries to understand content.  They also have the support of subject glossaries in Spanish,  French, etc. The students ask for clarification of explanations in Spanish to the ESL teacher.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.     The services and resources offered to our ELL students correspond to students’ ages and grade levels, as well as ESL level.  In  some cases, resources are allocated as dictated by the programming needs of a small school.  In others cases classes and  resources are dependent on the needs of students based on age and grade level.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     The following instructional materials are used to support ELLs  a)Students participate in a technology-based program called Edge which enables students to improve their literacy skills,  practice pronunciation and increase fluency.  b)Teachers use themed units which include various types of fiction and nonfiction texts, such as short stories, folktales,  memoirs and articles.    c)Teachers emphasize the Writing Process with all ELL students.  d)Students read high-interest, low-difficulty literature during independent reading.   e) Students read history, culture, and science in  their native language  f) Bilingual dictionaries are used to clarify meaning       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   The school offers school tours to newly enrolled students where they will have the chance to ask questions about the school.  The counselors will assisting the new student through the year to help them adapt to their new environment.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    The  school offers Spanish class as an elective.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       73         a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Paste response to question here:        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   All teachers ( subject area, special education, and ESL)  working with ELLs have received professional development in  differentiated instruction.   Within the school, professional development concentrates on:  •  The literacy needs of the ESL students.  •  Sessions on sharing of online resources that can make instruction more effective.  •  Differentiation of instruction as a general rule but more especially with ELLs.     Also professional development is delivered by Office of ELLs and Teachers College.  The Assistant Principal and guiding  counselors will be and has received professional development in supporting ELLs.     Some of the PD, our teachers will attend will be:  - Language and the brain. How we learn best. Nov 6 and 7  _ Spanish Language Professional Development. Opportunity content based teaching. Nove- 6-7  -Leadership Institute in upper Elementary mathematics for teacher of English Language learners.  Nov 9 - Dec 5 - Jan11        Our professional development program is aligned to Heritage’s vision of serving all students and preparing them with skills and  habits to be successful in higher education and beyond.   In order to meet the needs of our English Language Learners and other students our teachers meet to participate in an inquiry  cycle of looking at student work, analyzing test and exams, and adjusting instruction through various strategies to meet the  needs of all learners.  We are working with Teachers College, Columbia University to provide all teachers with a robust professional development  program to achieve our vision. Outlined below are the three key features of that work:  •     Teacher-leaders one from each grade attends monthly professional development with Teachers College, Columbia  University. These professional development sessions include reviewing Regents and setting benchmarks, using data–inquiry  cycle, questioning techniques – formative assessments techniques, using evidence for reasoning, and building classroom  discussions.  •     Center for the Professional Education of Teachers will guide teachers through a series of thirteen professional  development sessions to develop CCLS lesson plans and performance tasks that reflect the Universal Design for Learning  approach with particular attention on differentiating questioning and discussion techniques to engage all learners.  •     Use of graduate students under the supervision of Dr. Susan Masullo, a literacy specialist at Teachers College, who push  into the ESL classrooms and ELA classrooms of English Language Learners who recently passed the NYSELAT exam for at least  ten hours per week and who participate in monthly data dialogues with the teachers and Assistant Principal Of instruction to  track student progress and identify instructional responses.             2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       74         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   3.    As ELL students transition from middle to high school, staff work weekly in small grade-level teams (GLTs) with several  purposes, among them doing “kid talk” about specific students’ transitions to high school. Strategies are shared and  interventions with parents and administration planned based on data of student progress, for many vulnerable students,  including ELL students.  A member of the Administration is typically present at the GLT meetings, notes are shared with staff,  and support provided to teachers in the form of training for the GLT facilitators.        Professional Development for all teachers will occur during monthly meetings to inform them about ESL related topics, such as  the  LABR, NYSESLAT, testing accomodations, teaching strategies and so forth. All teachers are sent to  PDs offered by the  Network. In addition our staff will be constantly notified of new ELLs and be provided with any necessary trainings and  assistance to better serve the ELL population in our school.  A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of required professional  development hours for all teachers by CR part 80 must be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best  practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction.             Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In addition to the mandated parent orientation and the parent- teacher conferences, the ESL teacher and the different subject  teachers will be orginizing individual meeting with the ELLs parents to discuss the language development progress of the  student as well as the the progress in the different subject areas. The ESL teacher will be translating in Spanish since most of  the ELLs parents speak this language.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Our current parent involvement is  very low,  but we are trying to increase this and provide more opportunities for parents to  visit the school and be involve in it.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dyanand Sugrim, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       77                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Heritage School                                                                              School DBN: 680  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
