This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission Statement   Section 4: CEP Overview      P.S. 215 is located at 415 Avenue S in the Gravesend neighborhood of Brooklyn New York. We are committed to  working collaboratively with our students, teachers, parents and the community to develop the potential of each  child. In our learning environment, our goal is for all students progress at high levels in accordance with state  standards. The school community includes a wide range of cultural heritages including Italian, Chinese, Russian, Latin  American heritage and immigrant communities as well as first generation immigrants from Latin and Central America,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      South East Asia, Georgia, Poland, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and more. Our students make up a diverse  learning environment which focused not only the academic excellence, but also on the arts and social awareness. We  are dedicated to maximizing the individual potential of lifelong learners to become contributing members of our  global society.   “AS WE ENTER TO LEARN, WE GO FORTH TO SERVICE OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR WORLD”      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.S. 215 is a school where the students feel welcomed wanted and where their accomplishments are celebrated and  their ambitions are shared. The staff works to develop the enormous potential, uniqueness and diversity of each child.  We are committed to working collaboratively with all members of our learning community. We believe that to  become successful in educating our students to the highest standards, the assumption must be made by teachers,  administrators, parents and the students themselves, that the students CAN DO IT. This is accomplished by exposing  our students to a diverse learning environment. P.S. 215 is dedicated to maximizing the individual potential of lifelong  learners to become contributing members of our society.    PS215 focuses on the individual learning progress of our students through a varied means of programs and  assessments designed to promote the personal growth and academic development. Our highly esteemed Sigma  Gifted program continues to provide the rigorous academic challenges for some of the best and brightest students in  Brooklyn. That exceptionally high level of academic standard is a hallmark for PS215 and we continue our tradition of  academic excellence. We continue to integrate technology to further support students in their current goals and  prepare them for the next steps in their academic careers. Using technology, our learners are encouraged to plan  towards their futures by our College and Career readiness programs designed to introduce them to the world ahead.  We also continue to build our communication with parents, school leaders, and community representatives  throughout our school community by utilizing our growing digital presence.       PARENTS AS PARTNERS   In order for our students to achieve their goals, parents must be included as partners in their child’s education. Parent  involvement is the key to the educational development of children. We try to involve our parents in many ways  including:     We hold a multicultural festival in the evening for parents and students.    We encourage parents along with their children to attend our family enrichment evenings. Three evening a   week are set aside for various activities (e.g. cooking, yoga, dance, art, literature)     We have a special Saturday morning program for the parents of our ELL population. These workshops offer a   safe haven, where parents can gather to communicate ideas and address individual needs and concerns.  Parents will be provided with effective communicating strategies, a variety of “quality time” activities that can  be easily incorporated into their daily routines, as well as, ways to get additional support within the  community.     PTA meetings are held monthly. The Administration shares information pertaining to new programs being   implemented. The members are integral part of our school community working cooperatively to bridge the  relationships between the school and parents.   SPECIAL PROGRAMS    To foster the high expectation P.S. 215 has, we provide our students with a full range of programs in the arts and  academia. We have a comprehensive arts curriculum that provides sequential standards based arts education to all  students in grades Pre- K- 5.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      We are proud to say that we have students involved in many musical activities from grade and class performances to  our long-standing music program. Our instrumental program begins with our 3rd graders learning how to play the  recorder, extends into chorus and continues with our 4th and 5th grade band.    We believe that health and physical education enhance and benefit the mind and the body. Students are given a  varied and constructive gym program. The parents and students get a report generated from the Fitness Gram.   Our 4th and 5th grade students reach out to our community. Their fund raising efforts have resulted in contributions to  such to charities as Susan G Komen, The ASPA, St Jude and the American Heart Association. . They also collected Toys  for Tots, Leukemia Charity and conducted food drives. This was all done through the Kiwanis Club’s “K-KIDS”.   Council for Unity promotes an atmosphere of integrated cultural values and acceptance of all people within the  school environment. Students learn and practice how to support and communicate tolerance and peaceful conflict  resolution.      EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITES   We are very proud of our after school academic and enrichment programs. We have reached out to our entire  student body and have given them the opportunity to participate in a program that meets their individual needs.  Many of these programs evolved from reviewing and analyzing our data. Below is a list of the many programs P.S. 215  offers:     ELA and Math - Intervention and enrichment programs.    ELL - After reviewing the data from NYSESLAT, we found that our ELL population needed small group   instruction. To support them, we offer academic classes afterschool and Arts+ELA Saturdays.     Upper grades plan and perform in productions varying from stage to Ballroom dancing, providing an   opportunity for multilevel learners to contribute to the school community.     Physical Education - We have a basketball team and cheerleading squad. We have an evening event, called   Staff /Student Basketball Game. 5th grade students compete against staff. Parents and staff attend and  witness the good sportsmanship and teamwork that the students display.     We are thrilled that New York Junior Tennis League’s grant continues this year. Students from all grades get to   participate in the program five days a week.      Building Teams   The Cabinet meets to implement observe and reflect. We are diligently, as a school community, setting SMART goals  in all subject areas that are measurable and obtainable. Expectations of great success prevail throughout the school  and in the students’ homes. Students help to assess their own performance and help to set their own individual  personal and academic goal. This gives them a clear idea of how well they are doing and what they need to do next.  Parents receive a copy of the goals and will receive a copy of the outcomes.   Pupil Personnel Team and School Implementation Team meet once a month to review Individual Education Plans  (IEP) to ensure the quality of the IEP, services and recommendations as well as to make certain that the child has been  placed in the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE).   School Leadership Team meets once a month to collaborate on the ongoing needs of the school. Parents and staff are  equally represented.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Vertical Teacher Teams meets monthly to discuss pedagogical practices.

Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   PS215 supports all learners by providing challenges and support for all students at their individual level.    To support our Special Education students, specifically designed instruction is used to bridge the gap between grade  level and functioning according to each students' individual needs. PS 215 is well aware of the need for a multi-focal  support team for students in ICT, self-contained classrooms, as well as, for those receiving support services which  make up 14% of our population. Pedagogues are DOE trained in Orton Gillingham, and SPIRE to create opportunities  for positive academic outcomes. iReady is used to for targeted assessment to drive instruction. socio-emotional  supports include the availability of at risk counseling and multiple levels of integration throughout the general  education activities and school community. Flexible Programming is used to create opportunities for Special  Education students to participate in student-driven community service organizations such as Council for Unity and K  Kids. During cluster-based activities such as Art, Gym, Science and Technology, Special Education students are  integrated with General Education students to build connections and support appropriate socioemotional  development with their peer group.   At 21% of our population, our Gifted and Talented students participate in academic challenges specifically designed to  challenge and support their academic and socioemotional development. PS215 continues to use the William and  Mary Gifted and Talented curriculum and we are implementing more project-based learning, and Socratic seminars.  To inspire digging deeper into Math, we are developing hands-on math projects focused on solving real world  problems. For 2018/2019, PS215 will continue to provide structured learning experiences around College and Career  readiness with College Exploration projects and Introduction to Financial Planning in addition to extending positive  use social media in an academic forum for our gifted students.    PS 215 services a growing population of students for whom English is a new language. Students come with various  levels of formalized education and therefore they come with varied needs, including language acquisition, social- emotional supports for students and families and acclimation services. PS215 continues to develop and redefine the  resources available to the students that are currently 33% of our population. Working closely with local CBOs, the  local library and our PTA, our school community welcomes Immigrant and ESL families to all events and activities.  Students are supported their English language development by curriculum created and differentiated by their ENL  teachers working closely with classroom teachers. This year, PS215 has selected a new curriculum specifically for ENL  students' second language acquisition. We are also expanding native language and culturally aligned ELA materials in  further support of our newest school members.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   P.S. 215 saw gains through the increased intensity of Rigorous Instruction. Our ELA progress was supported through  the increased use of targeted assessments to drive instruction through the iReady program. State ELA and Math  Assessments show the continued need to target our growing ENL population. Supports for the subgroup of ENL and  Special Education crossover students also requires reassessment. Both current and former ELLs need support to reach  their grade level expectations, which we will provide through intensive refocusing of pedagogy and additional  academic programs for those students.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 21K215   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   920   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  The administration conducts an outreach using the New Teacher Finder as a resource to recruit new teachers to the  DOE without prior experience; perspective teachers participate in a rigorous interview with a hiring team and are  provided opportunities to demonstrate their pedagogical practices. Careful consideration is given to those individuals  who possess dual licenses, i.e. Common Branch and English as a New Language (ESL) or General Education and Special  Education. 100% of our teachers delivering core subjects are highly qualified. Moreover, all of our ENL and Special  Education staff are certified in their respected areas and are deemed highly qualified. More than 90% of the teachers  have been retained at PS 215 for more than 5 years. To continue to retain our HQT, teacher leadership opportunities  will be offered to interested teachers as well as opportunities to lead afterschool activites and clubs for additional  income. School-wide Team-building activities celebrating teacher dedication will be held to further value and build  school community ties.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   PS 215’s administration conducts a needs assessment at the beginning of the school year. The results are used to  determine what professional development activities are warranted throughout the school year. 100% of our teachers  participate in high quality professional development delivered by our school staff as well as outside providers.  Paraprofessionals participate in professional development with the teachers as well as are afforded opportunities to  participate in professional development that is specifically designed for them. Topics for professional development  include but are not limited to: Danielson’s Framework, Instructional Shifts, The Framework for Great Schools, and The  Common Core State Standards.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  The preschool curriculum is aligned to the common core curriculum which is used throughout grades K-5. Professional  development opportunities are provided for all Pre-K teachers in conjunction with the rest of the school staff. Pre-K  teachers are also afforded opportunities to participate in early childhood professional development, i.e. Work  Sampling. Preschool students and teachers participate in all early childhood parent involvement activities. All Pre-K  teachers are evaluated formally and informally by the administrative staff. Pre-K teachers meet with grade K teachers  to discuss re-organization for the upcoming year. At this time records are exchanged and teachers discuss the best  possible placement for each transitioning student. Students who have been classified as a preschooler with a disability  are re-evaluated by the Schools Assessment Team or by the Committee on special education prior to their 5th  birthday.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Every teacher is on at least one teacher team so that every teacher has a voice in the decision making process. The  selections of appropriate assessments are discussed at grade conferences, lesson studies, assessment, cabinet, and  vertical team meetings. Once an assessment(s) has been selected, all pedagogues decide on the type of professional  development needed to prepare, implement and evaluate the assessment effectively. Time is allocated to design,  revise and norm rubrics to ensure continuity throughout the grades.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40        Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 215, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. 215 will support parents and families of Title I students by:     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing  technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;     maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;         provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State   accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality  Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;     host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise   parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right  to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118  and other applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act;  schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the  Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;              Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:     holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;    hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school   year;     encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-  Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  supporting or hosting Family Day events;      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43           establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;    encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;    providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their   children’s progress;     developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about   school activities and student progress;     providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a   format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.   School-Parent Compact (SPC)   P.S. 215, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments. Parents are informed of the Title I program from the  beginning of the school year through materials sent home and PTA meetings with members of the school staff in  attendance. Teachers are encouraged to communicate the Title I program goal and the need for parent involvement.  Multiple opportunities to discuss and participate in the Title I program development are offered with the support of  the Family Worker regular communications in the newsletter, calendar, workshops and daily face to face interactions.

The objective and  rationale of these programs is to facilitate English Language Acquisition on the part of ELLs as  well as to maximize their opportunities for success on the NYSESLAT and other state  assessments.  Parents and their children will be invited through all programs through a variety of  means; translated letters and flyers sent home with children, mailed home, handed out at all  PTA events and meetings as well as at school gatherings REMIND, Website postings, Twitter  and automated phonecalls in 23 languages will be programmed to go home through the school  service. Starting in October, P.S. 215 will implement a Saturday Enrichment program for  Immigrant Families, ELLs and their parents.    For 2018/2019, PS215 will update the Family Literacy Program with the support of the local  NYC librarian and the PS 215 Family Coordinator to create a more interactive  learning experience for parents and children. Conceptually, the program will include language  development through direct instruction and hands on activities aligned with the  Common Core curriculum to provide support for parents and students alike. The after school  program will be implemented on Wednesday and Thursday from 2:30 pm-4:30 pm from  November through April. PS 215 will focus on small group instruction for second language  acquisition to better support students in achieving higher results on the NYSESLAT and  ELA State Exams. Students will be grouped by ENL level as determined by the NYSESLAT,  with no more than two levels in each grade level group to facilitate targeted language  development.  In this way, specific language skills can be addressed in line with grade  level expectations as determined by the Common Core State Standards,    Materials to be used are computers, ipads, smartboards, textbooks, workbooks and various art  supplies. All instruction will be in English with native language support as needed. The iReady  program creates and individual learning path for students and identifies the skills they need  supported. The skill strengthening exercises generated by the program will be used with groups  of 4 to 5 students for further practice and development.  Attendance will be kept for every  session and kept with a copy of the weekly date reports from iReady, tracking student progress.    NYS ESL teachers will be hired for each after school class. We will maintain small class sizes  of under 20 students to maximize the instructional  benefits. If ENL teachers are not all available  from within the school community or from nearby schools, general education teachers will  be  hired on a per session basis but will be required to work and plan closely with the ENL  teachers to provide consistent and strong second language acquisition support. If classroom  teachers are needed, they will be matched with the grade level to maintain a consistent content  area knowledge and will act as the primary afterschool teacher for that group from 2:30-4:30pm.  Classroom Teachers who completed training in ENL strategies and methodology through the  Generation Ready program will be enlisted to participate. ENL Teachers will meet weekly with  classroom teachers to plan for afterschool classes and review students' progress through written  work and data analysis from the iReady program.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:               In order to promote academic excellence and quality instruction, Title III program teachers and  staff responsible for the delivery of instruction and services to ELLs will receive training in:  Technology: As school wide goal, Teachers will participate in training in new software and  programs in use to meet the school goal of meaningful integration of technology in the classroom  and throughout the school community. Specifically workshops supporting the iReady program,  Flowcabulary, NEWSLA, Interactive whiteboard use and basic computer programs will be held  to broaden the knowledge base for pedagogues. This series is included in the school-wide  budget.   Common Core Learning Standards for ELL Students - Through a series of workshops given by  internal and external Professional Development providers and Educational Consultant Pamela  Kinnon, both ENL and Classroom teachers will work with the components and structure of the  common core standards and will engage in creating rigorous tasks in literacy and mathematics.  Teachers will realign standards with content; design tasks/rubrics via unwrapping the standards  and will create curriculum maps via a mapping backwards technique that outlines the required  skills needed by students in order to successfully complete the unit. This series is included in the  school-wide goals and is funded by the larger school budget. Differentiation - This series of  workshops will focus on ESL teachers refreshing their toolkit of  instructional methodologies to  meet the needs of all ELLs, including SwELLs. The monthly sessions will be given  by professional workshop providers, DOE representatives and turnkeyed teacher-led workshops.  Additional support will be provided by the weekly cycle of observation of the new strategies'  implementation  by the educational consultants. The resulting feedback will be used to further  adapt curriculum and drive instruction. Training will take place during the school day, after  school and on Mondays during our Professional Development for teachers and paraprofessionals.  Attendance will be taken at each event and kept in the Professional Development binder in the  main office along with copies of materials for reference. Consultants specific to ENL teachers  will be included in the Title III budget.   The Common Core Learning Standard aligned materials used for the standalone classwork,  designed to promote Second Language Acquisition are: The iReady and its' skill support  materials for small groups as determined by student data. The ENL afterschool program also will  use iReady skills-based practice work for small groups, Finish Line for ELLs 2.0 English  Proficiency Practice as well as teacher-created materials to support ELLs second language  acquisition. Materials will be provided from the Title II budget, augmented by the school-wide  budget as needed.

Our Parents as Partners workshop series will continue with  representatives from the Mayor's office of immigrant Affairs and other Community-based  organizations including but not limited to WANY, MOIA, Safe Horizons, YAI, Chinese  American Planning Council and more, pending availability and school need. We have adjusted  our hours for the workshops to include more working parents based on their input from 2 surveys  and will include an additional option for parents to participate in our Family Literacy  Program, dependant on parent response.  Our intent is to provide a broader base of support and  increase the network of assistance to our non-native born families and assure them of the  welcome and support available from our school community.  Interpreters will be available for  select events throughout the year, including our school staff members as well as professionals  from The Big Word. Our increased digital presence will allow for greater communication and  more access to events and information from PS215, also created in response to the parent's  requests. The school website includes translation options and materials, the REMIND app allows  for two-way communication in 20+ languages, which creates opportunities for meaningful  interaction. Monthly workshops will vary from daytime to evening hours to accommodate all  parents' schedules and are planned for September, October, November, December, January,  February, March, April and May.Parents will be notified by translated letters as to when and  where these workshops will take place as well as by newly translated automatic phone  calls, paper and digital calendars, social media and the REMIND app. Agendas, attendance  sheets and copies of invitations in parents’ preferred languages will be kept by the ENL  department and the Parent Coordinator. All events, services and activities will be planned and  implemented as a team throughout all levels of the school community to increase communication  at all levels.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide   instructional planning for your ELLs?  PS215 is now an iReady school with full implementation from k to 5th grades. In this second year of the iReady program, we will continue to use Fountas and Pinnel to assess the  literacy skills of our ENL students. This assessment is done 3 times a year for all students in every grade and is used to determine each student's current independent and instructional  reading level. The iReady assessments are scheduled 4 times a year, however individual assessments are completed as needed throughout the school year to determine student  progress in Math and ELA . The quantitative data creates the opportunity for deeper analysis of student progress in language acquisition including reading levels, phonemic awareness,  reading readiness skills and writing skills Teachers use this information to better group the students during guided reading, writing groups, math instruction and for lesson  differentiation. The quantitative data also reveals how the students, including ENLs, are learning reading via phonetic instruction and how they transfer this information onto a written  piece.  The iReady and Fountas and Pinnell assessments are used to identify students who are below benchmark and determine the exact measures needed to provide them with Tier  II interventions and if necessary Tier III interventions. The data is collection begins after the initial NYSITELL testing is completed school-wide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         ENL and Classroom teachers work closely together to support ENL learners with hands on support from administration. Staff developers, coaches and workshop providers also support  all teachers in their curriculum development, data collection, analysis and assessment of ENLs' progress and needs.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to   identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   We evaluate the success of our program based on achievement  percentile and number of students (1) making progress in English language proficiency, (2) attaining English language  proficiency and (3)NYS ELA exam. The data used for this determination includes but is not limited to: NYSESLAT, ELA, classroom assessments and observations, iReady individual  profiles, ELL Periodic Assessments, Fountas and Pinnell benchmarks as other formative and summative assessments.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Small group instruction inside the classroom and during pull-out instruction and materials are adapted to address students' needs. Targeted instruction based on their specific needs  generated from the iReady program provide significant support to struggling students. Additional interventions and supports are developed by ENL teachers in tandem with Classroom  teachers to allow access for all learners. Student progress is assessed at 4 crucial points throughout the year and afterschool programs and groupings are based on these results.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support   Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   We collect data from a wide variety of sources e.g., NYS ELA Exam, NYSESLAT, NYS Periodic ELL Assessments, iReady, Fountas and Pinnell, formative and summative assessments,  conferencing etc. With appropriate analysis and interpretation of data,  P.S. 215's educators can make informed decisions that positively affect student outcomes. Professional  development supports teachers in analysis of the assessment results and student work samples to identify and address learning difficulties and drive instruction.  Specific Professional  Development for both new and veteran classroom teachers continues to address ELLs and SWDs with special focus on Special Education ELLs'. These groups have been identified as an  area of need within the school community and appropriate resources and care will be provided them. In addition, ENL teachers will participate in professional learning cycles both in  house from consultants and through District training opportunities.  School staff continues to update our Response to Intervention Framework, reflecting the current updates as  required by DOE mandates. Students (including ELLs) are selected for TIER II or TIER III interventions if they require targeted or intensive interventions in order to meet common core  standards or individual benchmark levels.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].     The results of the NYSESLAT/NYSITELL Assessments, NYS ELA scores, NYS Math scores, iReady and Fountas and Pinnell,  are used to inform instruction across grade levels. As in former  years, the number of ELL students continues to decrease significantly by the 5th grade, ( in the current school year: 52 students in 1  st   Grade and 5 students in 5th grade) with the  largest number of students in the expanding level of proficiency. However, PS215 is experiencing an overall increase in the number of Immigrant Families and ENL students entering at  Kindergarten. In addition, the number of students entering PS215 in grades 4 and 5 at Beginning levels of English is also increasing.  The data from the ELA and NYSESLAT exams shows  students are struggling with writing in the short responses and essay questions. Therefore, during instruction, we stress the skills necessary to increase reading and writing proficiency,  using differentiated small group as well as 1:1 instruction.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Weekly Grade meetings, biweekly Data Inquiry team meetings and Vertical Team meetings meet regularly to share data and determine next steps as a school community.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   P.S. 215 has a Freestanding ENL Program with integrated ELA and standalone time according to their ENL level per the  NYSESLAT and/or NYSITELL Exam.  Heterogeneous groups within each grade or grade band are serviced by certified  ESL Teachers who work in conjunction with classroom teachers to provide substantive support for students in the  language acquisition process.  Core curriculum is scaffolded for ENL learners to provide further support in the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         classroom.  In 2018, PS215 will implement a new common core aligned curriculum, designed specifically for  Second Language Acquisition for ENL students. This curriculum, based on the SIOP method, will use grade level  content to as the basis for learning language structure and syntax. In this way, students will receive further  reinforcement in the grade level content and create opportunities to deepen their learning while acquiring English.  Technology is also implemented as a support through software specifically designed to target their individual learning  goals across the content areas. Teachers and students benefit by the built-in supports provided within the structure of  the school community.        b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A    2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Our primary goal in supporting our English language learners is to ensure that we have a highly supportive and  welcoming environment for all learners. The administrative cabinet meets to discuss the NYESLAT results and plan for the  placement or movement of English Language Learners as needed. Students are placed in accordance with parent choice and  instructional periods required.  The schedules for the ENL teachers that are pushing-in to general education classrooms for the integrated ENL minutes is  completed by the Assistant Principal supervising ENL, the STARS scheduler and the ESL teacher to ensure that students are  being serviced in accordance with CR Part 154.  Walk-throughs, formals and informal observations are ongoing throughout the  school year in order to ensure that students are being provided with optimum instruction in second language allocation.  Students entering our school from other New York City schools are screened during registration in order to identify any  language needs and academic levels.  To ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels, the school team  devises a schedule that prioritizes, above all else compliance with and adherence to the mandated time allotments for  servicing the English Language proficiency levels that characterize our ELL Population. 360 minutes per week are allocated for  Entering, and Emerging ELL students; 180 minutes per week are allocated for Transitioning and Expanding ELL students; 90  minutes  per week are allocated for Commanding ELL students. For all in classroom support, the ENL teacher and classroom  teacher work together to provide scaffolded materials for students at all levels to access grade level common core  aligned content.  iReady is also used to provide specific feedback on student progress in support of individual student  academic goals. In 2018, the ENL teachers will implement a new standalone curriculum, specifically designed for Second  Language Acquisition and aligned with common core curriculum. Commanding students receive individualized instruction with  the data from iReady, targeting their specific areas of need and working in small groups with their certified ENL Teacher.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      With our content-area instruction encourage our students to develop higher order thinking in all subject areas while at the  same time acquiring the English Language.  With regard to content area instruction, our ENL teachers use a variety of  instructional approaches to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards,  such as The Total Physical Response (TPR); The Whole Language Approach; The Natural Approach and the Language  Experience Approach.  Teachers use visual displays (i.e. graphs, charts, photos) in the lessons and assignments to support the  oral or written message. Visual/graphic organizers are used before presenting a reading passage. The additional contextual  information in visual form makes the comprehension task easier. In addition, the teachers use cooperative learning strategies  i.e. Peer Buddy/Small Group Activities/Pairs and Threes as well as other interactive strategies, such as KWL Charts, Role Play,  and Games. For 2018, PS215 is reinvigorating our standalone ENL program by introducing a new curriculum, designed to foster  second language acquisition using the content aligned with the common core standards. This SIOP-based program uses cross-  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      content themes and project-based learning to reinforce grade level content in an accessible manner while expanding the  development of English across the four modalities.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      At the beginning of each school year we analyze our ELL population using NYSITELL, NYSESLAT results, Home Language  Identification  Survey,  school history and parent interviews. We order NYS exams in native languages, such as math, science  and social studies.  In-house school staff speak several languages prevalent in the school community and we provide native  language support when needed with students. Several software programs in use school-wide provide portions of their  programming in multiple native languages.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Our instructional plan for SIFE (Students with Interrupted Formal Education) students includes building a supportive  environment that responds to the immediate social, cultural and linguistic needs of the students. Bilingual staff members, in  addition to ENL teachers, support the students. SIFE students are partnered with peers or classmates who can support and  further integrate them into their grade and school community. In order to help them accelerate and catch up to their peers,  they are grouped with newcomer students during ENL instruction and provided with remedial instruction wherever necessary.  The curriculum is adapted so that students learn critical content in a way that is effective, accessible and age-appropriate.  Students  are provided with intensive literacy and language instruction which stresses the five components of reading; phonemic  awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. This increases student access to literacy-rich environments and  print materials, increasing language development and proficiency.   Students in US schools for less than 1 year are considered Newcomers. The mandated instructional time is  provided during the school day. The ENL teacher works closely with the classroom teacher to make sure that the student’s  needs are addressed.  Newcomer books, as well as other instructional materials are provided by the ENL teachers and are  incorporated into the classroom. The classroom curriculum is scaffolded by the ESL pedagogues to provide further access  points for ENL learners. Programs such as iReady and Go Math provide individualized support for students, meeting them at  their level with work  designed to bring them up to grade level.   The ENL teacher works jointly with the classroom teacher and service support providers to support ELLs with 4-6 years in the  ENL program. Long-term ELLs benefit from the individualized learning path created in the iReady program. All teachers use the  data to target specific areas needing support or improvement. Long-term ELLs may appear fluent, but may be lacking in their  English comprehension, vocabulary and writing skills. These students need language support to make gains in language and  content area. They are identified and receive interventions which target their area of need with data form iReady, Go Math,  unit exams and teacher-created assessments.  These interventions include AIS/RTI services in Reading and Math.  Teachers use  scaffolding and continue to use linguistic cues to support language. Students at this level are given the opportunity for more  language input.  Teachers differentiate their instruction by using lessons that scaffold academic language and  broaden vocabulary. ESL teachers specifically support second language acquisition development through direct instruction  during the standalone mandated minutes.   Former ELLs receive testing accommodations, such as separate location. Moreover, former ELLS are further supported through  an ongoing collaboration between ENL providers and classroom teachers which includes common planning time,  cultural  responsiveness and continued implementation of ENL strategies for 90 minutes per week.  Commanding students benefit from  the individualized learning path created in the iReady program. Both the classroom and ESL teachers use the data to target  specific areas needing support or improvement.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      Instructional Components  • Language Development activities that address the four language strands: reading, writing, speaking, and listening.  • General education classroom teachers in addition to the ENL teachers provide extensive literacy lessons differentiated by  needs  that expose children to the actual structure of the second language.  Lessons take into consideration and build upon the ELLs’  background knowledge and expand their English vocabulary.  Opportunity for discussions is frequent and elaborate responses  are encouraged.  Students are monitored on an on-going basis and instruction is modified based on academic need.  • The reading and writing workshop model promotes second language development through natural and explicit exposure to  reading and writing that is meaningful, standards-based as well as modified for  ELL students.  -Use of technology to provide multiple access points and individual support in the learning process. PS 215 will add th use of  software that we have seen successfully reaching our SwELLs, specifically the Imagine Learning program.   • Teachers further develop the acquired vocabulary and content through student conferences.  • Extended use of scaffolding methods during components of literacy program.  Learners are supported through scaffolding of  instruction that ensures that needed elements are in place before constructing meaning of the whole topic.     The Classroom Environment  The appearance of the environment in which ELLs receive their instruction is just as important as the lessons taught there. A  positive, organized and risk-free environment denotes respect for the learners.  It is a classroom that motivates the learner  and enriches their knowledge about concepts, language development and ideas. Creating such an environment entails  arranging a practical physical layout supplying diverse materials and supplies and encourages  students to have a sense of  belonging, ownership and independence. The physical appearance of the room should promote language and become  comprehensible to the students whose native language is other than English. These include:  • A meeting area to promote whole class instruction  • Children’s work folders, located in a specific, neatly organized, visible area  • Leveled classroom libraries with culturally relevant stories available for their use  • Print rich environment provided by charts, student work and content area word walls  • Furniture arranged to allow easy access and visibility by the teacher in clusters for group discussions and cooperative  learning  • A flow of the day denoting the activities of the day  • Charts specific to unit of study in literacy and other content areas  • Word walls with high frequency words aided by visuals as  needed for ELLs at various levels  In addition to the above students with disabilities (SWD) who are also ELLs are provided with:  Vocabulary picture cards; bilingual picture dictionaries, bilingual glossaries;  as well as provided with limited number of  choices, less complex assignments and assessments; single concept instruction, repetition, modified speech/ word  enunciation, additional scaffolding and modeling and or guided practice.   Currently, we have 2 students that require a bilingual placement; therefore an alternate placement paraprofessional is  provided for those students.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELLs identified as Special Education Students, or SwELLs, with special needs are in general education classroom,  Integrated Co- teaching classrooms as well as self-contained classroom.  Our school recognizes the importance of flexible programming and  uses the full continuum of special education services to meet students needs in the least restrictive environment.  SwELLs that  are in an integrated co-teaching classroom are scheduled to receive push in services.  Careful attention is given to ensure that  ELL services do not conflict with their required special education mandated services. All service providers, including ENL  teachers, are asked to complete a master schedule for each student which are located in the IEP Coordinator's office.  Because  ENL sessions are longer than any other service delivered in our school, ENL providers are asked to schedule their sessions prior  to any related service provider i.e. speech, OT counseling etc. Once all the services for each SwELLs are scheduled, each  student's scheduled is carefully reviewed to ensure that there is no over lapping of services.  All of our SwELLs are educated  alongside their general education peers for the following subject areas including but not limited to, gym, art, music and  technology.   The needs of these students are accommodated by including smaller group size, the presence of a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      paraprofessional during ENL periods, specialized modifications and scaffolding materials like graphic organizers, partner work,  technological resources, and visual support. Materials used are photo libraries for visuals, hands on materials, games for  learning, leveled books, technological resources such as Smart boards, websites like Brainpop.com and using the Internet for  learning and research.  This year, PS215 will add the use of Imagine Learning software to our self-contained classrooms, based  on past success with this population. ENL teachers are provided with copies of students' Individual Education Plans and work  closely with the classroom teachers and/ or service providers to ensure that instruction is delivered appropriately,  expectations are high and goals are achieved in a timely manner.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted interventions are services provided in the classroom for our ELLs during the regular school day by the student's  classroom teacher. This may be modified instruction, small group work, guided lessons, and guided reading groups, with  supplemental material being used for extra reinforcement.  Students are assessed on a bi/weekly basis using specific probes.  Teachers must maintain records of the supplemental work being provided, (guided reading plans, conference notes, etc.).  Struggling students, including ELLs, and those identified  at risk for not meeting grade level standards receive intensive  intervention services (TIER III). Once these students are identified, the ENL Teacher and and the RTI Intervention Specialist  design a program that will meet the individual needs of these struggling students in the classroom. These students  may also  receive Academic Intervention Services (AIS) if necessary.  AIS services are available in math, science, reading, and  writing.  ELLs in all subgroups are entitled to receive services, including newcomer ELLs, students with 4-6 years of service, ELLs  in special education, and SIFE children. AIS teachers employ various instructional strategies to ensure that they meet the needs  of students at all proficiency levels. AIS groups are kept small and use individualized instruction. We are also in the process of  implementing ELA software school-wide that will create an individual learning path for students. The program has specific  modules for ELLs and SWDs to provide further support in school and at home. Additionally, we will provide strategy specific  Professional Development for Teachers from both internal and external providers.    The following is a list of targeted interventions:  ELA  1.

Science resources are provided for at risk students in the form of online activities as well as in print  3. Highlighted tape is used to note key points in texts  4. Student content vocabulary word lists      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      In the past several years we have had a Saturday Program that included parents of ELLs accompanying their children. Activities  include:  small group instruction to address needs, language development activities as well as arts and crafts.  Moreover last  year we offered an ENL after school program 2 days a week.  Students worked through their individual academic plan an din  small groups to meet their language and the demands of the common core standards. Pending budget allocations for  2018/2019, we have decided to continue this program this year. Additionally, more project-based learning will be   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      incorporated in the afterschool program which, per the SIOP method, will build language proficiency within the context of the  grade level content.    For a second year, we will continue to use the iReady program and Ready New York to support students development and use  the accompanying data for analysis . Pending further analysis of student performance for school year 2017/2018, we plan to  implement Imagine Learning for ESL and SWD learners based on feedback from teachers. The classroom and ENL teachers saw  much stronger gains with SwELLs using this program as opposed to the iReady program so we will adjust our support  accordingly. Combined with deeper professional development with targeted strategies for ENL learners, we intend to provide  the support needed to improve ELLs and SWD ELLs English development as evidenced by higher numbers of students scoring in  the Commanding range in the NYSESLAT and higher scores on the ELA exam.           10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?         11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   All Ells are afforded equal access to all our school programs.  All after school clubs, music, art, shows, plays, and family  involvement evenings  are open to the entire academic community. These notices are translated into parents' native  languages. There is a Title III program  that consists entirely of ELLs. The Title III after school program will  serve 30 students.  We offer an ELA and Math test prep program in grades 3-5.  Over 70% of ELLs participated in the test prep after school  program in grades 3-5.    In past years all newcomer, beginner, and struggling ELLs were invited to participate in the after school program where they  receive scaffolded instruction in the content areas as well as literacy and math. In 2017/2018, we invited targeted student  groups to focus on specific skills with students struggling with comprehension and writing. The program usually runs from  October through April. The ELL After School program will now consist of two parts:  students will spend time working on their  individualized learning plan with the  support of small group instruction on targeted needs as determined from data and  project-based learning projects that are cross content, and common core aligned (math, science, social studies, art, literature,  or health). This hands-on part of the program is used to motivate the student to write as part of their finished product and is  used to improve the writing skill necessary for English language proficiency. Once the students' projects are finished,  they share their products with the other students in an interactive format to further increase comprehension and academic  vocabulary development. This sharing part of the program is used to help the student practice and improve the skills necessary  for English language proficiency as well as to improve the students' academic self-esteem.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  At P.S. 215 we realize the advantages of using technology in the classroom, especially for our ELL students. All of our  classrooms are equipped with SMART Boards.  Using SMART Boards in the classrooms engages our ELLs because it uses an  interactive multi-sensory technology.  We use programs and websites such as Newsla, Flowcabulary, Starfall and Brainpop, we  also use multicultural literature, author studies, such as Eric Carle; Leo Lionni, Nonfiction literature: Time for Kids; newspapers;  scholastic news for kids, and Audio Listening Centers: read alouds; read alongs  and music. We use instructional software such  as Go Math as well as the iReady ELA software program which creates individual learning paths for students, data for teachers  and parents and is readily accessible form students homes as well as within the school. additionally, Imagine Learning will be  used this year to support the self-contained classrooms with SwELLs.  •     Starfall- website that teachers students’ how to read using a phonetic approach; contains features, such as phonics games  and online interactive books  .              NEWSLA-an interactive website that scaffolds current events and supplemental non-fiction reading, some  native         language support is available  •     BrainPop: Website that provides English and Spanish educational support in the form of educational movies, leveled                  quizzes, games and activities in all academic subjects.  •     Time for Kids: a news magazine geared toward K-5 students that offer age appropriate news stories and current events.  •     Scholastic News:  A weekly magazine that contains both fiction and non-fiction articles and stories.  •     Audio Listening Centers: Designated space within the classroom where students use audio equipment such as headphones  to listen to grade appropriate material.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         •     Bilingual texts:  Books that contain text written in English and a student’s native language.                                All of the above instructional materials are used with all ELLs and former ELLs to various degrees.      For 2018, PS215 is reinvigorating our standalone ENL program by introducing a new curriculum, designed to foster second  language acquisition using the content aligned with the common core standards. This SIOP-based program uses cross-content  themes and project-based learning to reinforce grade level content in an accessible manner while expanding the development  of English across the four modalities.          13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native Language support is provided in the form of peer-interaction whenever necessary.  The use of technology, recordings,  bilingual dictionaries and text also supports ENL instruction.  Correspondence is sent home in parents' native language. We  have use of an in house bilingual staff to provide translation services. If necessary staff members are instructed to use the DOE  translation unit and phone service.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   All students, including ELLs, are placed in grade and age-appropriate classes with their peers. We currently have 4 ENL  providers on staff;  Janine Gossett services Kindergarten; Beth Kopelowitz services grade 1; Angela Chung services grades 2 and  3; and Danielle Tuomi  services grades 4 and 5. Each group consists of no more than two consecutive grade levels.  Materials  are age appropriate, and are used to build capacity and comprehension.  We use scaffolded Journeys and Ready Gen  curriculum in line with the classroom teachers as well as targeted ENL resources such as NYSESLAT Prep books and software  programs specific to their needs.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Although District 75 school PS234 is co-located in our building, they occupy only 5 classrooms. PS215 works with PS234 to  share access to the cafeteria, auditorium and schoolyard with very low impact on our students.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Emphasis is placed on creating a positive home and school partnership. Communication is provided in the students' native  language to enhance involvement in school wide activities. ELLs have the support of all school staff members. The parent  coordinator provides information to the the parents of ELLs.   We offer parent workshops for newly enrolled ELLs at the  beginning of school. We also hold a "meet and greet" for the students and their parents. increasing the opportunities for  interaction within the school community.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?     Elementary schools do not offer language electives.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Currently, P.S. 215 does not have dual language programs.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development (PD) is offered to all teachers and Paraprofessionals at PS 215.  PD is incorporated during Monday  afternoons, PD days and others throughout the school year. ENL Strategies and techniques, use of Technology with ELLS and  how to support ELL class participation are topics planned for the 2018/2019 school year. Consultants and ENL Specialists will  also give PD for classroom teachers to meet the mandated hours of PD in the ELL content area.     ENL consultants, teachers and administrators provide professional development for all personnel who work with ELLs during  select faculty conferences, admin periods, and instructional team meetings.  This support team will prepare presentations,  suggest methods and strategies for working with ELLs in addition to supporting school staff. The ELL professional development  received at these instructional team meetings will be turnkeyed to remaining classroom teachers and paraprofessionals. These  workshops include topics, such as: cultural awareness, modifying Instruction to increase comprehension, building and teaching  vocabulary and the use of technology in the classroom specifically to support ELLS.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  ENL teachers provide support and are available to staff, students and parents to assist ELLs as they transition from elementary  to middle school. ENL teachers, administrators and secretaries consult with parents, teachers and students on issues related to  transitioning to middle school.  The guidance counselor, social worker and psychologist support the social aspects of coming  into a new country or new school. ENL teachers and the parent coordinator also provide information to parents, teachers and  other school staff about ENL programs in middle schools, exam information, the general transition period and creating support  networks in their new school. ENL teachers and the Parent Coordinator reach out to parents about any issues/questions they  may have regarding their child’s future.  Moreover, we send translated middle school fliers; middle school application  information  in the parents' native language.    Several professional development sessions are scheduled with the entire school staff which includes School Administration,  Parent coordinator, Secretaries, Para-Professionals, related service providers, social worker and school psychologist, general  education and special education teachers, under the direction of the ELL Instructors,  Assistant Principal and Professional  Development team.   2018-2019 ELL Professional Development Calendar and Plan topics include:  •     Cultural Awareness and Responsiveness  •     Social and classroom interaction for ELLs  •     The 4 domains (Vocabulary, comprehension, writing and oral language of English language instruction)  •     ESL Instructional approaches and methodologies.   •     ESL Performance Definitions  •     Language acquisition process for writing  •     RTI and ELLS  •     ESL instruction and the Common Core Learning Standards  •     Accelerating ELL student achievement  •     Setting high expectations for our ELLs  •     Best Practices for Teaching ELLs  All agendas and sign in sheets as well as copies of materials and hand-outs are maintained in a Professional Development  Binder located in the main office.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   ENL teachers will provide annual individual meetings with parent of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas on  Tuesday afternoons during out parent outreach allocated time. The main office is maintained as welcome place for ELL parents  for assistance with the multiple aspects of integrating into the school community. Increased communication with teachers is  further encouraged by the addition of translated letters to support parent knowledge of student progress, community events  and activities.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   To increase access and encourage ENL and Immigrant Parent involvement, PS215 is developing a Family literacy program in  tandem with the local branch of NYC Library. At this time, ENL pedagogues, the Assistant Principal supervising ENLs and the  Family Coordinator are working with eh local librarian to create a program of interest and in support of our families.   Records  of the meetings and any ensuing issues will be kept in a secure location with the associated ENL documentation. This program  will support the second language acquisition of the families with their students in hopes that the overall increase of literacy  will encourage a focus on education and school involvement. We intend to provide an open door for parents to express their  needs and the opportunity for our school to address them promptly.       P.S. 215 welcomes parents of all children to be a member of our academic community. In the last 3 years we have increased  the amount of translated correspondence sent home to parents and created a new structures in place within the office to  support increased access for parents of all languages. We provide translators for all our parents that have expressed a need for  help on their HLIS. Parents are a valuable force in the whole education of their child in and out of school. There are activities at  night and during the day that parents can be part of. This year we plan to hold the following workshops: Tips for Parent  Teacher conferences; Parent Survey Assistance and Dial a Teacher. The following programs are specifically designed to foster  communication among parents of ELLs.  Every year we have Multicultural night where parents prepare food from their native  countries  and were available to exchange recipes with other parents. On Saturday mornings we offer an ENL enrichment  program for parents and their children; parents are informed of ENL activities that take place during the school day as well as  given an opportunity to ask questions and address concerns.  On Monday and Tuesday evenings, Parent Enrichment nights  offer a variety academic, arts and wellness workshops for parents to participate in with their children.            Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.     The ENL program at PS 215 has been historically successful with most of our students attaining proficiency and testing out of the  ESL program by 3rd grade. The number of students in our ELL program at the upper grade range is significantly lower than the  students in the lower grades. Traditionally, our number of ELL students at the entering level decreases dramatically after one year  of ELL instruction. Those students progress rapidly to subsequent levels and many pass the NYSESELAT exam. However, the  resulting data from the last three years precipitated an in-depth examination of our ENL program resulting in a shifting of academic  support of ELLs, through a realignment of the available ELL scaffolded materials, targeted PD specific to ELL strategies for classroom  teachers and increased use of technology both in the classroom and at home .   However, the population is shifting and we now have an increased number of students entering in Kindergarten as well as  increasing numbers of students entering upper grades 4 and 5 with low or no English. Implementation of the  iReady program allows for individualized learning paths to support students in reaching their grade level and allows for immediate,  short and long term feedback to drive instruction. Continued focus in PD for classroom teachers in the use of ENL strategies and  teaching methods will provide additional support for new, long term and former ENL students on all grade levels.  Continued updating of ENL teachers pedagogy will also support reaching students on all grade levels.  Implementation of the new   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62                       standalone curriculum designed for second language acquisition using the SIOP method will also better support English language  development across the modalities. By providing a stronger base in language development, PS215 intends to improve the  NYSESLAT and ELA performance of current and former ELLs.   Once a student becomes a former ELL, we have seen their high success rate on the standardized state exams particularly in Math  and Science as a reflection of the success of this program and good teaching strategies within our classrooms. The ELL program is  ongoing because as students attain success and move on in their educational careers, they are replaced by newly admitted ELL  students.   Although most students show growth within the ENL program (progress from level to level; many of these students fail to attain a  proficiency level above a 2 in ELA. Our current focus is to apply the new skills of the new staff members, enhanced curriculum,  more frequent data collection and analysis, additional ENL strategies and technology across the classrooms to provide the  additional support needed by our current and former ELL population.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Antonella Bove, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.

At PS215 we use the Home Language Survey, ATS Reports, Student Emergency Contact Cards, Parent Survey,  Teacher input and Parent Interactions in formal and informal situations to determine the language of preference  and dominance among our Parent community. The PTA also welcomes to the school community and shares  information regarding feedback from new parents throughout the year. The ENL teachers are particularly diligent  in identifying those parents requiring assistance as part of their interaction with students for academic and social  reasons. At selected school events, professional translators are provided to further encourage and support  participation of families from our entire school community.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Regular meeting with our staff by grade team, paraprofessionals is held for workshops and professional development.  These guidelines will be included as part of our ongoing communication with staff members. Teachers receive their  students' names listed with the home language for each student to indicate those who request or require information  sent home in a language other than English. Office staff uses lists by class to indicate the copies needed by room and  per language to further ensure communication between the school and our families is strengthened.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information.

The Language Access Coordinator is trained to implement and inform the school community about the language  access services available for the school and the parents. The LAC will receive updated training and verify that all  information is disseminated to parents directly, necessary policies are posted and clearly visible in the school building,  and that all members of the school teaching, support staff and leadership are informed of their responsibilities in  regards to the regulations and their implementation. Brochures, flyers, letters and invitations are translated in  multiple languages before being sent home by backpack, mail and digital formats. ENL teachers and school staff also  request parents' preferred method and means of contact to ensure choice and accessibility for all members of the  school community.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       The ENL Administrator, ENL teachers, and classroom teachers will regularly ask for satisfaction levels of  communication with ENL Parents in informal and formal events and face-to-face interactions. The main office staff will  also be required to remind previous parents and inform new parents of the multiple options available to them to  support communication within the school community when sharing all levels of information. PTA members will  continue welcoming the ENL families and communicate with school leadership the change in response rate from this  group of parents. Translators will be made available for select events to further support communication with  Immigrant families. The Parent Survey will also be used at the end of the year to assess the progress of this initiative.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69
