This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission Statement   Section 4: CEP Overview      We believe that all children can and will learn in a nurturing, safe, and risk-free environment where they are  challenged to their maximum potential. We are committed to a school-home partnership through which students are  supported to meet high standards of excellence. This philosophy is extended to our entire and diverse school  population, including our bilingual, ENL, and special needs students, as well as to our staff, parents and the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      community at large.

Our work will continue to focus on strengthening our curricula to reflect engaging and meaningful tasks  and assessments that meet the needs of all learners, reflecting how students learn best, and maximizing opportunities  for student driven instruction by making on-demand adjustments to units of study and lesson plans to meet the  instructional and social-emotional needs of all students.       We will also continue to support student achievement by developing differentiated tasks that reflect students'  interests, learning styles, and rigor. To ensure cohesiveness across classrooms and teacher practice, teachers will  continue to engage in professional learning opportunities that offer effective questioning strategies and  differentiation of instruction aimed to improve student learning and performance across all subjects.                   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 10X008   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1001   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Strengths   The school offers varied and plentiful opportunities for parent participation. During the school year there are many  opportunities for community engagement via parent workshops (i.e. CCLS, standardized testing, test  preparation/practice), family nights, parent classes (ESL, GED). Parent engagement is extended to offer parents Yoga  classes, parenting sessions on social/emotional child development, etc.       Needs   Based on the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, there is a need to increase parent participation, outreach, and  involvement through the scheduling of events and activities that are responsive to parents' needs, namely visiting  classrooms to observe instruction and volunteering their time to support school-wide events. Such efforts will focus  on improving a transparent and collaborative relationship to support and improve student learning and achievement.  In this area, parent involvement was below the citywide average by 0.46.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.   By June 2019 we will continue to build stronger partnerships with families and expand opportunities for parent  engagement so that parents and families feel welcomed and encouraged to engage with the school in an effort to  strengthen the home-school connection and impact learning; which will result in a 20% increase in parent involvement  compared to the previous year's participation as measured by attendance at invited activities/venues.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20.

Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy      Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 8 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. Our school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.          Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. 8’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    P.S. 8 will support parents and families of Title I students by:     Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;     Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and   decision making in support of the education of their children;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54            Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress; (Newsletters, RTI/AIS Notices/Progress Reports)     Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;   Parental Involvement and School Quality   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input.

To address this gap we propose further developing English  language and literacy.  That is, the participants will be strengthened in their use of content- obligatory AND content-compatible vocabulary both orally and in writing.  Using domain  specific literature (at no cost to the project), the program will integrate oral and written language  instruction into content area teaching through scaffolded tasks and activities that require the  engagement of language comprehension skills and the understanding of content concepts.  The  program will include summative assessments for content understandings and language  development.  These will be forwarded to the “home room” teachers of the participants to  support needs-based instruction in the classrooms.

To address the specific needs of the  ELLs in our school, we will target ELA, but also the disciplines of Mathematics and  Science.  Our ELLs need to learn the content and domain specific language of mathematics and  science.  Learning is mediated through LANGUAGE. Through Title III funding, the  supplementary before school and Saturday programs described in Part B will include two  professional development series for two grade bands (1-2 & 3-5). The workshop series will train  teachers to plan rigorous, domain specific tasks and lessons that align the New Language  Progressions, and the CCLS for ELA and math by delineating TWO goals: + develop their  students' abilities in English and, + develop the specific language the students need for  mathematical and science discourse.   The two grade band specific PD series will draw from the  following downloadable resources: from Engage New York – * Scaffolding Instruction for  ELLs: Resource Guide for ELA, * Scaffolding Instruction for ELLs: Resource Guide for  Mathematics; from NYSED:  * New Language Progressions, * CCLS for Mathematics & ELA.

ELL parents retreat from meaningful school participation due to, among  other factors, language barriers and their own limited formal education.  The Title III parent  programs will enhance parents' capacity to promote their children's achievement and enhance  parents' confidence and ability to serve as role models for their children.  To that end, we will  offer an ENL class for ELL parents.  Childcare will be provided (at no cost to the project) since  this has proven to optimize parent participation.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  ELA- For all grades and students: TCRWP running records based on the National Standards and Fountas and Pinnel.  For  bilingual students: STARS (Strategies To Achieve Reading Success), Spanish DRA kits and the ELE.  For grades 3 – 5: ELA pre and  post assessment ELA assessment task, baseline, midline and end line writing samples based on the TC writing continuum, New  York State ELA Assessment.  For grade 2: RAI (Reading for Application and Instruction).  Mathematics – For all grades: Unit and  End Term Assessments, Performance Based Tasks.  For grades 3 – 5: NYS Assessment in mathematics.  For grade 4 – NYS  Science  test.  Curriculum-Based Assessments (CBA) for all grades - Assessment of individual student's skills and needs using classroom  curriculum materials.      Curriculum-Based Measures (CBM) for all grades  - Standardized, brief, timed assessments in reading, math and written  expression that measure a student's status compared to peers and over time.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66        Insights and Instructional Plans – The CCLS articulate rigorous grade-level expectations focused on higher order thinking  processes in the areas of speaking, listening, reading, and writing.  We have planned professional development opportunities  and formed teacher teams that help educators:    - set up literacy-rich environments that immerse ELLs in a variety of language experiences     -  plan instruction that develops foundational skills in English so that ELLs can participate fully in grade-level work    - plan learning experiences that are comprehensible for students    - plan opportunities for classroom discourse and interaction that fosters communicative strengths;  experiences that integrate language and content objectives.                   plan learning   2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teachers administer TC running records quarterly and submit results on STARS.  All assessments are documented after  administration and taken into account for scores on STARS.  Administration is kept aware of ELL student progress and  concerns.    State assessments are carefully administered following NYC DOE protocol.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of our ELL programs is evaluated through student performance as reflected in:  program end products, the school  progress report, Acuity, post running records (TCRWP), midline and end line writing samples, progression along the writing  continuum, performance based tasks, MOSL, CBAs, CBMs and the following standardized tests:  NYSESLAT, NYS ELA test, NYS  Mathematics test, RAI, MAI,  NYS PET and the ELE .   Data is also analyzed using the EDAT tool.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Following the collection of summative data, the effectiveness of all intervention programs are assessed.  Administration makes  necessary changes to programming of ENL teachers, co-teaching models used through the grades, and RTI and AIS assignments  and strategies.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    - The school uses data-based universal screenings such as the CBM (Curriculum-Based Measures) to identify students in need  of various tiers of service delivery (assessments, problem solving procedures and interventions, pre and post MOSL).   - CBAs (Curriculum-Based Assessments) determine what the ELL knows and needs to be taught in order to guide instruction.  - Evidence-based interventions are matched to students’ needs.  Based on student challenges, services are allocated in a timely  fashion.  -  Set reasonable but rigorous goals and monitor progress frequently with high quality, feasible assessments such as CBBMs.  -  Data is used to determine when interventions are effective and to drive the adjustments needed.  -  We communicate progress to parents at predictable intervals as well as whenever necessary after instructional units or  learning blocks.  -  We refrain from leaping to a formal referral for disability screening until all ELL issues have been ruled out.                     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Data is collected from NYSESLAT, ELA state exam, Math state exam, and Science state exam and analyzed to determine areas  of greatest need.  ENL teachers revise scheduling and grouping based on those needs.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67         Data is collected from NYSESLAT testing and analyzed using the EDAT tool.  ENL teachers adjust their instruction and areas of  focus based on the findings for each student they service. ENL programming for the new school year will be setup with  students grouped into their area of greatest need (speaking, listening, reading or writing) also taken into consideration.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.           Our organizational models include push-in and pullout services in grades K-5.  The instructional groups within the  models are formed based on language proficiency as well as flexible grouping based on need.  The instructional  strategies include but are not limited to: content based English language learning, integrated  & applied learning  connecting the four strands of language acquisition (listening, speaking, reading and writing), bridging the disciplines,  LEA, project based learning, and differentiated instruction.  The program provides all language arts and subject matter  instruction in English through the use of specific instructional strategies.  Support in the home language is made  available through bilingual instructors and dual language books.  Freestanding ENL instruction is coordinated and  developed through ongoing articulation with classroom teachers and teacher teams by interest and grade.  ENL  methodologies are infused across the disciplines.  Instructional materials that under gird academic language  development have been purchased and are part of the repertoire of the providers.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.            Our TBE classes in grades K - 5 are heterogeneous and transitional.  The instructional groups within the model are  formed based on language proficiency, student interest, and flexible grouping based on need.  The instructional  strategies include but are not limited to: content based English language learning, integrated  & applied learning  connecting the four strands of language acquisition (listening, speaking, reading and writing), bridging the disciplines,  LEA, project based learning, differentiated instruction and field trips.  The TBE (Transitional Bilingual Education)  program includes language arts and subject matter instruction in the students' home language and English as well as  intensive instruction in English as a new language.  As the student develops English proficiency using the strengthened  knowledge and academic skills acquired in the home language, instruction in English increases and home language  instruction decreases.  ENL methodologies are infused across the disciplines.  Instructional materials that under gird  academic language development in English and Spanish have been purchased and placed in every TBE  classroom.  Native language arts are part of the instructional program.  However, ENL is also taught through the  disciplines of social studies, science, and mathematics so as to build academic language in English as specified in the  NYS CCLS.  Teacher program cards and plan books are reviewed by the grade supervisors to insure that the mandated  number of minutes of English and Native Language instruction is provided.  One Spanish DRA kit has been placed in  each bilingual classroom.            Through integrated ENL instruction, students develop conceptual skills in their home language as they learn  English. That is, literacy skills are transferred from a student's home language to the new language.  Content areas  such as mathematics, social studies and science are taught in the home language.  However, content based ENL  supports the development of the language of academic discourse.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.        Not Applicable         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Home language arts instruction and ENL is provided by duly licensed bilingual teachers in the bilingual classrooms  through quality based literature, trade books and textbooks.  ELA and ENL are also taught through the disciplines of social  studies, science, and mathematics so as to make advances in the students’ academic language acquisition as well as facilitate  the transition of students to   monolingual classes.  Teacher online program cards and plan books are reviewed by the grade supervisors to insure that the  mandated number of minutes of English and Home Language instruction is provided.  ELLs in the stand alone program receive  services within their classrooms for Proficiency Level “A” (Transitioning).  Students at a Beginners (Entering) and Intermediate  (Emerging) performance level on the NYSESLAT receive one period of ENL instruction within their classrooms and are pulled  out for their second period of integrated ENL instruction in a focused and intense format that aligns with classroom  instruction.  Beginning (Entering) and Intermediate (Emerging) students receive 360 minutes of instruction in English as a New  Language per week.  Students on the Advanced (Transitioning) and Expanding performance levels on the NYSESLAT receive  180 minutes per week of ENL instruction in the format described above.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In the bilingual classrooms students are held to all state standards for all disciplines.  ELA and ENL are also taught through the  disciplines of social studies, science, and mathematics so as to make advances in academic language acquisition as well as  facilitate the transition of students to monolingual classes.  Freestanding ENL instruction is coordinated and developed  through ongoing articulation with classroom teachers so as to maximize alignment of goals and objectives.  The instructional  strategies for all models include but are not limited to: content based English language learning, integrated  & applied learning  connecting the four strands of language acquisition (listening, speaking, reading and writing), bridging the disciplines, LEA,  project based learning, differentiated instruction, scaffolding, bilingual and dual language classroom libraries and reference  resources, picture books, low readability/high interest books across the grades, buddy reading and peer partnerships, and field  trips.  Triumph boards, laptops, document cameras and websites dedicated to English language learning are part of the  approaches and resources employed to help meet the demands.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Home language achievement is evaluated through teacher made unit tests, midline and endline writing samples,  progression  along the writing continuum, performance tasks by discipline, one-to-one reading and writing conferences with students,  CBMs and CBAs, MOSL, running records, and the ELE.  A comprehensive Spanish DRA kit has been placed in each bilingual  classroom for pre and post program evaluation.                5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE:   - Revisit basic concepts and skills such as recalling facts, terms, understandings   - Focus on directional words and prepositions embedded in written and verbal directions   - Foster opportunities to summarize directions   - Regularly scheduled practice in reducing verbal directions to steps   - Weekly practice in note taking after the oral reading of a nonfiction as well as fictional selection   - Setting objectives and providing feedback that narrow the focus for students and assist students in self monitoring   - Small group assignment   - Flexible and fluid grouping based on need   - AIS   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69       - Extended day participation   - Participation in Saturday academies and summer school.     b. NEWCOMERS:   - Use of visual stimuli that maximize comprehension and prompt and guide oral participation   - Integrated and varied opportunities for nonlinguistic representations   - creating graphic representations   - making physical models   - generating mental pictures   - drawing pictures and pictographs   - engaging in kinesthetic activities   - Opportunities for oral participation to explain and justify their nonlinguistic representations: panel discussions, debate  teams, individual reporting   - Small group assignment   - Flexible and fluid grouping based on need   - AIS   - Extended day participation   - Participation in Saturday academies and summer school   - Practice tests and simulations are part of all the support programs for ELLs as well as part of the classroom curricula of the  ELL homerooms.  Practice tests are downloaded in Spanish and used for students in the bilingual programs.       c. ELLS Served for 4-6 years:   - Use of cues, questions and advance organizers to enhance students’ ability to retrieve, use, and organize what they already  know about a topic   - Focus on the information that is critical to students’ understanding of the topic at hand, rather than on what is unusual or  interesting about the topic   - Higher-level questions that require analytic thinking and produce deeper learning rather than lower-level questions that  simply require students to recall or recognize information   - Guide learning using questions before a learning experience to help students develop a framework for processing  information   - Small group assignment   - Flexible and fluid grouping based on need   - AIS   - Extended day participation   - Participation in Saturday academies and summer school   - practice tests and simulations.      d. Long-Term ELLs:  - We know that long term ELLs are characterized by higher performance levels in the Listening/Speaking modalities.  These  students have a near-native level of speech and oral comprehension.  These students are challenged with higher order oral  questions and activities to apply conceptual knowledge and assigned tasks that make demands on their conversational abilities  and are intellectually demanding.  Because these students have developed a conversational ability, they may sound fluent.  However, their daily schoolwork and exams may not reflect this level of fluency.  Goals for this category of students include  developing their academic language to grade level and age expectancies and using their strengths in the Listening/Speaking  modalities as the conduits toward improved academic discourse and interpretation.  Opportunities are provided for the  students to demonstrate and stretch their understandings through panel discussions, debates, oral presentations.       e. Former ELLs:   - Access prior knowledge and build background   - Anticipatory sets that engage the learner   - Explicit content objectives that enhance academic language   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70       - Higher order questioning   - Cooperative group work within heterogeneous groupings that include native speakers of English   - Scaffolded learning   - Guided practice            6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?        Setting learning objectives for these students helps focus the direction for learning and is particularly important.  The sense  of being overwhelmed by trying to learn a new language AND content knowledge can be assuaged when students are told  exactly what they are going to learn and the intended outcomes.  Specific content objectives and language objectives are set  to establish a target.  These are aligned and/or prompted by the students’ individualized educational plans (IEPs).  There are  goals and objectives set for each curricular discipline as well, i.e., social studies, science, mathematics, etc.  Every effort is  made to add non-linguistic strategies and techniques to the pedagogy of these students.  There is extensive use of visuals,  manipulatives, miniature objects, graphic organizers, attribute charts, tables, pictographs, body movement and pantomime,  high frequency vocabulary, reduction of idiomatic expressions and personalized language.  Opportunities are made available  so that students may demonstrate learning through non linguistic representations and mediums such as dioramas,  illustrations, use of visual stimuli to prompt and guide oral participation, integrated and varied opportunities for oral  presentations: panel discussions, debate teams, individual reporting, and group development of templates to guide and  facilitate oral presentations.  Integrated and purposeful use of technology is well received and a less restrictive means to  deliver as well as evaluate instruction for this subgroup.          7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Curricular Flexibility - Streamline content by identifying essential vocabulary, content understandings, and  expectations.  Intermittently revisit these throughout the unit of instruction to anchor the "basics" of the unit;  Preview lesson  vocabulary and content; "Stack" the learning environment with visual stimuli that cue the memory of unit vocabulary and  content.  Instructional Flexibility - Adjust questions to student's ability level, i.e., match the level of complexity or abstractness to fit the  child; Pair students with higher achieving classmates; Engage students in discussion before addressing a task in order to draw  out and practice the vocabulary needed to accomplish the task; Link new concepts to the new content to be learned;  Flexible  learning groups that form and/or dissolve based on student interests, needs, and abilities.   Scheduling flexibility - Break larger teaching/learning tasks into a number of smaller more manageable tasks, separated by  short breaks in instruction; Intersperse less demanding task with more demanding tasks; Support students with their time  management through wall clocks, timers, verbal reminders, peer time keepers, etc.  ELL- SWDs are placed in ICT classes based on the recommendations for special education programs and services as reflected on  the Individualized Educational Program (IEP).     The data used to identify those ELLs in need of intervention are the NYS Reading and Writing Benchmarks, MoSL, End-of-unit  benchmarks & assessments, NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, TCRWP Running Records, Teacher-made interim assessments, Baseline,  Midline, Endline Writing Assessments, NYS ELA, NYS MATH, NYSAA., IEPs, and Feedback from RtI providers (all tiers).       Targeted interventions for:  English Language Learners –   - Accelerated oral language development that includes BICS, CALP, CALLA   - content based (Socials Studies, Math, Science) ENL instruction that promotes the learning of the language of academic  discourse   - integration of heritage cultures and languages wherever possible   - integrated and seamless instruction supported through best practices techniques such as visual aids and differentiated  instruction that highlights connections among the academic disciplines   - narrowing the achievement gap through supplementary remediation and enrichment programs   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71       - differentiated, content based intervention (AIS, RtI) in home language of the bilingual classrooms, and parent engagement    ELLs SWD–   - Individually planned teaching procedures that support students in accessing the curricula including but not limited to  adapted content   - modified environment   - specialized providers (OT/PT, Speech, Hearing)   - specialized equipment   - adjusted timelines   - customized end products   - alternate assessments   - parent engagement    RtI and AIS students –   - Early identification of learning needs   - interventions at increasing levels of intensity to accelerate their rate of learning   - close monitoring of performance levels   - instruction that is modified and integrated with classroom instruction and data driven   - parent engagement    STH –  - Immediate enrollment of students   - differentiated academic performance assessments   - equal access to all school programs and services   - family assistance   - parent engagement    ALL ELLs –   - Continuous replenishment of Dual Language and Spanish books in the classroom libraries.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  SWDs whose IEP recommends ENL or bilingual instruction -   - AIS, small group instruction,  thematic instruction based on student needs and weaknesses, small group assignment based on  periodic informal and formal assessments, flexible and fluid grouping, participation in extended day program, participation in  before school and Saturday programs using content based ENL, articulation between SETSS and AIS providers to establish short  and long term objectives based on goals set forth on IEPs.    ELL Newcomers - AIS, small group instruction,  small group assignment based on stage of oral language development [one  word utterances, simple sentences, extended discourse], flexible and fluid grouping, participation in extended day program,  articulation between classroom teachers, AIS providers and extended day providers to establish short and long term  objectives, participation in before school and Saturday programs,  use of visual stimuli to prompt and guide oral participation,  integrated and varied opportunities for oral participation, group development of templates to guide and facilitate oral  presentations.    ELLs served 4 – 6 years - AIS, small group instruction, small group assignment based on reading levels and skills, participation in  extended day program, articulation between classroom teachers, AIS providers and extended day providers to establish short  and long term objectives, participation in before school and Saturday programs, pervasive use of graphic organizers to support  comprehension, guided practice in using context clues to determine meaning, teacher made recordings of content based   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72      material, preview of content based concepts through trade books and classroom library, expand background knowledge with a  variety of learning experiences at school and through field trips, systematic and routine paraphrasing opportunities for small  groups and individual students, extensive use of highlighters to distinguish the main idea from the supporting details of a  selection, consistently follow concrete experiences with written directions, prominently display new vocabulary and promote  its use in different and varied contexts.

RtI for ELLs: Universal screening - Benchmark assessments such as CBAs and teacher-made diagnostics are administered to  prioritize students needing interventions.  1) Tier I addresses the core instructional program, working from the simple to the  complex, communicating with common vocabulary and basic phrases.  As students’ comprehension increases, word and  sentence complexity is increased.  Other strategies used: Discuss support strategies with peers.  Teach peers how to provide  appropriate and effective supports.  Show, model, use abbreviated directions and visuals, monitor understanding through  narrowly spaced check points.  Provide immediate feedback.  2) Tier II targets students needing additional help.  These  students are supported through activities such as: *Listening Passage Preview, * Paired and Choral Reading, * Drill and  Practice, * Repeated Readings.  3) Tier III is for those requiring intensive intervention.  These students are also supported  through the sample activities already identified for Tier II.              For all tiers: Differentiated Instruction - adapt curriculum content, delivery of instruction and student end products to  match students' ability levels, strengths and interest.  For all ELL groups - Saturday Academies in Reading, Math and Science, Early Morning Programs in the four strands of language  acquisition, and after school enrichment programs that are project based for grades 1 & 2.       The data used to identify those ELLs in need of intervention are: • NYS Reading and Writing Benchmarks, • MoSL, • End-of-unit  benchmarks & assessments, • NYSITELL, • NYSESLAT, • TCRWP Running Records, • Teacher-made interim assessments, •  Baseline, Midline, Endline Writing Assessments, • NYS ELA, • NYS MATH, • NYS ESPET, • NYSAA, • IEPs, • Feedback from RtI  providers (all tiers).       Additional Targeted interventions for:  English Language Learners – •Accelerated oral language development that includes BICS, CALP, CALLA, •content based (Socials  Studies, Math, Science) ENL instruction that promotes the learning of the language of academic discourse, •integration of  heritage cultures and languages wherever possible, •integrated and seamless instruction supported through best practices  techniques such as visual aids and differentiated instruction that highlights connections among the academic disciplines,  •narrowing the achievement gap through supplementary remediation and enrichment programs, •differentiated, content  based intervention (AIS, RtI) in home language of the bilingual classrooms, and parent engagement  ELLs SWD– •Individually planned teaching procedures that support students in accessing the curricula including but not limited  to adapted content, •modified environment, •specialized providers (OT/PT, Speech, Hearing), •specialized equipment,  •adjusted timelines, •customized end products, •alternate assessments, and •parent engagement.  RtI and AIS students – •Early identification of learning needs, •interventions at increasing levels of intensity to accelerate their  rate of learning, •close monitoring of performance levels, •instruction that is modified and integrated with classroom  instruction and data driven, and •parent engagement.  STH – •Immediate enrollment of students, •differentiated academic performance assessments, •equal access to all school  programs and services, •family assistance, •parent engagement.  ALL ELLs – Continuous replenishment of Dual Language and Spanish books in the classroom libraries.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      New Programs -   - In grades 3-5, the uninterrupted block scheduling for ELA instruction will continue; School wide performance based tasks for  mathematics   - AM ELA/Math  enrichment sessions for level 1 ELLs – 50 sessions   - AM ELA enrichment sessions for newcomer parents and students - 15 sesssions   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73       - Replenishment of “Reading Trends” Curriculum Associates for Tier I intervention   - AM ELA & Math sessions for ELL students that receive special educaiton services   - Replenishment of the “I ready”  – computer program for ELA that provides immediate feedback to students.    Improvements -   - Continue the ELA and Math morning enrichment programs for ELLs in grades 1 - 5 with a sustained alignment to the CCLS   - Continue the morning programs for ELLs in grades 1-5 with a sustained alignment to the CCLS.    - Continue Saturday Academies in ELA, Math and Science for ELLs in grades 3-5 with a sustained alignement to the CCLS   - Continue Parent Outreach programs through ENL & GED classes, Family Nights, Thematic Workshops in the Home Language  or translated   - Improvements in the Envision Math program were made by the Pearson company that are accessible to teachers on line and  that were integrated for the 2017-18 school year.    - Based on the requirements of the CCLS and the demands of the Teacher Effectiveness Framework, new curriculum units are  being developed that combine content area skills and understandings with English Language Arts instruction   - The Botanical Garden will be expanded to include cluster teachers who serve ELLs   - The school wide schedule has been adjusted to include more PD sessions on a cyclical rotating basis.   -  Each grade receives an additional period of PD on their designated week.  Teachers meet with their supervisors to further  examine the nuances of the Danielson framework.  Teacher Teams design curricula that is timely, aligned with the CCLS,  includes Rubrics evaluations and are based on student needs and interests.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   All programs and services will be continued for the 2018-2019 school year.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  A minimum of 40 % of the seats in any and all of our school programs are reserved for ELLs.  Our ELL students participate in the  following school programs:    - AIS   - small group instruction   - thematic instruction   - flexible and fluid grouping   - before school programs   - Saturday programs   - summer school   - guided reading groups   - at risk SETSS   - library access   - computer laboratory access   - science laboratories   - visual arts program   - math enrichment   - RtI   - the physical education program.           12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional Materials Used to Support ELLs – Home as well as English language textbooks and student workbooks, bilingual  classroom libraries, dual language books, bilingual glossaries and dictionaries, home language DVDs and CDs for content  instruction, home language books on tape, translated practice tests in mathematics, science and social studies, content based  Big Books from the Newbridge collection, Rosen libraries, and www.ColorinColorado.org – This free website offers strategies  for student placement and assessment, best instructional practices, cutting-edge professional development webcasts; and a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74      toolkit on effective outreach to Hispanic parents.  The following technology is used to enhance the language development of  ELLs: computer lab, smart boards, lap tops, DVD players, CD players, elmos and projectors.  Content area materials also  include: Science - FOSS kits, Mathematics - "Envision Math," and supplemental resources for social studies and science in the  format of content area read alouds, Big Books and small group sets.  Themes are planned, developed and executed based on  the CCLS and the work of the Teacher Teams.             13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home Language Support – TBE: Teachers alternate the language of the Reading/Writing workshop from day to day to insure  literacy and language development of the two languages.  Home language arts are also taught through the content  areas.  Classroom libraries are supplied with home language books in all genres and readability levels.  Classrooms are supplied  with home language Big Books across the disciplines and in all grades.  Our Scholastic book fair features books in the home  languages as well as in English.  Our Family Nights provide take-home materials in the home languages.  Test translations are  used.  ENL: There is extensive use of the bilingual mode method.  That is, questions/tasks are put to the student in English,  responses/end products are accepted in the home language.  Dual language books, bilingual dictionaries, and home language  glossaries are available.  Content based ENL instruction is provided.  Bilingual alternate placement paraprofessionals have been  added.  Bilingual peer helpers are used.              14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Service providers tailor, modify, and customize instruction based on what they know about their students.  Providers plan  lessons and design classroom learning environments that are responsive to the full range of student needs based on grade and  curricular expectations vis a vis the CCLS.  All ELL students have access to targeted, rigorous instruction which includes  additional support where needed, in order to meet state standards.  Resources are purchased and/or updated to reflect  student interests based on age, curricular demands based on grade, and technological advancements.                 15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Instructional Materials Used to Support ELLs – Home as well as English language textbooks and student workbooks, bilingual  classroom libraries, dual language books, bilingual glossaries and dictionaries, home language DVDs and CDs for content  instruction, home language books on tape, translated practice tests in mathematics, science and social studies, content based  Big Books from the Newbridge collection, Rosen libraries, and www.ColorinColorado.org – This free website offers strategies  for student placement and assessment, best instructional practices, cutting-edge professional development webcasts; and a  toolkit on effective outreach to Hispanic parents.  The following technology is used to enhance the language development of  ELLs: computer lab, smart boards, lap tops, DVD players, CD players, elmos and projectors.  Content area materials also  include: Science - FOSS kits, Mathematics - "Envision Math," and supplemental resources for social studies and science in the  format of content area read alouds, Big Books and small group sets.  Themes are planned, developed and executed based on  the CCLS and the work of the Teacher Teams.             16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   These students and their parents are invited to participate in: summer school for grades 3-5, parent orientation in the summer  for Kindergarten parents hosted by the Principal and grade supervisor, fall parent orientations for grades 1 -5 facilitated by the  classroom teachers, walk-throughs for all grades on grade-specific days, guided school tours on parent conference days,  parent/student activities such as writing celebrations within classrooms, and monthly family nights based on themes, needs  and interests.  Throughout the year, our Bilingual Guidance Counselor and the Parent Coordinator offer thematic workshops  that address but are not limited to: the nature of instruction for ELLs, navigating the local, district and DOE protocols,  parenting concerns, the home-school connection, and supporting the curricular demands of the CCLS.  Every effort is made to  maximize their participation in all offerings through advertisement flyers, person to person outreach, electronic  communications, backpack letters, and telephone contacts.             17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Not Applicable      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75            18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not Applicable        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The school’s math coach is a former bilingual teacher who works closely with bilingual staff, making available all materials,  resources and supports and models lessons in the home language.  The emphasis of these model lessons is on the alignment of  the CCLS with the differentiated needs of the ELL students.  ENL teachers share best practices with all teachers in planned and  focused articulation meetings as well as in informal peer to peer meetings based on need and interest.  Push in opportunities  are used to model best practices when necessary.  ENL and bilingual teachers are integral members of the Teacher Teams.      PD opportunities are as follows:  *In-House Monday Professional Development sessions  *Bronx Borough Field Support Center PD opportunities (offered on-site and at the support center)  *Center for Integrated Teacher Education (CITE) consultant offerings on -site    The topics of these opportunities and/or series include but are not limited to: Teaching Reading to ELLs, Ways to Use Non- Fiction to Develop Oral Language and Support Informational Reading, Secrets that Primary Teachers Know, ELLs and Common  Core Academic Standards: Successful Strategies for the Content Classroom, A Systematic Approach to Leveling the Playing Field  for ELLs, Academic success for English learners, Removing Barriers to Learning for Long-Term English Learners, Using EDAT to  Support ELLs, and Looking Deeper at Language Arts Progressions for Differentiation and Scaffolding.  One of our extended days (Mondays) is used for professional development.  On this day ENL teachers meet to discuss the CCLS  and the Danielson Teacher Effectiveness Framework vis-à-vis the manifest needs of ELLs.  Through Title III funding, grade band  workshops are offered on a rotating basis on ELL lesson designs that integrate language objectives with content objectives, so  as to make advances on these two fronts at once, as per the priorities outlined in the CCLS.  Through autonomous funding, PD  sessions are offered in: * aligning the CCSS with the needs of ELLs, *RtI and ELLS.  Bilingual and ENL teachers are dispersed  throughout the Professional Activity groups so as to address the implications of instructional practice on ELLs.  Teacher Teams  generally include a bilingual classroom teacher and/or an ENL teacher.  These teams plan and disseminate intervention lessons  that differentiate instruction for the English language learner.  The data that drives these interventions is taken from the  NYSESLAT, NYS ELA test, NYS mathematics test, CBAs, CMAs, Acuity, Performance Based Tasks, MOSLs, and teacher  observations.  Bilingual and ENL teachers participate in the professional development offered through the TCRWP.  We also  avail ourselves of the opportunities offered by the district and Bronx Borough Field Support Team, depending on the themes or  topics offered.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Fifth grade teachers meet with their grade supervisor to discuss middle schools that offer programs for ELLs.  The school’s  guidance counselor meets with the fifth grade teachers to examine the characteristics and opportunities offered for ELLs in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76         particular middle schools.  Middle school representatives hold meetings at our school to provide orientations to their  programs and printed materials to the students and parents.  Students are taken on school tours of the prospective middle  schools.  The fifth grade Guidance Counselor serves as liaison between parents and the prospective school to set up individual  guided tours.   The guidance counselor for the fifth grade participates in all in house PD for the fifth grade.  They attended middle school open  houses and receive additional orientation and development from the middle school representatives.  They then turnkey the  information to fifth grade teachers and the grade supervisor.           Two venues are used: 1) our regularly scheduled Professional Development days (Mondays) include cyclical series that address  the needs of ELLs across the curriculum.  These are facilitated by the ELL specialists or are outsourced.  2) Both bilingual and  ENL teachers participate in opportunities offered by the Bronx Borough Field Support Center with particular interest in content  based ENL and the development of academic language.  These teachers turnkey the content of the workshops/training as  assigned by school leadership and based on staff needs and interests.  Attendance sheets are maintained in the ELL document  repository in the main office.  Teachers who have transcript evidence of college courses on the subject of English language  development for speakers of other languages are credited with the corresponding PD hours.                Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   These contacts are made on Tuesdays after student dismissal and by appointment in response to parent requests.  They can  take place in person, via phone conference, e-mail and/or backpack letters.  The school has bilingual staff available in all of the  high incidence languages of the school for oral and/or written translations.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  In the fall we hold translated Parent Orientation meetings by grade.  These allow parents to formally meet their child's teacher  and become acquainted with the curricula and materials of the child's new grade.  Monthly calendars are sent to every home  to maintain parents informed of special events such as assembly programs, trips, parent workshops and changes in the daily  schedule.  A digital lobby monitor informs and celebrates successes displaying photographs as well as pertinent information of  upcoming events.  As a component of the Mosholu Montefiore Health Clinic housed in our school, parents attend translated  thematic workshops and participate in Saturday field trips with their children throughout NYC.  During the work week, the  Parent Coordinator plans, executes and translates thematic workshops based on parent interests and needs expressed.       Parent meetings are called by the administrative team to discuss topics such as the school report card, assessment data,  promotional criteria and IEPs for the parents affected, changes in NYSED/DOE policy such as CCLS and changes to standardized  assessment instruments such as the NYSITELL.                We have an active and involved Parent Association Executive Board that meets monthly with the building principal to  discuss current topics and plan general membership meetings.       We offer Saturday parent/child workshops, and weekly GED, citizenship, and ENL classes driven by funding and interest.     We offer monthly family nights on a variety of topics of interest to the parents.  Parents are invited to our writing  celebrations, assembly programs and field trips.     The Mosholu Montefiore Community Programs and the Beacon Program offer after school recreational programs for our  students.  These include a parent component that offers evening ENL, exercise and crafts classes.  All meetings and parent  activities include interpretation services for LEP parents.               Written school information is translated into the four high incidence languages in our school population.              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Claudia Tahiraj, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S.

Yes/No    Michelle   Capo   Parent Coordinator   Yes   Yes          * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      At the beginning of each school year, emergency contact cards (blue cards) are distributed to parents during  freshman orientation and through advisors for all grades. Advisors support school administrative staff with  collection of the forms. Language preferences for parents are updated in ATS based on the emergency contact  cards. For new students, we also utilize the Home Language Identification Survey to determine parents' and  guardians' preferred languages. We monitor preferences and responses from parents from the Annual Learning  Environment Survey to determine parents' preferred methods of communication. We maintain this information in  ATS, and advisors and grade teams maintain parent contact logs that include information about translation and  interpretation needs. We arrange for Parent-Teacher Conferences by appointment and utilize a spreadsheet to  schedule interpreters to support parents. Our community associate and bilingual guidance counselor translate  written documents for mailings, and we utilize an automated phone message system that offers translation to  many languages. This system initiates phone calls in parents' preferred language (as indicated in ATS). We run the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81      RPOB report in ATS for disaggregated information of home languages by grade, class and individual students. We  also use the aggregated Home Language report in ATS to capture the high incidence languages of the school.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.
