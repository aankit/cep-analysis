This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At P721R, The Richard H. Hungerford School, our Mission is:   Section 4: CEP Overview      P721R provides quality and rigorous individualized educational programs to students with significant challenges and  diverse learning styles in a variety of settings that nurture independence, ensure dignity, and support integration into  the community.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Contextual Information:    P721R is a District 75 Middle and High School that serves a variety student populations including: 12:1+4, 6:1+1,  8:1+1, 12:+1 and inclusion in both the Middle and High School settings. In addition to the Main Site, P721R hosts 8 off- sites including, IS 24, the Jerome Parker Campus, LifeStyles, McKee HS, New Dorp HS, Tottenville HS, Project Search at  Staten Island University Hospital, and Community Resources. Each site is designed to enhance the needs of the unique  population of students that attend that site. Our school educates 474 students from grades 6 through 12. The school  population is comprised of African American: 21%, Hispanic: 30%, Caucasian: 43%, Asian: 5%, and 1% Pacific  Islander/Native American.       During September 2017, P721R’s newly appointed Principal, Kristin McHugh, a former Assistant Principal within our  own school community, offered hope and promise to implement the Hungerford vision and mission, and to positively  enhance school culture, impacting student achievement. Throughout the 2017-2018 school year, Principal McHugh  provided staff, students, and parents with consistency and fidelity in maintaining the vision of Hungerford while also  introducing and implementing a rigorous action plan in order to enhance the quality of work we do to allow our  students to meet their maximum potential.       Under our current leadership of Principal McHugh, P721R has adopted a theory of action aligned to the implemented  plan to address several needs areas identified in the PPO. Our theory of action is grounded in the work of teachers  and professional learning communities in collecting and analyzing student achievement data in order to provide  students with access to rigorous curriculum that meets their individualized learning needs.       P721R advocates for policies of distributive leadership and builds capacity within the school by empowering our  educators to lead projects, take ownership and progress in their professional career. There have been several  paraprofessionals and teaching staff that have moved up both within and outside of our organization into leadership  positions.      At P721R, students are exposed to a variety of community based learning sites which are based on student interest  such as custodial, carpentry, food service, office, gardening, recreational, stocking inventory, customer service and  retail experiences. These sites focus on work readiness, skill acquisition and employability. Community based learning  programs are a valuable component of transition and these programs integrate our students into the community,  while helping them acquire and generalize critical skills to gain and maintain a job. In addition to our community  based sites, several sites within our organization have initiated snack cart/cafe programs to provide students with  realistic work settings and experiences within the school community. Our Community base partnerships are as  follows: Stapes, The Brielle Assisted Living Residence, Living Restoration, United Cerebral Palsy greenhouse, Wagner  College, Mc Donald's, Fort Wadsworth, Harvest Cafe, Barnes and Noble, and Five Below. Our Community Resources  off-site has on-site training in the area of Automotive, Culinary Arts, Cafe/Barista, and Graphic Design working with a  company called Special Tee's. Aside from our community partnerships, P721R has developed internship programs  which are an integral part of the transition process for our students. Being our Alternate Assessment students are  receiving a Skills and Achievement Commencement Credential certificate, these internships allow students to  interview and maintain positions post-graduation. The internship programs we currently have in place are CVS  Pharmacy and Project Search, which is a new program completing it’s first year through AHRC and Staten Island  University Hospital.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         During the 2017-18 school year, The Hungerford School and New Dorp High School continued to foster a Collaborative  School Community, which is a school culture of full inclusion, mutual respect, understanding and collaboration  between staff and students. Our students have multiple job exposure opportunities and integration with their general  education peers.      P721R consistently strives to support and empower its professional staff. The New Teacher Institute at P721R helps to  make the first year of teaching as smooth as possible with available resources and experienced volunteer mentors.  Mentors provide new teachers with strategies, tools and ongoing support to meet the challenges of their new careers.  During full-day sessions multiple times throughout the school year, participants learn about classroom management,  instructional techniques, assessment administration, inclusion, best practice for communicating with students,  parents and colleagues, technology tools and the school community at P721R. We had 9 teachers in the 2017-2018  complete the program.    Goals for the 2018-2019 New Teacher Institute include:    1. Collaboration to develop a personal toolbox of applicable techniques for planning and delivering effective  instruction.    2. Maximizing time and energy for managing a demanding classroom schedule and school culture.    3. Acquiring technology tools that enable teachers, mentors and their students to organize and retrieve classroom  data and information around planning, prioritizing, assessment and communication.    4. Learning and practicing leadership coaching tools that benefit personal, student, colleague, and parent  communication.    5. Creating a supportive, sustaining coaching beginning teacher/mentor relationship.       P721R also incorporates technology as a valuable resource using iPads, a Bluetooth switch and mounting systems to  allow student to take photographs and participate in the photo class. With the money received from the 2017-18  RESO A grant. This year we were able to utilize our resources to purchase a variety of technology to meet the  individualized needs of our sites and support our students growth.

Many students require specific instruction in awareness of the environment, pedestrian skills, problem solving,  transportation/ travel-related skills and behaviors to achieve independent mobility and use of public transit. P721R's  Travel Training personnel are specifically trained in the Competencies for the Practice of Travel Instruction and Travel  Training to provide this individualized instruction to eligible students. Travel Training is a comprehensive, specially  designed, one-to-one instruction program to teach high school age students how to travel safely and independently  on public transportation. Independent travel and use of public transit is closely connected to successful post-school  results for students in terms of employment, education, community inclusion, and independent living.       P721R utilizes the Student Annual Needs Determination Inventory (SANDI), a comprehensive classroom assessment  for students with significant intellectual impairments. The SANDI allows access to Common Core Learning Standards  (CCLS), in order to specifically target individual student strengths and needs. The SANDI provides a basis to determine  educational benefits related to the student’s present levels of performance, progress on the Individual Education  Program (IEP) goals and identification of educational needs. All tasks are aligned to CCLS and provide our students  with an entry point to these standards in a way that is meaningful and functional for their individual needs. Although  P721R administers a formal SANDI Assessment twice per year (Fall and Spring), teachers utilize the SANDI throughout  the year as a tool to note mastery and need areas that are flagged to address goals.       Formative Assessment of Standards Tasks (FAST) is an extension of the SANDI which is used as a benchmark  assessment. The FAST utilizes multiple measures of data collection which is composed of an electronic portfolio that  tracks students progress across time. The FAST collects targeted standard reports by student, teacher, site and  district. The data is used to guide instruction using evidence-based practices.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         P721R asserts that many maladaptive behaviors may occur due to a student’s inability to express their emotions.  Every classroom in P721R has adopted a mood meter to assist students in their self-expression as well as reflection.  Emotions are continuously discussed in an open forum in every classroom. It is P721R's belief that a student cannot  learn unless they are self-regulated. The incorporation of emotional literacy and the mood meter have reduced  maladaptive behavior within our school environment and create an atmosphere that fosters learning and student  progress.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Elements of the Framework for Great Schools Demonstrating Progress for the 2017-2018 School Year:        Based on the 2018-19 School Quality Guide, P721R made significant and notable progress in the areas of Effective  School Leadership and Trust as evidenced by a 12% increase from the District level data in the area of Principal to  teacher trust. This data is a testament to the mission and vision of our new school leader, Kristin McHugh. We have  worked this year towards building capacity and empowering teacher teams to take more leadership roles within the  school, including inquiry teams with targeted areas, providing them with autonomy and flexibility.       We have worked to embed the arts within core curriculum areas to enhance the areas of both Supportive  Environment and Strong Family and Community Ties. To support the area of Supportive Environment we have created  a cluster position for teaching literacy through drama. Our drama cluster teacher provides a class that teaches our  students literacy skills needed to support the school's collaborative spring musical.       P721R has been in a successful partnership with Lincoln Center Education over the past 5 years. During the 2017-18  school year, The Jerome Parker Campus, was showcased as a Lincoln Center Focus school. During this partnership,  lead teachers created and implemented an action research project, highlighting the progression of our students  through the arts with a specialized focus on how they can increase their capacity for reflection, gain a sense of  independence through choice-making, and develop meaningful interactions with peers. Our school is in the fourth  year of a Grant, in association with MTI and Broadway Junior. In accordance with the Framework for Great Schools  areas of collaborative teachers and supportive environment, this grant allowed us to put on a school-wide production  of a musical. This past year we live streamed Lion King JR. across our school sites and our students got a chance to  perform the show for their peers, parents and staff. Theatrical arts enhance and enrich our students program, while  providing them with a sense of belonging and purpose.       Continuing to highlight the area of Supportive Environment, P721R has strived to attain the Least Restrictive  Environment for every student and to show reductions and terminations with related service providers. The data for  the 2017-2018 school year is as follows:    Class Ratio : Total 22    1 -D75 Alternate Assessment to D31 Standardized,    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      7- 12:1:1 to SETSS Inclusion,    6- 12:1:3:1 to 12:1:1,    2 6:1:1 to SETSS-Inclusion,    5-6:1:1 to 12:1:1 ,    3- 8:1:1 to 12:1:1    Terminations: Total 63   12- 1:1 Paraprofessional’s    17- Speech Therapy    18- Occupational Therapy,    3- Physical Therapy,    18- Counseling,    1- Hearing,    Reductions: Total 103    37- Speech Therapy,    47 -Occupational Therapy,    23 Physical Therapy,    10- Counseling    4- Vision       These statistics are a testament of the ability of P721R to work towards enabling students to gain greater  independence in their least restrictive environment.       Since an area of need was monitoring and revising systems, the administrative team has worked hard to develop a  comprehensive action plan to address the below areas of focus (needs) indicated by the PPO completed in April 2018  in order to improve the overall school.       Elements of the Framework for Great Schools Indicating Areas of Focus for the 2018-2019 School Year:    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14      According to P721R PPO (Principal Performance Observation), next steps are to "support teachers with lesson  preparation and with developing a better understanding of students cognitive levels and PLOP (present level of  performance)". Therefore, our key areas of focus from the Framework for Great Schools for the 2018 – 2019 school  year are rigorous instruction (Pedagogy and Assessment) and collaborative teachers (Teacher Support and  Supervision.) According to MOTP (measurement of teacher performance) of Advance section 3D, using assessment in  instruction, is the area where most growth is needed. Also, based on feedback from district level walk throughs,  P721R initially lacked overall vision and guidance for teacher teams and needed updated inquiry team and PLC focus  templates. We plan to deepen these areas of focus this school year.       Although P721R scored stronger than the citywide average, an area of focus within the framework will be fostering  Strong Family-Community Ties. This past school year, P721R welcomed a new parent coordinator. Sadly, our previous  parent coordinator had passed away suddenly February of 2016. As a school community, we anticipated an  adjustment period for our new parent coordinator. During the 2018-19 school year, we hired a brand new parent  coordinator and the school administration will continue to work to establish strong relationships with families and  community members by having the parent coordinator work more closely with the P721R transition office and  introduce weekend events to create more accessibility and further support for our parents and students in designated  needs areas identified on the Level One Vocational Assessments, qualitative parents feedback and IEP conferences.       To align to the areas of Rigorous Instruction, during the 2018-19 school year, P721R will continue to focus on  embedding arts in education and incorporate research-based curriculums aligned to specific student need levels in  order to improve student achievement. Purchased curriculums for this year include: Unique, Attainment, Stemscopes,  EQUALS, and First Author. Our school is also piloting a data tracking system to ensure monitoring For the 2018-2019  school year, P721R will focus on continuing best practices to support students and staff. This includes, utilizing  formative assessment tools, such as SANDI and FAST, in order to collect meaningful data for all students in order to  more accurately inform instruction. Students will continue to take ownership of what they are learning by continuing  to utilize self-assessments that effectively communicate a students voice.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 75R721   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   07,08,09,10,11,12,S E   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   476   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     To support students to develop their maximum potential by providing them with essential academic, social,  emotional, and behavioral skills. Our program accomplishes this goal by creating a nurturing environment that is  physically and emotionally receptive to the needs of our students and their families. We use a collaborative, multi- sensory approach involving age appropriate, research based, individualized instruction. We believe in shared decision  making that involves integrating the families and community of the children in our school in order to develop of  cooperative and respectful policies that directly and positively impact student achievement.   According to PPO (Principal Performance Observation) from April 2018, P721R next steps are "to help teachers use  assessments to confirm each student's appropriate entry point into instruction. This will allow them to create lessons  and student groups to support individualized levels and needs, with ongoing opportunities to practice skills using  strategies that confirm understanding and learning while supporting independence." Showing us a priority need for  our school is to utilize a school wide data collection system in order to analyze school based trends and inform  instruction to provide a more rigorous curriculum that meets students individualized levels and needs. Also,  suggested to review school wide data tracking systems in order to create one for P721R.   The school community is dedicated to supporting its students and its cohesive efforts result in a safe and productive  learning environment, harnessing the strengths of related service providers, interventions and technology. Classroom  observations that provide effective feedback and articulate clear expectations, coupled with the continuous analysis  of student work, support professional growth ensuring improved instruction.      P721R has high expectations for academic rigor. We implement the Student Annual Needs Determination Indicators  (SANDI) in all of our sites as a diagnostic/summative assessment, as well as, measurement of student learning. We  have been using this tool to help identify academic needs, which informs us of writing individualized S.M.A.R.T.  (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely) IEP goals for all of our students. The SANDI helps staff  determine student need areas and aligns those needs to content standards, providing access to grade level standards  based curriculum. The FAST is a performance based, short-cycle formative assessment, which informs instruction  immediately, monitors progress on high leverage standards and describes how students are progressing in targeted  skills that are directly aligned to the Chancellors Instructional Expectations.   Priority needs are addressed in our goals and proposed action plans in order to increase practices of rigorous  instruction for the 2018-2019 school year. The Hungerford Schools Instructional Focus will increase opportunity for  meaningful assessment indicating next steps for students across all environments, informing purposeful instruction.  As a school policy, we will advocate for challenging academic instruction and hands-on opportunities aligned to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          17      specific SANDI skills, creating streamlined and targeted instruction for each students unique needs. SANDI  assessments will also be integrated as a living document, aligning with our school marking periods and done  throughout five times during the year to ensure effective and timely monitored of targeted and flagged goals outlined  in the IEP (September, November, January, March, June and during the development of their IEP). In this way,  teachers will be able to capture and analyze data on IEP goals developed from SANDI skill areas in Reading, Writing,  Math and Communication.      Professional Learning Communities comprised of teacher teams will meet regularly to plan units of study based upon  the needs of their students, analyze student work, data progress monitor & make revisions in both complexity and  instructional strategies. Starting in the 2018-2019 school year, we will begin using Attainment Data Keeper to track  IEP goals and progress towards instructional goals.       In addition to an increased emphasis on in-house curriculum and instructional rigor, during the 2017-2018 school year  721R also had the opportunity to collaborate with people from the District Office to help our teachers facilitate  meaningful instructional practices in their classrooms. Teachers were able to meet with ELA, Math, and Autism  coaches to plan lessons and work on their classroom structure. Additionally, we reorganized our instructional track  assigning classrooms supplemental programs to use to increase student achievement such as Attainment, Unique,  First Author, Failure Free Reading, Equals, ST Math, and STEMScopes.      As an organization we continue to believe that these multiple points of assessment provide teachers with guidance  concerning the range of writing skills to be taught, the importance of exposing students to diverse text types,  strategies for generating a range of topics, and supporting teachers as they identify multiple entry points into the  content so that all students needs are met.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  In order to create the most supportive environment for our students, P721R provides students with their least  restrictive environment (LRE), and promotes independence. As students gain the necessary skills to perform activities  of daily living they are able to participate in the academic and vocational programs with more independence and  experience greater success. We emphasize safety and transition skills as our students become valued members of the  community.    P721R advocates for students to be in their Least Restrictive Environment () as outlined by the IDEA. The basis of is to  maximize potential while incorporating students in an environment that allows them the opportunity to be involved  in the greatest extent possible in an environment that is most conducive to their learning needs. During the 2016-17  school year, the class ratio LRE is as follows:    The data for the 2017-2018 school year is as follows:    Class Ratio : Total 22    1 -D75 Alternate Assessment to D31 Standardized,    7- 12:1:1 to SETSS Inclusion,    6- 12:1:3:1 to 12:1:1,    2 6:1:1 to SETSS-Inclusion,    5-6:1:1 to 12:1:1 ,    3- 8:1:1 to 12:1:1    Terminations: Total 63    12- 1:1 Paraprofessional’s    17- Speech Therapy    18- Occupational Therapy,    3- Physical Therapy,    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22      18- Counseling,    1- Hearing,    Reductions: Total 103    37- Speech Therapy,    47 -Occupational Therapy,    23 Physical Therapy,    10- Counseling    4- Vision    These statistics are a testament of the ability of P721R to work towards enabling students to gain greater  independence.     Based on the feedback from the 2017-2018 PPO, P721R will be implementing protocols and procedures to design  more rigorous instruction for our students to meet their unique needs. Based on the more targeted, meaningful and  purposeful instruction, we anticipate showing a positive trend in student achievement in terms of our LRE data for the  2018-2019 school year.

Based on evidence gathered throughout comprehensive research within our school, Professional Learning  Communities have shown to improve effective instruction and student achievement. Research has shown that school  change that improves teacher practice and student outcomes may be achieved by implementing the Professional  Learning Community and inquiry model. Key aspects of increasing student success are to include the development of  a collaborative culture, the use of high quality professional development to improve teacher practices, and strong  leadership. The ongoing development of the professional learning community model asserts the mission that a  student’s formal education is not simply to ensure that students are taught, but to ensure that they learn.       However, evidence based on our PPO conducted in the 2017-2018 school year suggests that although the teams were  meeting on a regular basis, many professional learning communities lacked overall focus and vision. In April 2018, we  implemented inquiry teams in addition to our PLC group. We structured the inquiry teams to follow a 10-week cycle  of inquiry. This simple shift, from a focus on teaching to a focus on learning, has profound implications for our school  community. The school promotes a culture of cross-curricular learning that is embedded through all interdisciplinary  areas. The focus is to intertwine multiple disciplines into one cohesive concept that can be taught by teachers in order  for students to access information to generalize skills in their tangible world.       Inquiry teams for the 2018-2019 school year will be implemented to enhance the student experiences and create  teacher teams that are intended to support and foster the learning process. The impact of this work will increase  coherence, collaboration and rigor in the curriculum, instruction and assessment; increased student achievement as a  result of improved teacher practice including alignment of instruction and assessment to the CCLS, and planning  curriculum. During inquiry group meetings, teachers will meet to evaluate a designated area of need specific to their  student population. Teachers will be provided with the autonomy to select an area of need based on the analysis of  data available to them: IEP data, SANDI, FAST, observational data. Teachers will follow a cycle of 10-week inquiry in  which they pre and post assessments to monitor their designated area of study. This data will be consistently  analyzed on weekly basis to capture the progress and further inform instructional decisions and next steps.

To improve the instructional core across our classrooms by fostering teacher development, our school community is  interested in deepening our comprehension of the framework for teaching. In 2017-18, as part of Advance, our school  leaders conduct frequent cycles of formative classroom observations and feedback, and ongoing professional  development to support improved teacher practice. We want our teachers to know what effective teaching looks like,  have a shared language to discuss what’s working and what needs to be improved, and know which actions to take to  improve their practice.       Collectively throughout our organization, component 3D data reflects 83% effective and 17% highly effective practices  from our educators.

Throughout a  thorough analysis of our 2017-2018 Advance MOTP data, 3D was analyzed as the lowest scoring component across all  Danielson domains.    During the 2018-19 school year, P721R will target its focus on refining assessment practices to ensure that analysis of  data provides actionable feedback that ensures all students are aware of their next learning steps to increase  achievement. Administration will also will provide the opportunity for our teachers receive training in all aspects of  Domain 3D including its subsets of the Danielson Framework in order to target more rigorous, effective teaching  strategies.       P71R has developed a comprehensive theory of action based on the area of 3D: Using assessment in instruction that  will be communicated as part of our 2018-2019 school-wide vision:    1.  We believe if teachers use assessment tools to collect data for all students, then teachers will be able to   clearly articulate what students know and are able to do.    2.   If teachers are able to understand what students know and are able to do, then teachers can identify priority  skills and content they need to teach.    3.   If teachers identify new content and skills through a thorough task analysis and use of data, student outcomes  and achievement will be improved.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, teachers will utilize assessment in instruction as measured by an average growth of 5% as evidenced by a  comparison of MOTP Advance rating in Domain 3D from the 2017 –2018 school year to the 2018 – 2019 school year.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed  to impact change.

At the Hungerford School the Parent Coordinator participates in District 75 Borough based workshops to increase  awareness of creating long-lasting and effective parents partnerships. The District Office offers 4 Parent Coordinator  meetings per year and the Office of Family & Community Engagement (FACE) also offers workshops for Parent  Coordinators. D75 topics include Creating a Welcoming Environment, transition, IEPs, SESIS, Health Care Options, and  Bi-cultural Parent Engagement. From these partnerships, parents have expressed an interest in increased  opportunities for their children to gain vocation and pre-vocational experiences from through work-study and work  readiness programs. Our job developer and transition coordinator have reached out to the community to cultivate  programs where our students are ensured these experiences. During the 2017-18 school year, we worked on fostering  new and maintaining current our family relationships. P721R will work toward increasing opportunities for families to  get involved in extracurricular activities and workshops that are targeted at empowering parents.       Understanding the dynamics of a family unit helps gauge the needs of a student and often relates directly to  behavioral or school issues that may arise throughout the course of their educational career. Establishing a copious  and constructive relationship with parents is the foundation of understanding the inner dynamics of our students,  especially those who may be non-verbal. Parents or caregivers are the best source for understanding how the student  may generalize academic work to their home atmosphere, utilize coping mechanisms, or bridge the gap between  school and home life which is often a separate entity for our students. In the 2017 – 2018 school year, parent  workshops were only offered during the school day. During informal meetings, parent teacher conferences, and IEP  meetings, parents have expressed their concerns about this being an inconvenient time based on their schedule.  During the 2017 – 2018 school year there was initiative of holding Promise meetings on the weekend, which resulted  in higher parent involvement and attendance. Previously, when Promise meetings were held during school hours  there was minimal involvement and attendance. This showed the need to move parent workshops to take place also  after school hours and on the weekends in order to increase parent attendance rates.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties.

NA        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)                                 Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   0    0    0    0    0      1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 75R721, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      75R721 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)       School-Parent Compact (SPC)   75R721, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.

It is our goal that the program will support and  develop skills for ELL students to use at home, in the community and at work.  ELL students  will acquire functional culinary skills that will enable them to become independent and seek  gainful employment.  In order to meet this goal, ENL instruction addresses the New Language  Arts Progressions, Common Core Learning Standards and the Career Development and  Occupational Studies (CDOS). The emphasis placed on various benchmarks is adjusted to  individual student needs.    The proposed Title III weekend school program, "Celebrating Language through the Culinary  Arts" will involve preparing, cooking, serving and sampling dishes from the different cultures  represented by the participating students. The academic portion of the program will increase  communication, socialization, and language skills in the areas of reading and writing. These two  modalities were areas of need identified in the NYSESLAT 2018 results. Technology will be  infused in all aspects of the program.  Students will view cooking shows, research recipes and participate in discussions related to the  specific cultures studied. Education has shown us that learning is relevant and meaningful for  students when it captures their experiences.  They relate to their own experiences; acquire new  skills and apply and transfer them in the real world.   We want to encourage student and  parent/guardian participation by celebrating their heritage and culture. Families may contribute  to the program's success by submitting their own cultural recipes.  A recipe book will be  compiled as a final work product.  The program will consist of the following goals:  ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  Our program will provide a total 11 instructional sessions (3 Saturday sessions and 8 Sunday  sessions). to take place on from January through March 2019. Each session will last 4 hours  (8:00am to 12:00pm). The 3 Saturday sessions will be led by one ENL teacher supported by one  paraprofessional, and serve 12 students with a 12:1:1 ratio. The 8 Sunday sessions will be led by  both ENL teachers supported by 2 paraprofessionals, and serve 24 students with a 12:1:1 ratio.  The students will be divided into two groups (7-9 grades and 10 -12 grades). Instruction will be  provided in English. Saturday sessions will be provided only for the students.

One ENL Spanish-speaking teacher and one of the  paraprofessionals, will shelter the language for Spanish speaking students.  Parents and students will engage in "hands-on" differentiated activities (baking, cooking,  chopping, decorating, etc.). The multicultural aspect of the activities will be reinforced during  academic based discussions about the tools and procedures used to create each dish. A "pilon" (a  tool used by many Latin countries to mash spices prior to cooking) is an example of a tool to be  used.  The students’ final work product (the book of recipes) will be displayed in the culinary  arts kitchen of the school.  In order to enhance instruction and facilitate student access to the content presented, our ENL  teachers and paraprofessionals will integrate technology, such as IPads, Smartboards and  computers into all aspects of the program.  ELL students will be provided with opportunities to  engage in individual and cooperative learning activities that will promote English language  acquisition and increase their confidence level.  At the end of each session, staff members and parents will discuss ideas for reinforcing the  activities with their children at home.  Parents will be exposed to a variety of writing styles  serving as models for their own writing.  The final Sunday , we will have a celebration of  cultural dishes and families will receive the book of recipes created during the program.  rease  language skills and ability and interaction.

The  ENL teachers will conduct 3 one hour PD sessions on selected Sundays (7:00am to 8:00am) for  the paraprofessionals and supervising administrators, from January  to March 2019. Each session  will explore a different chapter from the text.  PD sessions will focus on ready to use strategies,  tools and activities for teaching ELLs at all levels. Discussion among the team will include ENL  methodologies and strategies from the text that will be utilized throughout our Title III program.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  P721R utilizes the Student Annual Needs Determination Inventory (SANDI), a comprehensive assessment program, that aligns  assessment to instruction, provides access to grade level standards, and specifically targets individual student strengths and  needs. The SANDI addresses student needs by providing an assessment tool to determine functional skill areas and the  corresponding focus statements of the New York State Common Core Standards (CCLS). The SANDI provides a basis to  determine educational benefits related to the student’s present levels of performance, progress on the Individual Education  Program (IEP) goals and identification of educational needs. All goals are aligned to CCLS and provide our students with an  entry point to access the CCLS in a way that is meaningful and functional.   We also utilize Achieve3000. This web based program provides an individualized learning solution to accelerate reading  comprehension, vocabulary, writing proficiency and performance. There is one high interest topic for the entire class,  scientifically matched to each student's individual Lexile reading level. Keys to successful learning is using material that  students find relevant and interesting while differentiating content to meet each student's unique leaner profile. The diversity   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      of students in a class makes it difficult to both find content that motivates all students and at each student's level of  performance. The use of a wide range of high-interest and current articles in Achieve3000 helps to ensure that students will  find something that engages their interest. The daily e-mail sets the stage for a learning experience that is designed to help  every student maximize his or her potential by introducing the topic of the article using vocabulary and questions appropriate  for their reading level.  Our NYSAA results in continued improvement with the students indicating that 8 students earned a 4 in Math, 5 earned a 4 in  reading, 6 earned a 4 in science and 6 earned a 4 in Social Studies. We are planning to address writing and social studies having  more enrichment activities in creative writing and global studies for the students and their families this school year.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   P721R administers the SANDI twice a year in fall and spring. ENL Teachers utilize data from results of SANDI to plan lessons and  individualize instruction.  Examination of SANDI reports is conducted at the time of a student's annual IEP conference and  periodically during the school year.  An integral part of the ENL structure at P 721R is to coordinate and implement school,  instructional and curriculum policy with established procedures.  In accordance with the Curriculum Team, the School  Based Coach develops and  provides monthly curriculum in each content area.  The monthly pacing calendar is distributed by  P721R during the 683 summer program.  The Unit Planning Tool for each content area is provided each month. The Unit  Planning Tool is aligned with the CCLS and include learning targets, vocabulary, instructional activities, resources such as  Brainpop and Discovery Education, as well as culminating task rubric for each content area.  Lesson plans and instruction  developed by ENL Teachers for Ells students are aligned with P721R's comprehensive and structured curriculum program.        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our program is evaluated by the progress made by in linguistic proficiency on State assessments specifically NYSAA.  Our  school does not receive an AYP report.  However, the team analyzes the test history and scores of NYSAA. Informal testing  such as teacher (ENL) made tests and quizzes are conducted throughout the school year to determine student level of  performance.  We also examine the outcomes of IEP goals and report card grades per quarter including the 683 program.  Our NYSAA results in continued improvement with the students indicating that 13 students earned a 4 in Math, 6 earned a 4 in  reading, 4 earned a 4 in science and 3 earned a 4 in Social Studies. We are planning to address writing and social studies having  more enrichment activities in creative writing and global studies for the students and their families this school year     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    At P721R, we have a school based coach who works in coordination with the English as a New Language (ENL) teachers to  meet each student’s needs. Together, we share data and best practices to accommodate the needs of each individual ELL. All  teachers meet within their PLC group to discuss strategies and implementation of instruction. Related services also attend  professional development opportunities in which they share data, plan instruction, and collaborate as teams to produce high- quality research-based instruction.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school does not serve students in grades K-5.  However, RTI approaches will be incorporated into the teaching strategies  for students who have not made progress after 6 months.        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The Spring 2017  NYSESLAT revealed that 100% of our Ells participated in the assessment- 33 are at the Entering Level, 26 are  at the Emerging Level.  Nine students are at the Transitioning Level and 2 Student is at the Expanding Level.  No students  scored at the Commanding Level.  Results also reveal students are making gains in the reading, speaking and listening  modalities of the exam as indicated previously.   As we examine the results of the NYSESLAT we observed that 12 students made significant gains in listening, 4 students in  speaking, and 13 students in reading.  Two students made gains in writing.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64            7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Upon receiving the 2018 scores as evidenced on the RLAT, the ENL Teachers examine and analyze the results to determine  each student's level of proficiency as compared to the previous 2017 results.   The information from the 2018 RLAT is applied  for each student . In order to make adjustments, all teachers meet within their PLC group to discuss strategies and  implementation of instruction. Related services also attend professional development opportunities in which they share data,  plan instruction, and collaborate as teams to produce high-quality research-based instruction.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.           Currently our school features an ENL program only. The ENL program at the Hungerford School delivers English  instruction to qualifying students using two different models: Integrated and a  stand alone model.  The number of  ENL instructional units that a student receives is determined by the student English language proficiency levels (as  determined by the NYSITELL or NYSESLAT scores). The ENL teachers provide support and assists the ELL students in  the content areas and with specific needs. Specifically, the ENL teacher helps students by facilitating small groups  determined by the student's IEP classification in guided reading which is a component of the balanced literacy  program.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?          ELLs at P721R are at the entering level of English language proficiency as determined by NYSESLAT.   Currently, ELL  students are provided  the minimum required minutes of ENL instruction in as much as this is possible.  Our ELL students have  a variety of disabilities on a severe and profound range including autism, cognitive, emotional,  sensory and physical  disabilities. They are instructed in 12:1:1, 12:1:4, and 6:1:1 ratios as determined by their IEP. All students participate in  Alternate Assessments only.    While there are 5 proficiency levels for the ELL student,  our students scored as follows: 39 are at the Entering Level, 23 are at  the Emerging Level.  Four students are at the Transitioning Level and 1 Student is at the Expanding Level.  No students scored  at the Commanding Level.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      For ELLs at P721R content area is provided as follows: Our ENL teachers are continuing to infuse ENL instruction with content  area materials.  Our school follows the NYSAA -ELA and MAth Extensions and AGLIS for Social Studies and Math.  The language  of all instruction is English. ENL strategies include: The Language Experience Approach, the Natural Approach, and strategies   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      for scaffolding instruction during cooperative learning activities (including the use of graphic organizers). Content area  instruction follows the Common Core Learning  standards and Core Curricula for Content Area teaching (with the necessary  modifications) in mathematics, science, and social studies. Content area instruction is aligned to Alternate Grade Level  Indicators (AGLIs) in each content area.  Particular focus is given to preparing students for competitive, supported, and  sheltered employment. This is addressed through the NYS Career Development and Occupational Studies (CDOS) learning  standards and alternate performance indicators (APIs). Job-skills, functional and literacy skill development are infused  throughout all aspects of instruction.  The instructional support of Ells includes their use of technology and provision  of  multisensory and multicultural materials.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   To support native language development many of our students are provided with Alternative Placement Bilingual  Paraprofessionals, who speak their native language, as mandated by their IEP. Other bilingual staff, including classroom  teachers, provides native language assistance to students throughout the day.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    When we have a SIFE student or a  newcomer present at our school, we  employ  specific instructional strategies to assist these students.  These special needs  students require an opportunity to acclimate to  the school setting.   The ENL teachers initiate "survival English" for everyday activities.  Consultation is conducted with the classroom  teachers for a coordinated approach and includes the classroom team of paras and related service providers.  The classroom  teachers also receive consultation from the ENL teachers regarding  methodologies and strategies.  ENL teachers emphasize  relevant language used in the student's everyday life. Teachers, paras and related service providers ae continuously  encouraged to participate in the 10 hours of Jose P. training to enhance their knowledge and skill for teaching the ELL student.      0ur plan for Ell students in our school for less than three years is as follow:  •     Focus on the development of academic and functional language   •     Students receive the application of strategies and techniques such as the following:  Tutoring, buddy,  nurturing environment  to facilitate language production and after school programs.       Our plan for ELL students receiving service for 4-6 years is as follows:    *     Lesson plans address areas of weakness and authentic ENL learning experiences.  *     Emphasis is placed on the development of discrete language skills and academic language proficiency.       Our transitional plan for long-term ELLs is as follows: Students who have not mastered the Common Core Learning  Standards will continue to have ENL instruction targeted to their needs, their progress closely monitored with  assessment  completed periodically.      Students who no longer require Bilingual or ENL services according to IEP will be supported for two years with ENL services.             6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ENL strategies and approaches such as Total Physical Response (TPR), Language Experience Approach, Graphic organizers, and  Cooperative Learning are also used. Technology is an integral part of the long term ELLs plan. Computers are used for   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      multimedia projects, accessing information, word processing, publishing, reading and drills. Computer programs have also  proven to be valuable resources for introducing or reinforcing content area concepts and augmenting English language skills.      The following materials are used to support our ELLs in ELA, math, science and social studies:  *Mayer Johnson Symbols    *Achieve 3000- Integrates technology with the regular classroom curriculum.  *Star reported- Daily theme-based and differentiated lessons targeting all academic areas delivered in a small group setting  during the school day.  *Adapted Weekly Reader (ABLENET)- Adapted literacy, math, science and social studies instruction deliverd in a small group  setting uring the school day.  * AIS is provided during the school day, and is seamlessly integrated into the TEACCH and Workshop models, wherever  applicable.  To effectively teach  students the teacher provides structure, i.e., set up the classroom so that students  understand where to be, what to do, and how to do it, all as independently as possible. TEACCH provides clinical services such  as diagnostic evaluations; parent training and parent support groups, social play and recreation groups, individual counseling  for higher-functioning clients, and supported employment.    *Paraprofessionals work on specific, focused skills during small group instruction, utilizing strategies which may include  Activating Prior Knowledge, Computer Assisted Instruction, Cooperative/Collaborative Learning, Developing Critical Thinking  Skills, Arts Integration, Flexible Skill Groups, Small Group Instruction, Functional Skill Development, flexible Skill Groups,  Thinking Maps, Hands-On Science Instruction, Modification of Text and Curriculum, Small Group Instruction, Use of Visuals and  Guided reading.     Required services supports are modified in order to differentiate for the needs of each student. Materials are modified and  Teacher- made in order to be age-appropriate.  Books and materials in the classrooms are adapted, age appropriate, reflect the heritage culture of students and are  multisensory. We continue to provide technology (i.e., Smart Board, AAC devices, Rosetta Stone Software,).     The Intervention services  for ELLs in ELA, math, and other content areas is provided as follows:  Content area instruction  follows the Common Core Learning standards for Content Area teaching in mathematics, science, and social studies and is  aligned to Alternate Grade Level Indicators (AGLIs) in each content area. Particular focus is given to preparing students for  competitive, supported, and sheltered employment and this is addressed through the NYS Career Development and  Occupational Studies (CDOS) learning standards and alternate performance indicators (APIs). Job-skills, functional and literacy  skills development are infused throughout all aspects of instruction, asa are technology, multisensory and multicultural  materials, all of which support the instruction of  ELLs. ESL strategies include: The Language Experience Approach, the Natural  Approach, and strategies for scaffolding instruction during cooperative learning activities (including the use of graphic  organizers).   The materials used in our school are age appropriate for all of our students.          7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  All ELLs are invited to participate in the school;s supplemental Saturday and Sunday Title III program. For the 2018-2019 school  year new programs that we continue to implement are Unique Learning Curriculum, Achieve 3000, and Rosetta Stone. The  proposed Title III after school program involves performance poetry, visual arts, play writing and drama to increase  communication, socialization and language skills. According to Champions of Change:  The Impact of the Arts on Learning  (1999), seven major research studies provide evidence of enhanced learning and achievement when students are involved in a  variety of arts experiences.  The studies reveal that the arts:  -     Reach students who are not otherwise being reached.  -     Reach students in ways that they are not otherwise being reached  -     Connect students to themselves and each other  -     Transform the environment for learning  -     Provide learning opportunities for the adults in the lives of young people   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      -     Connect learning experiences to the world of real work.  Our school does not have non-disabled peers for our students, nor  ICT classes.  However, students are encouraged to participate in community activities with their classes and/or their  families.  This will allow them to interact with other children.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Based on the ELA, mathematics, science, and social core curriculum, instruction will be focused on the areas in which ELL  students demonstrate the greatest need for improvement as determined by their NYSESLAT scores, NYSAA scores and IEP  goals. Additional opportunities will be provided for students to participate in scaffolded project-based learning, using rubrics  (for self-regulation/to check work), multisensory and multicultural materials, through cooperative groups in the  aforementioned areas of concern.  Our school has many multi-lingual staff members who provide support to a student, when  the child does not understand.  Our school offers only a Stand Alone.  However, bilingual students have alternate placement  paras required by the IEP and they offer levels of support for the child.  The specific interventions and curricular using age  appropriate materials are listed in the previous question.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      P721 does not currently have a new program for this school year.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A           11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  To provide equal access , all ELLs are invited to participate in the school's supplemental Saturday and Sunday Title III program.  For the 2018-2019 school year, we will continue to implement programs such as Unique Learning Curriculum, Achieve 3000.  The proposed Title III after school program involves performance poetry, visual arts, play writing and drama to increase  communication, socialization and language skills. According to Champions of Change:  The Impact of the Arts on Learning  (1999), seven major research studies provide evidence of enhanced learning and achievement when students are involved in a  variety of arts experiences.  The studies reveal that the arts:  -     Reach students who are not otherwise being reached.  -     Reach students in ways that they are not otherwise being reached  -     Connect students to themselves and each other  -     Transform the environment for learning  -     Provide learning opportunities for the adults in the lives of young people  -     Connect learning experiences to the world of real work     In addition to the TItle III program our students, in middle school, can participate in the Middle school After School  Program.  They are also invited to participate in Champs after school.  This program is for our middle school and high school  aged students. Students who participate are given transportation home from the after school program.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  A variety of instructional and language materials are used to address content areas. Educational games address ELA concepts  such as sight word recognition, sentence building as well as letter and sound identification.  Multisensory materials, pictures  and manipulatives are used in addition to the spoken and written word to prompt and elicit student response.  We continue to  integrate technology (i.e., Smart Board, AAC devices) into daily instruction.  Online programs such as Discovery, Reading A to Z  and Brainpop have been purchased through subscription by 721R.  ENL Teachers integrate these online programs into  instruction.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         In the ENL program, ELLs receive native language support through alternate placement paraprofessionals. They provide native- language support and cross-cultural connections for the ELLs who are entitled to bilingual instructional services.  Students with  a classification of BIS receive the application of strategies and techniques such as the following:  Tutoring, buddy, nurturing  environment to facilitate language production and after school programs.            14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All ELL students receive the services that are mandated by their Individualized Education Plan (IEP). These services may include  speech, counseling, occupational and physical therapy, vision, hearing services as well as specific equipment.  The IEP defines  specifically the functioning level of the ELL as well as the chronological age.  The services and strategies used, the modifications  needed are listed on the IEP and adhered to. The team ensures that all needs are met for each child.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The ENL program functions in 7 off sites under the auspices of the Hungerford School- P721R and District 75.  We follow the  instructional and operational policies and procedures of P 721R in each site.  Instruction is coordinated and implemented by  the administration and School Based Coach.  We have the cooperation and support of the home principal who works closely  with our  administration to ensure a positive coexisting between the two schools. ENL Teachers adhere to student's IEP and  test scores (NYCESLAT, NYSAA, SANDI) to ensure all of Ells needs.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled Ell students and their parents meet with members of the administration and school staff including parent  coordinator, school nurse and IEP Coordinator.  The parent coordinator provides parents with information about community  resources, transition and legal issues such as guardianship.  ENL Teachers are actively involved in introducing the students to  the school.  Information relevant to an Ells student and parent is provided.  ENL Teachers discuss the Title III Weekend Program  and after school programs.  This process is continual during the  school year.            17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Currently our school does not offer any language electives to ELLS because of the mandates on each student's IEP.  Students at  P 721R participate in alternate assessment.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Currently our school only features ENL programs.      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  During the 2018-2019 school year, P721R’S professional development plan will include issues pertaining to the education of  Ells.   Teachers, paraprofessionals, administrators and support staff participate in professional development conducted by P  721R on a continual and comprehensive basis during the school year.  Professional development activities are conducted by  various school personnel such as literacy coach, transition coordinator, sesis/IEP coordinator, technology coordinator and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69         Parent Coordinator.  Professional development activities include such areas as instructional curriculum  and training on  assessment for alternate assessment students.    In addition to full day agenda of activities, P 721R provides small group and  individual professional development.  P721 has a curriculum team who develop guidelines and provide a monthly pacing calendar and curriculum guide to teachers  in the respective cohorts of 6:1:1, 12:1:1 and 12:1:4.  Each cohort meets weekly as part of the professional learning community  (PLC). It is within this structure that ENL teachers participate to support ELLs.  Jose P training is conducted by District 75 for teachers new to the DOE.    The professional development plan of P 721R includes topics such as Multi-level Learning, Planning Thematic Units for ELLS,  AND Designing Effective Classroom Activities for ELLS.    Ongoing support is being provided by the District 75 Office of ELL. District 75 PD focuses on compliance issues  as well as using  technology and learning experiences.            2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  After participating in mandated Jose P training, teachers will provide a copy of the certificate to payroll secretary at P721.  The  certificate will be kept in each teacher's professional file.   P721 R provides training to school staff including related service  providers and guidance counselors in such areas as:   Functional Behavior Assessment/Behavior Intervention Plan, Behavioral  Crisis De-escalation/Intervention, Chancellor's Regulations and Curriculum.  In addition to presenting to New Teacher Institute  (NTI) they are offering training to cohorts (6:1:1, 12:1:1 and 12:1:4) in our school.   Agendas will be kept on file with the staff  sign in attendance sheets.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?    meetings with ELL parents are conducted thought the academic year to discuss goals of program, language development  progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development need in all content areas. The goal of these  meetings is to inform parents regarding the learning experience of their children and to reinforce the connection between the  instructional goals of the school and the home experience. The expectation with these meetings is to discuss and provide  concrete information to parents about their child’s academic content and language development progress and needs.  Translation is provided if needed.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The parental involvement at The Richard Hungerford School is enhanced and encouraged through the office of the parent  coordinator.  The parent coordinator performs as a liaison between the parents and school by communicating and translating  with the families and guardians of English Language Learners. Translation of school documents and any other information that  needs to be sent home is provided. In addition, interpretation services will be provided, as needed in the seventeen foreign  languages present at P721 R.  The services of the Department of Education- Translation and Interpretation Unit are used.  Parent outreach includes opportunities for orientation meetings and other meetings throughout the school year. Parents of  ELLs are always invited and encouraged to participate in parent- teacher conferences, IEP meetings, and the After School Title  lll Program.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kristin McHugh, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Richard H.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The identification process for students entitled as ELLs is conducted in accordance with the NYSED - ELL  Identification Process as per CR Part 154. Parents/guardians of incoming students are administered the Home  Language Identification Survey (HLIS) in English and their preferred home language by a licensed pedagogue  trained in ELL related matters. An informalinterview is conducted with both the parent and the student (if  possible). The informal interview gives a preliminary assessment of a student's understanding of, and ability to  speak the English language.   If the home language is English, the teacher stops the ELL Identification Process and a notation is made. The  notation indicates that the student only speaks English and "NO" is entered as the OTELE code. If a language other  than English is spoken in the home, the Language Proficiency Team (LPT) meets to review the information and  determine whether the student should be administered the NYSITELL. teacher administers the NYSITELL to  determine eligibility.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74      If the student is determined to be an ELL and his/her home language is Spanish, a Spanish LAB will be  administered in addition. The ENLS teachers administered the Spanish LAB if needed. We make an attempt to  administer during the same time period as the LAB. If the LAB indicates that the student is not proficient in  English, the parents are invited to a meeting to discuss the English Language Learner (ELL) program options for  their child. Every spring our ELLs take the New York State English as a Second Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) and  the school make sure that all four tests (Listening, speaking, reading and writing) are administer to the all ELLs  (i.e., to ELLs in ENL classes, ELLs with alternate placement paraprofessionals and to those ELLs that are served as  per their IEP). To ensure all ELLs receive the New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test  (NYSESLAT) the school utilizes various ATS reports (i.e., RLER, RLAT, RPEX, REXH, RMNR). Our ENL teachers  administer the New York State English as a Second Language Assessment Test ( NYSESLAT) to all of our ELLs. We  then ask parents about their comfort level with English. When we determine that the parent prefers notices in  home language we make plans accordingly. At this time we serve students whose home languages are Arabic,  Spanish, Chinese, Polish, Albanian, and Bengali. We use DOE Office of Translation Services to provide translation  in the home language. We also have available an interpreter for oral language for deaf parents. We contact the  Office of Translation to translate all school notices, newsletters, and interview forms, when we have no one in our  school building that can provide translations.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

The Hungerford School utilizes a  rigorous translation system for  parents of our ELLs in 17 different  languages. At the beginning of the  2017-2018 and 2018-2019 school  year, identification of parents who  require translation and interpretation  in their home language is developed.  In addition a list of identified parents  requiring translation and  interpretation is disseminated to the  main office of each site. Procedures  consist of the following: Staff  personnel translate documents in the  respective language. In the case of  languages not available within the  school community, consultation is  conducted with the DOE Translation  and Interpretation Unit (T&I Unit). The  T&I Unit employs an over-the-phone  service for school staff to have access  for verbal translation such as IEP  conferences. P721R also avails itself  with templates provided by the T&I  Unit such as Parent Teacher  Conference Templates, Recess and  Calendar Notifications, health forms,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77      -   -   -              April 2018   -   -   -   student report cards, parent  notification letters, opt out and  consent forms.

In the event of an emergency, parents will be notified through our automated school notification system. The list of  parents who require translation and interpretation in their home language is available at each site. A school staff  member who speaks the home language of the parent contacts the family. Depending upon the emergency  conditions, students may be released from a designated area to parents with proper identification. For safety reasons,  children will only be released to an adult who has been properly designated as an emergency contact and who has  proper identification. Emergency cards containing specified information are available in the main office of every  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78      school.Parents are required to complete an Emergency Form for each student each year. It is critical that the  information on the Form is complete and up to date.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Staff members are aware that LEP parents are provided with access to programs and services critical to their child's  education. P721R adheres to a policy of increasing parental awareness. To achieve this goal, all staff members will be  provided with a copy of established protocols for accessing the services of the Translation and Interpretation Unit.  Included in the communication to staff are available and current resources for LEP parents.                       Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Our school will fulfill section VII of Chancellor's Regulations A-663 as evidenced by a posting at the main door and a  language sign to identify parent's home language by the security desk. The posting and sign at the designated  locations will consist of the eight identified languages as determined by the Translation and Interpretation Unit. In  addition LEP parents will be informed of available resources located in the DOE website. Our Parent Coordinator turns  to the Office of Translation Services for translation of our monthly newsletters. In order to translate fliers, brochures  and letters to our LEP parents, the Parent Coordinator will refer to the established list of parents requiring translation.  If a staff member cannot translate the brochure, flyer or letter then the Parent Coordinator submits the written  material to the Office of Translation.  A Bill of Rights is sent to all ELL parents in their native language. We employ the  over-the-phone translation service to assist LEP parents.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       To gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services, the school primarily uses a parent survey.  The ENL Teachers utilize the results of the parent survey to communicate with parents regarding the quality of  services. The feedback is recorded on the Parent Communication Log to improve service.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80
