This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   P721K strives to foster an environment where students of all abilities are exposed to innovative, individualized,  rigorous, and research-based instruction that is data driven and will provide them with the necessary tools to achieve  the highest quality of life and independence possible. Development of strong community ties and parent outreach will  provide a collaborative environment that provides consistent expectations for students, both at home and at school.  A school culture of respect and trust among staff members and students is fostered through school-wide participation  and teacher collaboration in developing a set of shared values that drives instruction and school activities. We believe  that students learn best when instruction is student driven with an emphasis on student choice. Students are put on   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      the path to independence through specific instructional tracks that are set up in a hierarchical order, to help students  follow an organized progression that is differentiated and appropriate for learners of varied cognitive ability.  Instructional foci will address each individual student’s unique needs in the areas of literacy, math, science, social  studies, vocational training, physical and fine motor mobility, as well as social needs, to emotionally and skill fully  prepare students to play meaningful roles in their community during their high school and post-secondary careers.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   At P721K, we are a District 75 high school educating 508 students, grades 9-12 and K-2, servicing various instructional  settings which include hospital instruction, 6:1:1, 8:1:1, 8:1, 12:1:1, 12:1:4 student to staff settings, with one inclusion  setting. Our largest population of students range in age between 14 - 21. Our current demographics show that 80% of  our student population are self-contained and 31% of students are English Language Learners (ELL). Our school  requires a diverse and unique set of needs and more stakeholders than the average school, including self-contained  teachers, work site teachers, English as a New Language teachers, related service providers, paraprofessionals, school  aids and parents. All of these stakeholders must work together to inform the best Individualized Education Plans (IEP)  and Individual Transition Plans (ITP) to support our students during their time at our school and to prepare them for  their post-secondary careers. Our school partners with ten part-time and full-time local community businesses that  serve as external vocational training programs, where students gain meaningful and employable skills to prepare  them for their post-secondary careers.    At the Roy Campanella Occupational Training Center, we host a variety of in-house vocational training centers  including a student-run cafeteria, a printing and technology centered classroom, an adaptive design wood shop, a  corner store, a bake shop, a student run coffee shop, a student culinary preparation program, as well as custodial  interns. We also host a variety of extracurricular programs such as our arts partnership programs which enables  students to participate in are LEAP, Laser Art Painting, New Victory Theatre, and The World Theatre Project. P721K  has also received Arts Grants from VSA Marquis Studios, Theatre for a New Audience, and The World Theatre Project  that include theatre tickets throughout the school year in which over 120 P721K students will attend live professional  performances in the heart of NYC's Theatre district. Additionally, we have a wheelchair accessible, student-run garden  that contains edible garden beds, as well as a native species habitat, which serves as an outdoor learning space where  students connect with nature, learn about agricultural, and environmental literacy. We host bi-annual events with  Garden to Café, which is a city program, sponsored by School Foods, that showcases seed to table practices and  exposes students to healthy eating habits by teaching students to prepare recipes from crops harvested in the garden.  Garden to Café works with our culinary preparation program to teach students to harvest their own food, prepare it,  and serve samples at school wide events.      Students are empowered to be self-advocates by engaging in a variety of planning sessions and by exercising their  power of choice throughout their school day. This process is complemented by continuous communication between  home and school throughout the school year and encourages parents to grow as advocates for their sons and  daughters. We teach our students and their families the importance of carrying identification at all times so  community members can provide assistance if/when necessary. We have placed great emphasis on students and  parents using ID cards provided by the school as a resource for transition for when students are out of the building.  Parents play an important role with the consistency of students using their ID's outside of school and have found this  resource helpful to ease transition.    Parent outreach will be continuous throughout the school year through in person parent training sessions, as well as  through regular letters, mass emails and texts using the Remind App. Parent training and events will provide parents  with information about transition planning, guardianship and linkage to the Office for People with Developmental  Disabilities, The IEP/ Transition Process, and Medicaid service providers/Case Management system. Information  sessions will be held on obtaining access to at home community habilitation services and home aid assistance. In  addition, we will continue to use the Remind App for the 2018-2019 school year, to enable teachers to create their  "own class" and send out simple text messages including pictures to parents to "Remind" them of upcoming   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      important events. The school administration can share important school updates with our parents at - large. We are  hopeful that this will be an easier platform for families to use to increase on-going consistent communication.    For the 2018 – 2019 school year, we will focus on using technology to align ongoing assessment to curricula and  integrating student IEP goals into instructional practices. We are partnering with Microsoft to integrate technology  into the classroom by providing one hundred and twenty Microsoft devices for students to use in the classrooms, to  enhance student engagement and provide rigorous and coherent ELA curricula. Additionally, we will use Attainment's  Pre-Employment Transition Solution (Pre-ETS) as part of our school's progress monitoring, which uses an online data  base to track data towards instructional goals and IEP goals for each individual student.    P721K was chosen as one of three D75 schools to partner with Alternate English Language Learning Assessment  Project (ALTELLA) for the 2018 Chapter 683 program. ALTELLA observed our English as a New Language (ENL)  teachers' instructional practice to develop a strong foundation in building an alternate assessment of English language  proficiency for English language learners with significant cognitive disabilities. This will help ensure that all students  have curricula and academic tasks that are accessible to students and meet their cognitive needs. Lastly, we are  implementing the use of SANDI kits for our level one students starting during the Fall 2018 SANDI assessment as a  pilot for District 75.    We will be implementing the Practical Assessment Exploration System (PAES) for the 2018-2019 school year. PAES is a  hands-on Comprehensive Work Development Curriculum operating in a converted classroom to simulate work  environments. In the PAES lab, students become employees and teachers become employers. Students will get the  feel of real work while learning and exploring new career vocational areas, using real tools, and developing proper  work behaviors. Teachers will use the PAES curriculum and resources to assess a student's competitive work potential  and interest level in the following five areas: Computer Technology, Construction/Industrial, Processing/Production,  Consumer/Service, Business/Marketing.   In collaboration with the SANDI developers and Lakeshore, P721K has joined the SANDI Instructional Pilot. The pilot is  working to show progress and skills development for our students with the most significant challenges. Our students  that score level 1 and may not move to a level 2, though there is growth to be seen within a level 1 student. In  October 2018, select teachers will attend a district training to understand the expectations for this opportunity and  learn how to use the kit for best practices during instruction and student activities. Through this effort, the  instructional kits will support teachers in providing the highest quality of academic support for their students.    For the 2018-2019 school year, teachers at our K-2 site will use Go Math! for the mathematics curriculum. Go Math!  supports teachers in differentiating instruction, building and reinforcing foundational math skills, and promoting best  practices to ensure student conceptual understanding, fluency, and application at appropriate levels. The wealth of  resources includes the tools students need to embrace math and succeed in assessments.   For the 2018-2019 school year, 9 High School teachers will be piloting the new ELA Curriculum ReadTopia. Readtopia  is a Don Johnson curriculum that aims to make learning to read an experience for all. Readtopia was specifically  designed to support classroom communities of learning made up of students working at multiple ability levels. The  District is supporting this collaborative partnership as they are paying for 5 of the 9 licenses being utilized for the  2018-2019 school year.    Readtopia supports students learning by addressing Mandates for Comprehensive Literacy Instruction in The Every  Student Succeeds Act. It includes the following:     developmentally appropriate, contextually explicit, and systematic instruction, and frequent practice, in      reading and writing across content areas  age-appropriate, explicit, systematic, and intentional instruction in phonological awareness, phonics  decoding, vocabulary, language structure, reading fluency, and reading comprehension      makes available and uses diverse, high-quality print materials that reflect the reading and development levels,   and interests, of children   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11        uses differentiated instructional approaches, including individual and small group instruction and discussion     provides opportunities for children to use language with peers and adults in order to develop language skills,   including developing vocabulary   includes frequent practice of reading and writing strategies       uses age-appropriate, valid, and reliable screening assessments, diagnostic assessments, formative   assessment processes, and summative assessments to identify a child's learning needs, to inform instruction,  and to monitor the child's progress and the effects of instruction     uses strategies to enhance children's motivation to read and write and children's engagement in self-directed        learning   incorporates the principles of universal design for learning   links literacy instruction to the challenging State academic standards, including the ability to navigate,  understand, and write about, complex print and digital subject matter.

Instruction at our school is closely associated with relevance and respect for students' needs and abilities allowing  them the opportunity for the highest learning outcomes. We strive to use multiple methods of data assessment to  propel student achievement and the development of their present levels of performance (PLOP). Students are  encouraged to be as independent as possible, and are given the necessary supports when needed. The lessons are  designed by teachers, with individual learning styles and student needs in mind. Hands-on practices and real life  experiences are the foundation of our instruction. We believe that students learn best when exposed to their  community and are able to explore and experience what is being taught. Our summative assessment tools,  curriculum, and formative assessments have been aligned to give teachers the tools necessary to provide rigorous  instruction within a “real life” environment for students, based on each student’s IEP and addressing the Citywide  Instructional Expectations (CIE).    Our school services students with a variety of management needs, 12.1.1, 6.1.1, 8.1.1, 8.1, 12.1.4, therefore, the  curriculum and assessments we use vary depending on the needs of each class/Quad. All student's needs are specific  regarding the delivery of instruction and the outcomes we strive for them to achieve.    Our 12:1:4 classrooms require specialized instruction in activities of daily living, specifically eating, drinking, feeding,  mobility, transportation, activities related to health and safety, toileting and dressing. The related service providers  who work with the 12:1:4 classrooms are specialized in feeding and mobility. Our 12:1:4 classrooms require extensive  scaffolding to ensure the students have access to rigorous classroom activities that meets their cognitive abilities.  These students require hands on activities and manipultives to ensure that all students are intellectually and actively  engaged in challenging content.    The 6:1:1 classes follow a curriculum called Essentials for Living, which is specifically designed to teach  communication, daily living and adaptive behavior skills to students with severe to moderate disabilities, who have  limited or alternative methods of speaking. This curriculum also serves as an assessment, which determines which  skills have been acquired, as well as skill deficits, which are recorded on annual performance assessments that allow  teachers to track individual student progress from year to year. The curriculum focuses on eight domains which  includes: requesting, listener response, answering questions, daily living skills, functional academic skills (math,  responding to text, reading and writing), tolerating new situations and maladaptive behaviors.    Students in a 6:1:1 setting, who progress and score highly on the performance assessments, are promoted to an 8:1:1  class, where dependent on their age, students will focus on academics or participate in work-based learning. Similarly,  students who score highly on assessments in the 8:1:1 setting will be promoted to a 12:1:1 class. Our 8:1:1 and 12:1:1  classes follow the Unique curriculum for ELA, the Attainment curriculum for vocational and daily living skills, and the  Equals curriculum for math.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      The overall ongoing goal is to move students to a less restrictive environment and less restrictive services so that they  can independently and actively participate as citizens in their communities. We have had great success in achieving  this for our students.    During the 2017 – 2018 school year, nine students were thoroughly interviewed, screened through a skills assessment  and selected for a competitive employment internship. The students interned at three different employment settings,  gaining valuable and varied skill sets to prepare them for competitive, paid employment. As a result of the program,  five students are currently employed and two are seeking paid employment.    Of the 474 students in our school organization, 161 are English Language Learner/Limited English Proficient (ELL/LEP)  students (32.5% of our student population). We have 6 Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) classes namely: one  12:1:1 (Yiddish) class, three Spanish classes (two Spanish HS 12:1:1, 12:1:4 and one 6:1:1 K-2), two Mandarin classes  (12:1: HS and 6:1:1 K-2), and ENL Stand Alone / Integrated ENL programs at P721K. The remaining bilingual mandated  students have alternate placement paraprofessionals who speak the students’ native languages and receive the  services of a certified ENL teacher in class ratios of 12:1:4, 12:1:1. 6:1:1 and 8:1:1. The languages of the alternate  placement paraprofessional are: Arabic, Cantonese, Haitian Creole, Hebrew, Mandarin, Russian, Spanish, Urdu, and  Yiddish.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Instructional Core   Curriculum, Pedagogy, and Assessment      Instructional Tracking   721K’s diverse learning populations prompted the school to create the P721K Instructional Track to create a  meaningful, integrated, and progressive academic and vocational program for learning with ages ranging from K to  2nd grade years, and HS 14-21 years old. The use of Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS), the student's IEP goals  and related service mandates, the Measures of Student Learning (MOSL) for students in Alternate Assessment  (NYSAA), and the need for a pertinent age-appropriate curricula (Unique, Equals, Attainment – Transition,  STEMScopes, and other subject areas such as Music, Adapted PE, and CDOS). We use both summative assessment  such as the Students Annual Needs Determination Inventory (SANDI) and formative assessments such as the  Formative Assessment of Standards Tasks (FAST) to monitor student progress towards expected learning outcomes.  Our school learning community utilizes various curricula that meet the needs of our students in their different  developmental stages (age/levels of maturity/ cognitive abilities. Therefore, the development and use of a  comprehensive and progressive 7-Year P721K Instructional Track is meant to ensure appropriate, high quality  supports so that all learners can have multiple entry points into the curricula.    Our K to 2nd Grade Track (P721K@PB21K) consists of five classes of 6:1:1 students who are diagnosed with Autism.  This track utilizes the following curriculum: FUNdations for Reading, Equals K-12 for Math, Passport for Social  Students, ABLLS-R for ELA with ABA-VB methodologies, and STEMScopes as a resource for teaching Science. In order  to continue to challenge our students and prepare them for a less restrictive environment, the teachers and  administration made the collaborative decision to purchase the Go Math curriculum. This curriculum follows a  standardized scope and sequence for students who are in general education classes. This will provide access to our K- 2 students for more challenging content and push our teachers to provide a greater depth of direct instruction.    Track 1 and Track 2 are divided into academic programming for students ages 14-16 (Track A), for students ages 17-18  (Track B), for students ages 19-21 (Track C). The SANDI and FAST assessments are used to track school wide progress  in Reading, Writing, Math, Communication, and Transition. Track 1 is mostly for students who are in our 12:1:1  program or those that are academically proficient. This track utilizes the following curricula: Unique Learning System's   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      High School (Track A,B) and Transition band (Track B, mostly C) for ELA, the Equals Curriculum for Math (K-12 for Track  A,B and Pre-Geometry and Pre-Algebra for Track B, mostly C), the Attainment Transition Curriculum (2 books assigned  for each Track A, B, and C). Track 1 progresses from academic-focused activities to part-time exposure to our in-house  work-study programs such as Print Shop, Adaptive Design, Corner Store, Culinary program, etc. Then eventually,  moving to Track C where students are given more opportunities for a more frequent part-time work-study program  participation (ranging from 3 days to 5 days per week) for certain periods within the school day.    Track 2 is similar to Track 1, however, the difference is the student to staff ratios, such as 6:1:1, 8:1:1, and our 12:1:4.    The Inclusion Track (P721K@JDHS) consists of two classes, which participated in the academic and CDOS program  offered in John Dewey High School. Students from our Track 1 and some students from Track 2 were given the  opportunity for this LRE movement in our P721K Instructional Track.    The Internship Track consists of eight full-time community-based learning programs which provides students with the  opportunity to practice soft and hard work skills and habits in the community. There is also movement among  students from one work site to the next and eventually to becoming independent travelers and full-time volunteer or  paid internship programs.    Data is taken from school-wide assessments to inform data based movement within the instructional tracks, as well as  the worksites. The SANDI Vocational assessments are administered to students to help dictate which students are  ready to move as well as identification of key skills each worksite requires. Additionally, professional learning  community (PLC)/Quads teams make suggestions based on data analysis, academic-evidence, checklists, and student  work performance if students are ready to move on to the next least restrictive environment in our P721K  instructional track. Overall, the instructional tracks provide a wide range of opportunities and experiences which lead  our students to independence in the world of work and helps to prepare them for their post-secondary careers.       2017 – 2018 HIGHLIGHTS   Transitional Bilingual Education   During the 2017 – 2018 school year, we prepared to open 6:1:1, K - 2, Bilingual Spanish and Bilingual Chinese classes  for the 2018 – 2019 school year. We received the Project ProELL, Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) Planning Grant  for Grades K – 12 (Spanish) and K-2 (Chinese).

MET Partnership Outcomes:    1.  Building on the SCANA (Self-control, Communication, Navigation and Advocacy) program developed by Ms.   Cantor and Ms. Keller, we were able to foster the development of skills students are honing in order to enter  the work force.    2.  Self-Control/Navigation - Students identify several ways visitors to a museum can check in on their self-  control. For instance, students created drawings of a museum galleries that included feather list barriers,  railings, floor tape, alarms, and Plexiglas cases to protect works of are, and remind visitors to check their  behavior.    3.  Through works of art, including, Jackson Pollock's Autumn Rhythm, and examples of Chinese calligraphy. They   discussed how "self-control" can take several forms, and socially appropriate in different settings.    4.  Communication/Advocacybetween the sending and third museum visit, every student communicated at least   one feeling or idea about a work of art, and 64% of students on the two trips to the museum asked a  classmate their opinion of a work of art.    5.  Between the two museum visits, 72% of students were able to back up a claim about a work of art with visual   evidence.    6.  Evaluated student outcomes: In order to measure success, we created a rubric of observable student   outcomes for Museum visits.

Students from our 6:1:1  classes started actively working during July 2017 and this partnership has extended into the 2017-2018 school year.  Students participate in many vocational activities there including: park maintenance and cleanup, visitor center  organization. The work site has expanded to the Historic Airplane Restoration Project (HARP) where students perform  janitorial duties in the airplane hangar, as well as wash down some of the planes.    Opening of a new work site at Brooklyn Public Library Sheepshead Bay Branch for 12:1:1 students in our Library Quad  2. Students started actively working in the Brooklyn Library October 2017 and extended throughout the 2017-2018  school year. Students participated in many vocational tasks while refining their library knowledge. These skills include:  shelving books according to genre, edging books, circulation desk, sorting/scanning books in and out of library  inventory and organizing books according to genre for shelving.       During 2017- 2018, we had four new community-based learning sites (worksites)/ internship sites such as Brooklyn  Hospital (Full-time for our Project Search program), Marshalls on 86th Street, Heights and Hills Senior Center in Park  Slope, and with the National Park Service at Floyd Bennett Field (mentioned above). . For school year 2017-18, we had  fourty-five new students at our Full-time and part-time worksites including three wheelchair-bound students and 6  students from our 12:1:4 program. To date, we have 8 Full time Community-based learning sites (worksites/internship  sites) located at Brooklyn College, Seagate Nursing Home, VA Hospital in Brooklyn, Maimonides and Boro Park Center,  St. Joachim and St. Anne Nursing Home, Coney Island Hospital, Haym Salomon Nursing Home, and the new site at  Brooklyn Hospital. We have 14 part-time community-based learning worksites/internship sites that include Grimaldi's  Pizza, Kings Bay Y in Nostrand, Marshalls 86th Street, Seven Eleven, Williamsburg Cinemas, Amico Senior Center, GAP  Store, Floyd Bennett Field Brooklyn College at Ingersoll Hall, Salt and Sea Mission, etc.       Furthermore, we identified specific internship sites for the English Language Learners (ELL) to receive English as a New  Language (ENL) services hours at a vocational setting. The Maimonides/BoroPark Center (12:1:1 ELLs), Williamsburg  Movie Theater (12:1:4 ELLs and 6:1:1 ELLs) and GAP (12:1:1 Bilingual Yiddish students). Six classes of 12:1:1 ELLs  receive Vocational training in-school at the school's Bakeshop class taught by the ENL teacher.       Student Clubs   Every Friday during period 7 homeroom teachers offered a variety of clubs to students. Students filled out a  preference sheet which allowed them to advocate for themselves and exercise their student choice. Students  participated in a wide range of clubs every Friday during period 7. This allowed for great socialization opportunities to  occur in the natural environment. Students went to a different classroom and participated in an activity of interest to  them. As the year progressed, students were given the opportunity to try alternate clubs in order to find additional  areas of interest.       Sustainability   Recipient of Recycling grant offered by the New York City Department of Education Office of Sustainability. Our high  school received over 200 blue and green recycling bins for every office and classroom. The recycling program is   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16      student led and run. Our 6:1:1 classes set up and placed stickers on bins and walls for classroom use, while our 12:1:1  students collected recyclables once per week from the classrooms. Both our K-2 and our high school sites worked  with Zero Waste Coordinators to continue to improve sustainable practices.    Additionally, we hosted annual Garden to Café events, sponsored by School Foods, which showcased seed to table  practices and exposed students to healthy eating habits by teaching students to prepare recipes from crops harvested  in the garden. Partnering with Grow to Learn will allow our students to access the garden, using attainable  instructional goals for students who have cognitive impairments and physical limitations. Through our school garden,  we are registered with multiple organizations who provide resources to continue our garden program, such as Grow  NYC, Garden to Café, Grow to Learn, New York Restoration Project, National Wildlife Federation, Green Thumb and  New York City Department of Sanitation. During the 2017 – 2018 school year, we received a large donation of  compost from the NYC DSNY, and became certified as a native species habitat by the National Wildlife Federation for  our pollinator garden.          Teacher Teams    Systems for Improvement   Teacher Teams and Leadership Development   Having high expectations for all students and challenging each student to achieve his/her highest potential towards  reaching independence define instructional expectations at P721K. Teachers provided the support needed to achieve  these goals using a curriculum that is standards-based, aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS),  Career Development and Occupational Studies (CDOS) that are all supported by Universal Design for Learning.  Teachers are provided with uniform curricula that are implemented throughout our school.    The establishment of Professional Learning Committees (PLC), composed of teachers and related service providers,  helpd to build a collaborative environment. Teachers are grouped according to staff to student ratio and/or content  area. PLC’s, otherwise known as “Quads”, are inclusive of multiple stakeholders and foster collaborative relationships  between teachers and related service providers that better serve our students. Administrators attend PLC meetings  and establish group norms, expectations, roles and the overall goals of the team. “Quads” address the factors of age- grouping, planning of corresponding rigorous academic activities, and utilization of Curricula that are available for  students with special needs (Unique, Attainment Transition, EFL and Equals). Quads align assessments to curricula,  use ongoing assessment and grading practices, and analyze data to inform instruction continuously throughout the  school year. All teachers are expected to document student progress via ongoing data collection, which includes, but  is not limited to, Student Annual Needs Determination Inventory (SANDI), SANDI/FAST, Unique Learning Systems,  Attainment, ABLLS, Essential for Living, IEP, STEM Scopes, data collection, teacher-made assessments, NYSAA, videos  and photos. Teams of teachers will also analyze curricula Attainment Transition, and resources IEP, Get Ready to  Learn (GRTL), Work-based Learning (worksite) or Internship sites) that are available for this school year. Analysis of  curricula addressed the needs of the students in the areas of Math, Reading, Writing, Communication, and as a pilot  initiative in the area of Vocational skills. A team of worksite/internship teachers was formed to conduct self-audit of  SSP13 and to regularly to look at addressing the needs of students that are in worksites or internship settings. This  allowed teachers to be reflective and to improve pedagogy, as well as help students achieve success in a meaningful,  data driven way.

Teacher leaders work with administrators and  PLCs to compile data using scores from school wide alternate assessments such as New York State Alternate  Assessment (NYSAA), New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT), Student Annual  Needs Determination Inventory (SANDI), as well as curricular assessments such as Attainment and Equals. The  assessments and curricula provide an emphasis on connecting standards to content, as well as vocational and daily  living skills, which equips students with the skills and knowledge they need to be successful and active members of  their communities.       During the 2018 – 2019 school year, we will have two model teachers who will showcase their professional and  pedagogical practices through intervisitations within their own classrooms, as well as their colleagues’ classrooms,  followed by debriefs. Through intervisitations and reflections of their pedagogical practice, model teachers will foster  a collaborative environment among pedagogical staff that supports our instructional goals of improving student  content acquisition as it is aligned to the Danielson Framework and the Common Core State Standards, Reading for  Information (RI.10) and Operations and Algebra (OA). Additionally, our model teachers will support pedagogical  growth through coaching teachers in the Applied Behavior Analysis principals that guide the teaching protocols used  in our Essential for Living curriculum, within our 6:1:1 classrooms.       Departmentalization for All Students: Teachers are becoming masters in subject areas and providing direct instruction  to a larger group of students. This allows teachers to hone their skills in targeted areas and make progress in their  delivery of instruction by becoming "experts" in a curriculum or subject area. They then are able to share this with a  larger group of students.      NYS Assessment and NYC IEP Data Highlights    For the 2018-2019 school year, P721K has offered the following for the Least Restrictive Environment:     PB site (Ten students have moved to the 3rd grade, one student moved to 12:1:1 standardized and three   students moved from 6:1:1 to 8:1:1)     High School site (Five students have moved from 12:1:4 to 12:1:1, six students have moved from 6:1:1 to   8:1:1, and four have moved from 8:1:1 to 12:1:1). Fourteen students moved to a less restrictive environment  for the 2017-2018 school year (14-21 year age range)    SSP 13 - 2 IEPs were pulled for review from our school and passed the review    District 75 IEP reviews: As a school, we conducted 4 cycles of IEP reviews by reviewing 2 IEPs for each cycle:  Multidisciplinary team made up of the Administration, Teachers, Related Service Providers, Parents, and Students,  participated in these reviews.

FAST  data was used by teachers to inform instructional grouping and practices, as student performance was assessed in  targeted standards (ELA and Math) and skill areas . SANDI/FAST team members participated in district trainings to  learn how to use the FAST system and present the resources during in house PDs to our teachers. In house PDs were  conducted in the Fall and Spring to ensure teachers were familiar with FAST assessment procedures, resources, and  expectations for administering the benchmark assessments.      After the Benchmark 1 assessment period, SANDI/FAST and Data team members analyzed student data to determine  school wide trends, identify areas of strength, and created an action plan to target areas in need for improvement.  The SANDI/FAST and Data team disseminated this information to teachers on data sheets for planning within the PLCs  during common planning times. Teachers recorded individual student data to monitor student progress between the  assessment periods. During FAST PDs, the presentations focused on exploring best practices to use FAST data to  inform data-driven instruction. Teachers worked to unpack FAST data for analysis and reflection, to create  instructional groups and gather data for student progress within the class, PLC, to ensure overall school-wide  improvement for students.        Data Sources     Prior Years CEP Data      Instructional Focus: Where Are You Going?

SANDI Instructional Kits for Level One Students   The use of SANDI kits for Level 1 students will ensure that engaging and rigorous curricula, that is aligned to the  common core is, accessible for students of all cognitive abilities. Our level one students need the highest quality of  academic support in order to remain engaged in challenging tasks and demonstrate higher-order thinking skills. These  students will receive manipulatives to provide accessibility to rigorous curricula and academic tasks.      Don Johnson's Readtopia Curriculum   721K has selected 9 teachers to participate in the New York City Readtopia Curriculum Pilot. The purpose of the pilot  is to collect data that demonstrates reading outcomes for all students. All 9 teachers attended professional  development training in August 2018 in order to unpack the curriculum and prepare for a September 2018 start. Four  units of study will be directly taught to students using the Readtopia curriculum resources. Student Progress will be  monitored and reported back to Readtopia.

The purpose of the project was to  develop a strong foundation in building an alternate assessment of English language proficiency for English learners  with significant cognitive disabilities. ALTELLA members observed ENL and TBE teachers to learn what techniques and  activities are used with their learners.    We have developed a 25 member ELL Team that will learn and start to implement the 4 Hallmarks of an ELL  classrooms using the Advanced Literacy's from the Next Generation Learning Standards. The school development the  framework to continuing improve and learn across all disciplines. The ELL Team will work through the school year  using Cycles of Learning with targeted instructional strategies.       Pre-ETS   We will focus on using Attainment's Pre-Employment Transition Solution (Pre-ETS) to track progress towards IEP  goals, as well as part of our ELA curriculum. This will serve as a resource for teachers to use for teaching strategies and  scaffolds for students in vocabulary instruction/ leveled instruction. The assessment manual provides formative and  summative assessments, as well as self-assessments for students. An Assistive Technology (AT) profile book is  included and is meant to travel with students to determine the effectiveness of AT across multiple settings, and to  help inform IEP goals. The Pre-ETS also comes with an iPad app, that allows teachers to upload data tracking forms  and digitize them for use on the iPad. This app can be used by classroom staff, as well as teachers to integrate  assessment into instructional practice to monitor progress, and track individual student learning outcomes.       Arts Programming   School Culture   High Expectations and Positive Learning Environment     P721K has received the 2018 - 2019 Arts for ELLs and Students with Disabilities Grant Program. This grant will   boost our ability to increase students Arts achievement while targeting the needs of diverse learners,  including students with disabilities and English Language Learners through the Everyday Arts for Special  Education (EASE) Program. EASE is an evidenced based arts-integration methodology designed to improve  student achievement in the areas of communication, socialization, academic learning and arts proficiency. We  anticipate having 12-ELL and 28-SWD students receiving 32 hours each of EASE instruction.     During the 2018 -2019 school year, we plan to continue our Art’s Partnership with the MET, which has   expanded from two to five classes.      Art’s Monday Facilitator’s Institute, which is facilitated by our art teacher Ms. Keller, will continue to serve as   after school professional development and will be ongoing from October 2018 to May 2019.      Continuation of the Marquis Studios laser painting instruction for twelve students.      Spotlight students talent in the school community, including student-run Open Mic (ukulele), Flash Mob,  student created murals throughout the school building.

During the 2018 – 2019 school year we will have two Model Teachers who will work  with administrators and PLCs to compile data using scores from school wide alternate assessments such as New York  State Alternate Assessment (NYSAA), New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSELAT),  Student Annual Needs Determination Inventory (SANDI), as well as curricular assessments such as Attainment and  Equals. Teacher leaders will look at school wide data to determine problems of practice and areas for instructional  focus that are both long term and short term. They will present data to teacher teams, as well as provide them with  resources to address the area of focus. Additionally, we plan to develop teacher leaders, who have expertise in  specific content areas, into coaches, in order to support our instructional goals.       During the 2018 – 2019 school year, we will have two model teachers who will showcase their professional and  pedagogical practices through intervisitations within their own classrooms, as well as their colleagues’ classrooms,  followed by debriefs. Through intervisitations and reflections of their pedagogical practice, model teachers will foster  a collaborative environment among pedagogical staff that supports our instructional goals of improving student  content acquisition as it is aligned to the Danielson Framework and the Common Core State Standards, Reading for  Information (RI.10) and Operations and Algebra (OA). Additionally, our model teachers will support pedagogical  growth through coaching teachers in the Applied Behavior Analysis principals that guide the teaching protocols used  in our Essential for Living curriculum, within our 6:1:1 classrooms.       Teacher Teams - Learning Partners Program (LPP)   During the 2018 – 2019 school year, we plan to participate in LPP, specifically for our new ENL classes. P721K was  selected as a host school for LPP. We will work collaboratively with other schools, to share best practices and gain  insight into current ENL instructional programming through on-going cycles of learning, in order to ensure that  academic tasks are rigorous and coherent across grades and instructional tracks. Currently we are waiting to be paired  with partner schools who have the same area of focus as us. If this does not come to fruition for the 2018-2019 school  year the Learning Partners Program guaranteed participation as host school for the following school year.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          24         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 75K721   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   10,11,12,SE   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   479   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     After in-depth data inquiry of the 2017-2018 relevant data inclusive of the following:  NYS report card,  NYC DOE  weekly RS program/compliance reports, 2015 Quality Review, as well as school level instructional data including  SANDI, FAST, GRTL, EFL Essential Eight Assessment, ABLLS, Unique, and Attainment, it is evident that we need to  differentiate how we assess our varying levels of learners. Data aligned with rigorous instruction from SANDI,  NYSAA,  Performance Series,  ABBLS-R,  EFL, School Quality Snapshot, Quality Review data were evaluated. According to an  item analysis of the 2018 FAST benchmark assessment and the 2017 SANDI assessment, school wide score trends in  common core state standard, Operations and Algebra (OA), item 4, showed an overall decline in scores from  benchmark 1 -2, and item 2, which showed overall score stagnation between benchmarks 1 and 2. Specific skills  required for these items include counting using a number line, recognition of numeral to item quantities, using  mathematical terms and symbols, item to numeral correspondence and one to one correspondence, as well is  interpreting number lines and pictographs. These skills will be embedded across curricula, including Equals, Unique,  STEMscopes, and Attainment to increase content knowledge in OA and improve student scores on OA FAST, items 2  and 4. Pedagogical staff will attend PD Fridays regularly, where they will receive resources on how to align  instructional foci under OA to their lesson activities, as well as tools for monitoring student progress. Teachers in our  9 - 12 classrooms will use the Equals curriculum assessment, as well as the SANDI assessment to determine specific  IEP goals in this content area and to be used as ongoing assessments which will track student content acquisition for  instructional foci under OA. Teachers in our K - 2 classrooms will use ABLS and GoMath as ongoing assessments to  track student progress in the instructional foci under OA.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  While reviewing various growth data points for our students; though progress is noted we continue to provide  learning opportunities for self-advocacy and social emotional skills. Our students participate in a variety of Arts  Programming including: MET Partnership, World Theatre Project Partnership, New Victory Theatre partnership and  school-wide theatrical performances. Through our Met partnership we were able to involve our students in the Self  Control, Communication, Navigation and Advocacy (SCANA) program to develop student social emotional skills and  awareness. Through various aspects of our theatre and museum partnerships, our students gained valuable social  emotional skill sets through viewing art and participating in community theatres and museums. Student success was  measured by a rubric of observable outcomes for museum and theatre visits. During the 2017 – 2018 school year a  total of 255 students participated in a variety of arts programming including 150 students attended Broadway shows,  15 students participated in the D75 Festival of the Arts and P.S. Art contest, 175 students participated in three school- wide performances, and 12 students received and learned to play the ukulele. Our goal for the 2018 – 2019 is to  increase the number of students participating in arts programming, to intellectually engage students through art  activities, and teach social emotional skills through the arts.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   As a school that emphasizes career and post-secondary options and to ensure rigorous instruction for all students, we  found the need for a more defined curriculum plan and overall review of our growth development as a school and as  the many departments that comprise of the school community. After in-depth data inquiry of the 2017-2018 relevant  data inclusive of the following: NYS report card, NYC DOE weekly RS program/compliance reports, 2015 Quality  Review, as well as school level instructional data including SANDI, FAST, GRTL, EFL Essential Eight Assessment, ABLLS,  Unique, and Attainment, it is evident that we need to differentiate how we assess our varying levels of learners. Data  aligned with rigorous instruction from SANDI, NYSAA, Performance Series, ABBLS-R, EFL, School Quality Snapshot,  Quality Review data were evaluated. According to the 2015 Quality Review, our area of focus, according to indicator  2.2, is to align assessments to curricula, use on-going assessment and grading practices, and analyze student learning  outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at team and classroom levels. We know that if there is greater alignment  between assessment and instructional tasks, there is a greater impact on student achievement. During the 2017-2018  school year, we analyzed data from SANDI/FAST to allow for targeted instruction and ongoing assessment based on  current benchmark scores, as well as measuring growth between the Fall 2016 and the Fall 2017 SANDI assessment  scores. In order to address QR indicator 2.2, teachers will be provided templates that mirror the common core aligned  assessments to teach students skills necessary to take the exams, as well as improve ongoing assessment. Teachers  can insert specific content into templates, based on the learner centered problem. According to an item analysis of  the 2017 – 2018 FAST Benchmark scores in ELA, school wide scores showed an overall regression of scores in Reading  for Information 10 (RI.10), cutting textual evidence to support analysis of text and draw inferences based on the text.  Further item analysis of the FAST Benchmark scores showed school wide score stagnation in RI.10, item 6. The specific  content on the assessment, are indicated as areas of need. Therefore, an instructional focus on matching with  association, word families, patterns in text and rhyming, using departmentalized ELA periods and instructional  strategies of Thinking Maps, Readtopia, Unique, and ongoing classroom assessments that mirror the FAST  assessment. Additional instructional supports will include the use of Pre-ETS, Kneoworld, Readtopia ninety minutes of  literacy instruction, and SANDI kits, to enhance and increase student engagement across grades and classroom  settings. During the 2017 – 2018 school year, we connected SANDI and FAST through the use of Performance Item by  Level (PIL) charts to identify current IEP goals to prioritize learning needs, and develop instructional groups, using data  from summative and formative assessments, to ensure student grouping by academic level, specific to the content  area. Teachers will continue to use the PIL charts to inform instructional grouping during the 2018 – 2019 school year.  Additionally, we will use the Pre-ETS program as a digitized way of tracking IEP goals in specific content areas, as well  as progress monitoring of content knowledge acquisition. Additionally, the Readtopia pilot is inclusive of a data  tracking system that teachers will have to digitize and utilize for the company in order to monitor the progress of this  specific intervention.

The EDUR 2017 - 2018, showed that 93.5% of  of our ELLs receiving ENL services are in STARS. Our school has programmed 100% of our former ELLS for ENL in  STARS. Our school has home language codes for 100% of our students. We have 100% compliance on Parent choice of  ELL program. We were able to identify SIFE status for 100% of the students that require a status update. We have  administered the New York State Identification Test for English Language Learners (NYSITELL) to 100% of the eligible  students.    2. There are 474 students in our school organization, 163 are English Language Learner (ELL) students which is 32.5%  of our student population. One hundred sixty three (163) of our current ELLs participated in the NYSESLAT 2018.  Currently, three (3) students are at Expanding level, five (5) students at Transitioning level, forty three (43) students at  Emerging level, and eighty nine (89) of the students at Entering level. There are twenty three (23) students did not  receive NYSESLAT results due to (10) new in entrants to New York City schools and (13) students either not tested or  the score did not translate into the system   Based on 2017 NYSESLAT data out of 137 test takers, 20 test takers advanced to 1 proficiency level, 2 test takers  advanced to two proficiency levels and 83 of the test takers remained at same proficiency level and 13 test takers  regressed 1 proficiency level. In comparison, on 2016 NYSESLAT data out of 147 test takers, 52 test takers advanced to  1 proficiency level, 3 test takers advanced to two proficiency levels and 47 of the test takers remained at same  proficiency level and only 1 test taker regressed 1 proficiency level. Based on these two year results, the priority need  of the school is to strengthen classroom instruction in the hope that strong instruction will equate to progressive test  scores.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, school leaders will create and implement a professional development plan that builds teachers' capacity  to provide rigorous instruction aligned with the Four Hallmarks of Advanced Literacies for English Language Learners  (ELL) as evidenced by a 5% increase in the ELL's English Language Proficiency Level based on 2019 New York State  English as a Second Language Achievement Test.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Include  the  timeline and identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight.  To start off the school year, the ELL Kick off event is scheduled on September 25, 2018 where ELL families are invited  to provide ELL information and school services. Additionally, our school offers parent workshops based upon their  feedback from a Needs Assessment Survey. For the Families of students in Quad 3 the families will be part of the  cycles of learning. As this goal is for greater discussion the students primary mode of communication needs to be used  at home as well as in school. We will engage with families using face to face meetings, provide parental meetings,  videos, and web casting.         Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment  Part 4a.

Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress.  We will use the Cycles of Learning (CoL) documentation tool. The tool's primary purpose is for our team to  memorialize our Cycles of Learning to guide us through the inquiry process. This allows our school to have flexibility in  determining the resources and approaches that they we will use to advance our inquiry work as well as the number of  Cycles that we are engage in. This work is non-evaluative so we encourage our team to include all information learned  through this inquiry process, including instances where the results are not what was expected.     Part 5c.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   1. To increase daily communication with families, our school has a developed website that supports teachers,  students, and families about ongoing events, school trips, programs, parent training, curricula, homework, and  instruction. According to the 2016 – 2017 School Quality Snapshot, 97% of parents feel that the principal works to  create a sense of community in the school. To continue to create strong family and school community ties, we used  the Remind App for the 2017-2018 school year. This allowed the administration, teachers, and parents to connect  using text messages. Teachers can create their own "classes" where they share messages for students and parents.  The administration also has access to send out school wide messages to students and families, about important  updates. The school monthly calendar can be shared to our community at large. According to the 2016 – 2017 School  Survey Snap Shot, 98% of parents say that school building staff works to build trust and establish relationships with  family. Using the Remind app, parents can send messages to teachers or administrators without having to call the  school. The app creates a sense of privacy but also transparency for families and the school community and we plan  to continue using it in the 2018 – 2019 school year.    2. During school year 2017 - 2018, P721K worked in concentrated teams to develop plans to strengthen our  communication and enhance the level of involvement between our students’ instructional activities and the  awareness/ involvement of their families. Key areas of development were based on the Learning Environment Survey  (LES) participation, sharing opportunities about student instructional continuum within our school and parental  engagement with school-based committees. The LES parents' participation rate in 2014 was 23%, 2015 was 24% and  2016 was 29% and 2017 was 34%. The participation rate grew overall from 2014 to 2017 by 11%, and from 2016 –  2017, with an average growth of 3% per year. Our goal is to continue to increase parental participation on the school  quality snapshot survey. Additionally, we hope to increase the number of parents who participate in school social  events and who come on school/class trips. To increase family participation, a school social event will be held for  students and families once per month.    The 2017 School Quality Snapshot indicates that 96% of parents believe that the school offers activities and services  to improve life outcomes for students. In September of 2019 we are holding two orientations, one K-2 and one for the  high school, as well as a safety town hall which will take place after the orientation. During the 2018 – 2019 school  year we plan to hold monthly parent outreach PD's on various topics that are aligned to improving life outcomes for  students including curriculum (Kneo World), guardianship, Front Door training, CPR training, Internship Fair, healthy  tasting and sipping habits event, fostering communication during mealtime, and a transition fair. PD's will be held  during the day as well as during the evening to accommodate parents' schedules. The sign in process for parent  training and family social events will be digitized using the application Certain Arrive. Parents will sign in on an iPad,  which will collect data on which parents attended and how many came to specific events. This will allow us to further  tailor our events towards parents needs and track data on the number of attendees. Additionally, we will hold  monthly social events including an Art show, a theatre performance, a Moving-Up ceremony, a family day, a family  attendance social, and graduation. Social events will be communicated using the Remind app, as well as through  printed flyers that are double sided, English and language spoken in the home. The flyers will be translated into seven  languages including Arabic, Spanish, Bengali, Urdu, Mandarin, Haitian Creole and Russian. Through multiple avenues  of communication, and through translating messages sent home, we plan to significantly increase the number of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      family members who attend school training and social events, as well as increase the participation rate on the NYC  School Survey.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)                                 Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   0    0   0     0     0      1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53       Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 721, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 721 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Disabilities include intellectual disabilities, autism, multiple disabilities,  speech impairment, and other health impairments. There are 474 students in our school  organization, 163 are English Language Learner(ELL) students (33% of our student  population).  We have 6 transitional bilingual education (TBE) classes namely:  one  12:1:1 (Yiddish) class, 3 Spanish classes (two Spanish HS 12:1:1 ,  12:1:4 and one 6:1:1 K- 2),  two  Mandarin classes (12:1: HS and 6:1:1 K-2) and ENL Stand Alone / Integrated ENL  programs at P721K. The remaining bilingual mandated students have alternate placement  paraprofessionals who speak the students’ native languages and English, and receive the  services from a certified ENL teachers in class ratios of 12:1:4, 12:1:1. 6:1:1, and 8:1:1. The  languages of the alternate placement paraprofessional are: Arabic, Cantonese, Haitian Creole,  Hebrew, Mandarin, Russian, Spanish, Urdu, and Yiddish. One hundred sixty three (163) of our  current ELLs participated in the NYSESLAT 2018.   Currently, three (3) students are at  Expanding level, five (5) students at Transitioning level, forty three (43) students at Emerging  level, and eighty nine (89) of the students at Entering level.  There are twenty three (23) students  did not receive NYSESLAT results due to (10) new in entrants to New York City schools and  (13) students either not tested or the score did not translate into the system.  The 30 students who will be invited to participate in the Title lll program have limited verbal  expression and need practice in reading and writing, as well as in improving their listening and  speaking skills, as is evident by their NYSESLAT scores and class work. This supplemental  instructional program will assist them in improving their overall English proficiency in speaking,  writing, reading and listening skills.    Planned Instructional Practices: Instruction for all ELLs at 721K is aligned to the NYS New  Language Arts Progression (NLAP), NYS  Common Core Learning Standards ( as we transition  to using the New York State Next Generation Learning Standards) as well as the New York State  Alternate Assessment (NYSAA). ELLs who are in our bilingual classes receive instruction that  targets the NYS Home Language Arts Progression (HLAP). For School year 2018 - 2019, on  staff are 6 Bilingual Special Education teachers ( 1 - Yiddish 3 - Spanish and 2  Mandarin) and 5  ENL teachers are NYS certified.  The school also have 3 Bilingual Speech teachers in Spanish,  Yiddish and Mandarin language. A parent coordinator who is Bilingual Spanish has  shown success with students' parents/guardians outreach especially to our Spanish speaking  families. Bilingual and ENL teachers address students’ second language acquisition needs by  providing students with instruction that is: differentiated, respects and supports students’ learning  styles, preferred mode of communication  and culture. Teachers use effective ENL  methodologies such as the Natural Approach, the Language Experience Approach and Total  Physical Response (TPR), scaffolding instruction, and fading cues and prompts, when  appropriate, to encourage and reinforce students’ independence and choice-making abilities.  Teachers utilize cooperative learning techniques in order to facilitate communication among  students and improve their use of language. Technology is an important aspect of the learning  process that enables students who have difficulty in writing to express themselves or motivate   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   involvement as to have access. It also allows them to have their language in written form in order  to document the progress of the acquisition of the English Language.     P721K Title lll after school language instruction program for English Language Learners is a  supplemental program that will begin early October 2018 and run through January  2019. This  instructional program is titled "Swinging into Title III: America's Most Loved Sport and Roy  Campanella".  It will be held twice a week on Tuesdays (9) and Thursdays (11) from 3:00 pm- 5:00 pm. English will be the language of instruction. The focus of this program is to support  students’ acquisition with accommodation if needed for listening, speaking, reading, and writing  skills in English while integrating an understanding and history of a popular American sport -  baseball. The study will include learning the rules of the baseball game, the roles of the players,  how scoring is done and the value of sportsmanship. The Literacy component will focus on  learning and understanding of sports related idioms and expressions.  We will also learn about  the life, struggles and triumphs of Roy Campanella, a famous baseball player and in whose  honor our school is named for.  It is vital that continuing attention to the use of English language  is provided for the students to make them more aware of how language functions and helps them  control and use it in effective ways. The National Council of Teachers in 2015 states that English  language is basic to learning in all disciplines and skillful use of language may be the most  important means of realizing the overarching goal of education to develop informed, thinking  students.   This statement strengthened our decision to guide and mold students to progress and  develop in the usage of the English language to achieve academic success. Opportunities for  students to use and improve listening, speaking, reading and writing in English are provided  through the enrichment of the afterschool program as students take part in a baseball tournament  and they attend a mini league game as per the focus of the Title III theme . The Scope and  Sequence of the program is literacy based, focusing on reading, writing about baseball and  focusing on idioms and expressions that have figurative meaning.   Instruction is in English using  ENL methodologies and native language support to reinforce reading and writing concepts and  skills with the assistance of bilingual paraprofessionals. Students will engage in activities/tasks,  using the ipad and apps for writing and reading about the life of Roy Campanella and baseball  games,as well as reading through books  related to the topic and generating original writing  pieces  that will provide opportunities to improve their  communication skills in English as they  share their work with peers.  The Title III program will service 30 students:  6 students in 6:1:1, grades K-2 and 24 HS  students in 12:1:1, grades 9 - 12 . There will be six paraprofessionals whose languages are the  home language of the students attending , as well as English.  Three(3) paraprofessionals will be  placed as classroom paraprofessionals, the additional 3 paraprofessional lines are to support the  need of Crisis Management Paraprofessionals (CMP) or Health Paraprofessionals  (HP)  for the  students that will be attending.  There will be 3 classes and each class will work with a Bilingual  or ENL NYS certified teacher. Students will engage in baseball themed activities using the  computer, ipad, digital cameras, graphic organizers, books and CDs and baseball equipments.  The curriculum will cover identification of  the rules in baseball, keeping scores, sportsmanship,  reading biographies and interpreting sports related idioms.  In addition, teachers will create  assignments in the NYSESLAT format(e.g., Telling a story from picture, pre-writing/writing).  The lessons will enrich and support instruction provided during the school day by offering  students opportunities to practice, reinforce, and generalize their English language skills while  engaging in motivating activities. Tasks performed by students during this Title lll after school  instructional program will be aligned to the NYS CCLS,NYS-NLAP, NYSAA and the NYS  Next Generation Learning Standards as they replace the CCLS. Students will be participating in  a baseball game amongst themselves and will view a mini- league game to understand how  the Baseball is played.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   This year we plan to invite our Adaptive Physical Education Teacher to be our trainer  for a  Professional Development sessions. This professional development will provide additional  knowledge of strategies and the mechanics of the game. We also plan to invite a Sportscaster to  model and discuss how games are broadcast and the idioms they used in the sport.  Teacher-generated assessments, NYSAA ELA scores, and NYSESLAT 2018 scores will be used  to identify students’ progress along the language-learning continuum. Students will have  to complete an evaluation form at the end of the Title lll program.  There will be a school administrator in the building to supervise the program. The program  allocated 2 hours per session for the secretary to support in setting up transportation for the  students participating in the program.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  P721K uses the scores of the NYSESLAT each year to assess the literacy skills, specifically of the English Language Learners  (ELL). Based on their scores, students are classified according to their English language proficiency levels and are supported  respectfully according to their levels. Furthermore, P721K uses the SANDI (Students Annual Needs Determination Inventory)  assessment for all students.  SANDI is administered to students across 4 domains- reading, writing, math, and communication  in both the fall and spring semesters. SANDI results are then used to drive the creation of IEP goals for each student. Students’  IEP goals are routinely monitored throughout the year by data collection. The two summative assessment (NYSESLAT and  SANDI) data results are used as baseline to determine students' level and correlates with the use of the curriculum for core  subject areas.   P721K utilizes the Unique Curriculum with monthly themes that provide pre- and post- tests, as well as formative assessments   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      through questions and answers for each lesson. School-wide assessment rubrics allow teachers to level and track student  ability and progress during various tasks and activities. In addition, informal teacher-made assessments such as checklists,  rubrics, and exit slips are also used during classroom instruction to continually measure student progress and growth.   This data provides insight into the English proficiency and functioning levels of our ELLs.  It allows our teachers to address  students’ individual needs at their level. This data drives the differentiation of instruction and instructional plans by aiding  teachers in making the content and output accessible for our students.          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?    The "Unique" curriculum assessments, checklists, rubrics, and other types of data collection provide our teachers with  effective tools of measuring, evaluating and making adjustments to the programs for each student.To support these  efforts,  there is a cycle of Professional Learning meeting once a week dedicated to Data Analysis, Curriculum and Assessment,  Individualized Education Program (IEP) inquiry and Curriculum Development on a rotating basis.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   SANDI assessment  is administered to our students across four domains : reading, writing, math, and communication in the  beginning and at the end of each school year. The results indicate the areas of  students' strength and weaknesses to be  reflected in the IEP goals. The success of our programs for ELLs is based predominantly upon formative assessments,  evaluations , and data collections by teachers. These include teacher observations, teacher-made assessments, rubrics, and  checklists, in addition to the use of the school-wide rubrics. The success of our ELLs  is also evaluated through progress  monitoring of students' annual IEP goals, which occurs three times per school year (November, March, and June). Annual  NYSESLAT scores are also reflective of student progress within the individual domains of reading, writing, speaking, and  listening and across the hierarchy of English proficiency levels. Get Ready To Learn (GRTL) is a yoga program that prepares  students to face cognitive challenges associated with learning and retaining new information. Embedded in the program is a  baseline assessment which is administered in October in which teachers record student behaviors that interfere with learning.  In May, teachers update baseline reports to reflect student progress in the identified behaviors. Overall, the data will show the  increase of positive behavior and the decrease of  behaviors that interfere with learning. additionally, embedded in the  program is a weekly assessment of individual student time on task, self-regulation, attention and communication skills in the  30 minutes following the GRTL program. ideally, there should be an increase of these skills throughout the year.  Student progress and successes within all of these evaluations therefore reflect progress and success across our ELL  programs.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The administrators, ENL and TBE teachers meet together to analyze the results of SANDI, NYSAA, and NYSESLAT scores to  group the ENL and bilingual students according to their language proficiency level and instructional ratios. Based on the  NYSESLAT performance, the class lists and schedules are created prior to the start of the school year, according to the  mandates for the number of instructional minutes ENL and Native Language service.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    The Response to Intervention (RTI) model is  a state-mandated general education instructional program model that aims at  prevention and early intervention through tiered system of instructional support by adding augmented levels of instruction al  support to the standard core curriculum.    The school determines additional support services for grades K- 2 students who score below specified levels of performance  on the annual English language proficiency assessments.  During the year, students were provided Theater class that afforded  the students opportunity to perform and express themselves through facial, gestural and bodily expressions and movements .  The program was allocated in the students schedule  for two periods per week. Additionally, students were provided with the  time to access the library during their lunch time. This activity is called  Open Library Time. It provides our  high school  students with the opportunity to participate in Read-aloud  activities and discussions. The students in classes  K-2   select   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71         their  books   and use them as educational applications to improve their letter recognition and reading skills.            6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data patterns of the 2017 NYSITELL and NYSESLAT reveal that a majority of our students, grades 9-12, perform at the  Entering level of English language proficiency, and require 540 minutes of ENL services each week. The NYSESLAT 2017 data  analysis also revealed that the students demonstrated significant progress in English language proficiency compared to the  results of Spring 2016 .  The number of the students performing at the Emerging Level of English language  proficiency  increased  from  2  to 49 which is 32% of the total number of  ELLs tested.  In the Transition Proficiency level, there  was an increase from 1 student to 3 students . The Expanding Proficiency  Level was attained by 9 students, who were tested  during the NYSESLAT 2017.  Due to our students’ developmental disabilities and based on previous years’ NYSESLAT scores,  our ELLs are typically classified as long-term ELLs meaning to say that they need continued support in ENL services throughout  the duration of their academic career.      At the beginning of the school year, students are assessed using the Students Annual Needs Determination Inventory (SANDI)  Assessment that will generate students' level based on the assessed skills in the areas of Reading, Writing, Communication,  Vocational and Math.  Using the SANDI results and the NYSESLAT data, the teacher will be able to target annual goals that will be basis in the creation  of the students' instructional activities.  Furthermore, the school uses the data yielded through the use of EDAT to focus on the progress toward achievement of  proficiency for specific subgroups of ELLs, and to effectively design instructional programs for students, The factors that can be  analyzed include home language, grade level, years of ELL service, ELA/Math performance and progress, NYSESLAT proficiency  and progress, attendance, age, credit accumulation, holdover status, SIFE status, and disability classification. Using the  EDAT,  allows the school to eliminate the need for hand calculations which are time-consuming and error-prone, provides an  electronic document that allows us to instantly filter data and create targeted groups that helps to measure progress toward  the goal of English proficiency. The tool allows us to identify trends or pockets of success which we use to investigate  instructional and programmatic differences between groups of students who consistently progress towards proficiency and  whose who do not.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Official teachers of ELLs are provided with the NYSESLAT results at the beginning of the school year. Together with the ENL or  TBE teachers, they develop annual goals that correspond with the needs identified from the NYSESLAT testing results and from  the SANDI pre-assessment data.  During the IEP meeting, the long term and short term goals are discussed with the parents  together with the school team to communicate a common understanding and to plan on how to address the identified needs  both at home and in school.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Freestanding English as a new language (ENL) programs provide instruction in English with home language support,  emphasizing English language acquisition. Home language supports for students are provided through the provision of  alternate placement paraprofessional as identified in the students' IEP. Students in freestanding ENL programs can   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72         come from many different language backgrounds, and English may be the only common language among the  students. As per CR Part 154, there are two types of ENL that P721K follows, the Stand-alone ENL and  Integrated ENL.  All ELLs are identified and grouped ungraded (all students regardless of grade are in one class) within 3 level  grades.  ELLs are also grouped by block (class travel together as a group) and are heterogeneous (mixed proficiency  levels in one class ).             b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Within the 9th-12th grades, 721K has 3 bilingual classes grouped according to IEP ratio mandate, with 3 NYS certified  Bilingual teachers- 2 Yiddish and 1 Spanish. Eleven students are in a Transitional Bilingual Spanish class and a total of  17 students are placed within 2 Transitional Bilingual Yiddish classes. Paraprofessionals who speak the native  languages of the students are assigned to the bilingual classes (Spanish and Yiddish) to provide the student with  additional support. Students in the bilingual Yiddish and Spanish classes remain together as a class for all of their  language services (native language and ENL).They are  grouped by block (class travel together as a group) and are  heterogeneous (mixed proficiency levels in one class ).      Our school will expand the TBE - Spanish program which will be offered to our K-2 6:1:1 students. A new  TBE Mandarin program will be opened for both High school and K - 2 students beginning September 2018.    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      We currently feature ENL and TBE programs.   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Prior to the new school year, the ENL/Bilingual Teachers with the administrator reviews student NYSESLAT and NYSITELL  scores from the previous year. Students are grouped according to proficiency levels and instructional ratios. Master schedules  and class lists are created prior to the start of the school year and are mandated to reflect the matriculation of new students  throughout the school year. Mandates for the number of instructional minutes for Native Language services and ENL are  provided based on the NYSESLAT or NYSITELL results and CR Part 154.1 and 154.2.         FREESTANDING:     Students in grades K - 2 are classified as entering, based on NYSITELL scores (for entering K students) and the most recent  NYSESLAT scores (for Grades 1 - 2 students). Therefore, they receive 2 units of study of ENL in total, per week. One of those  units consists of Stand-Alone ENL (180 minutes) and the other unit consists of Integrated ENL/ELA (180 minutes).      The  ELL students in grades are of 8 through 12, whose NYSESLAT scores classify them as Entering ELLs, are mandated to  receive a total of 3 units (540 minutes) of ENL per week. This mandate consists of one unit (180 minutes) each week of Stand- Alone ENL, one unit (180 minutes) of Integrated ENL/ELA, and 1 unit (180 minutes) of either Stand-Alone ENL or Integrated  ENL/ELA.     TRANSITIONAL BILINGUAL        A total of 14 students participate in the Yiddish bilingual programs. They perform at the Entering level, based on  NYSESLAT scores. They receive instruction in 1 HLA course and a minimum of 2 bilingual content subject areas, and they also  receive minimum of 180 minutes of ENL per week.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73         Students in the bilingual Yiddish class receive HLA and ENL instruction from their teacher who is NYS certified to provide  Bilingual Instruction as well as ENL services. Students in the Bilingual Spanish class receive HLA instruction from a certified  Bilingual Spanish teacher. ENL instruction for this Bilingual Spanish class is provided in a Stand-Alone model by a certified  TESOL teacher.       When looking at the language service mandates, the school takes into consideration the student’s age, time spent in the  country, peer interaction, functioning and communication abilities, needs, desires, future post-graduation placements, etc.  TBE students who transition to an ENL service model will continue to receive the supports as needed. Long term ELLs that  continue to receive language services, as per their IEP and based on their scores on NYSESLAT and NYSITELL, continue to  receive the required amounts of language instruction, as outlined in CR Part 154.1 and 154.2.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   721K provides education to students with intellectual disabilities, Autism, and multiple disabilities, ages 5-7 and 13-21. In  accordance with IEP’s, students are designated Alternate Assessment, therefore are exempt from taking standardized tests to  measure student progress. Students have individualized education plans developed each year, which identify student  strengths and areas needed for improvement. Specific skill-based goals are developed for the year, including language  acquisition (communication, reading, writing, expressive, and receptive language, and subject-specific language).      Our ELLs receive instruction in all  core subject areas- math, science, ELA, and social studies. In addition, they  participate in  adaptive physical education, the arts (music, art, and photography), vocational classes (school-based and community- based).  721K is currently using various curricula for students from  13 to 21 years old, including the Unique Learning System  (high school and transition bands for ELA/Social Studies/Science), Attainment- Life Skills Reader and Vocational Books, and  Equals (math) to drive instruction for all students, including ELLs in TBE and ENL classes. For students 5-8 years old,  curricula include Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills Revised (ABLLS-R), Fundations, Equals Math, Get Ready To  Learn and Passport to Social Studies.      Literacy and communication are important skills which ELL students need to develop and hone if they are to reach their  potential and excel in ENL, bilingual and content area classes in order to meet the demands of the Common Core Learning  Standards and to function as independently as possible in the school environment and in their home communities. These are  major deficit areas for all of our students, including ELLs, and long term ELLs. Among the approaches and  instructional  strategies and interventions for BIS, and TESOL teachers utilize Cognitive Academic Language Approach (CALLA), Total Physical  Response (TPR), Language Experience, Whole Language. The use of graphic organizers and cooperative learning strategies are  also effective in working with our ELL students. The Mayer Johnson communication system is also utilized with ELLs who have  major language communication deficits.     In the TBE classes, the classroom libraries contain books, both in English,  in Spanish, or Yiddish. The school’s library also  contains books in Spanish, Yiddish, and Chinese that all available for all students to access. Multi-sensory and multicultural ESL  materials are infused in instruction. In addition, the TBE teachers also use other instructional aides such as  conversation Cue  Cards, Sentence Starters, word bank (written or picture).     Furthermore, we continue to foster native language support for ELLs in TBE and ENL classes by grouping students who speak  the same language with the support of an alternate placement paraprofessional who is fluent in the native language of the ELL  as per IEP mandate. . These paraprofessionals remain with the student throughout the day. Currently, we have alternate  placement paraprofessionals who serve students in the following languages to foster language development - Haitian Creole,  Russian, Spanish, Chinese/Cantonese/Mandarin, Arabic, Yiddish, Bengali, Urdu, Italian.      In addition, the use of technology in the classroom (classroom computers, computer labs, smart boards, communication  devices, IPADS, and cameras) ELL students can learn in a rich linguistic environment and find opportunities to interact with the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74      multicultural world, so they can extend their language skills, and not be embarrassed for not knowing answers (Padron &  Waxman, 1996 p. 344; Lee, 2000). In other words, it greatly helps to lower ELLs affective filters and  build students’ confidence  at 721K. Therefore, the use of technology is routinely incorporated into ENL, Social Studies and Science as a means to provide  students with additional supports to succeed in all areas.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   All students in our school, including ELLs, participate in  Alternate Assessment according to their IEPs.  ELL students have been  identified and received the services of a bilingual Spanish, Yiddish, or TESOL teachers.  For informal assessments, student work  is collected and evaluated throughout the year. Classroom portfolios are kept for each student in all subject areas. In addition,  teachers use a variety of performance-based assessments throughout the school year to determine student progress in all  subject areas and skills, i.e.: language acquisition, communication, reading, writing, as well as skills in all content areas. If ELL  students are scheduled for triennials during the school year, a bilingual evaluator conducts the evaluation.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    All 4 modalities addressed in the NYSESLAT are skill areas that are considered deficit areas for our students and are addressed  in all program models (TBE and Freestanding ENL). Therefore, the instructions are differentiated to address the individual  needs of ELL students (newcomers, SIFE, and long term)taking into consideration their preferred modes of communication,  learning styles, and ages. Activities and instructional concepts are presented in using differentiated activities that addresses  students cognitive level in order to ensure equal entry to instruction for students with different learning styles. In addition,  materials are adapted in order to meet the individual needs of all ELL students.      SIFE students are ELLS who have attended schools in the United  States for less than twelve months and who, upon initial  enrollment in such schools are two or more years below grade level in literacy, in their home language and /or two or more  years below grade level  in mathematics due to inconsistent or interrupted schooling prior to arrival in the United States. At  P721K, SIFE students are assessed using SANDI so teachers can make a determination on what level the SIFE student will be  placed. The cognitive levels identified based on SANDI results will guide the teacher in determining the level of students work.    Instruction for all long term ELL students, regardless of their levels and classifications, is driven by goals set forth in the  students’ IEPs in all subject areas. Since communication skills and literacy skills are major deficit areas for all of our students,  including ELLs, approaches in instructional strategies and interventions used by  BIS and ENL teachers  include the utilization of  various ENL instructional strategies such as: Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach (CALLA), Total Physical Response  (TPR), Language Experience, Whole Language, using graphic organizers, pictorial/visual aids, and the use of adaptive  technology, such as communication devices. IPADS, computers, and interactive smart Boards are widely used during the  instruction.      ELL students who are newcomers and ELLs 14 - 17 years old are provided with school-based vocational experiences where they  can apply their acquired language skills by interacting with staff and students in school  and  community settings. Students  who have shown strength in reading and writing skills in English and Math skills are considered for 721K’s inclusion program at  John Dewey High School. Long term ELLs who are over the age of 18 are also considered for participation at 1 of our school’s  13 internship community based work sites.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75      Our school ensures that our students, regardless of their disabilities, receive rigorous instruction that includes academic,  functional, vocational, and career preparation that will help them become contributing members of our community. We  continue to make sure that all of our students, both mono-lingual students and ELLs, receive appropriate instruction by all  teachers through various and differentiated instructional strategies and grade-level materials to foster English Language  development.      Throughout the year, student progress is evaluated and monitored through a variety of assessments. Each fall and spring  semester, High school students at 721K participate in the SANDI Assessment. Students are tested for baseline performance in  reading, writing, communication, and math. The SANDI Assessment is analyzed for areas of strengths and deficiencies. IEP  goals are developed for each student to improve the deficient areas. For K- 2 students, teacher of ELLs uses a large variety of  big books to build phonemic awareness, language patterns and fluency in the English language. Students are able to identify  language patterns, acquire new vocabulary and learn print concepts that they are able to acquire and apply when reading  independently.  For K-2 ELL students with disabilities the assessment used is the “Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills” (ABLLS-R).  It is an educational tool used frequently with Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) to measure the basic linguistic and functional  skills of an individual with developmental delays or disabilities.  It is a skills-tracking system, used to help guide the instruction of language and critical learner skills for children with Autism or  other developmental disabilities. It provides a comprehensive review of 544 skills from 25 skill areas including language, social  interaction, self-help, academic and motor skills that most typically developing children acquire prior to entering kindergarten.  The task items within each skill area are arranged from simpler to more complex tasks. This practical tool facilitates the  identification of skills needed by the child to effectively communicate and learn from everyday experiences. The information  obtained from this assessment allows the teachers to pinpoint obstacles that have been preventing the student from acquiring  new skills and to develop a comprehensive language-based curriculum.     Based on student performance levels on the evaluations and assessments, teachers, in collaboration with related service  providers, determine the differentiated strategies of delivering instruction to each student, guaranteeing them the access to  academic content and English language development. When working with our students, our teachers also consider each  student’s preferred mode of communication, learning style, and age. Activities and instructional concepts are presented in a  variety of modalities in order to ensure equal entry to instruction for students with different learning styles. The use of  technology such as Smartboards, IPADs, computers, laptops, cameras, and communication devices ensure that all students at  721K receive rich academic content geared towards English language learning engagement and development. The curriculum  drives the instruction and is also the basis for the instructional materials needed to support academic content and language  acquisition. For our K-2 students, Fundations is used for reading, Equals for Math, ABA-VB methodology. For the HS students,  Attainment and Unique is used for ELA and Social Studies and Equals for Math. The curriculum team provides the theme for  the month that support the teachers in lesson planning aligning the lesson in the core subjects.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  In order to enable all ELL-SWD to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment  (LRE), quads or teams of teachers are formed and students are placed into classes, which are grouped into these quads, based  on their management needs and factors of age-grouping, planning of corresponding academic activities, and utilization of  Curricula that are available for students with special needs (Unique, Attainment, and Equals). Additionally, the mandates  outlined within the CR Part 154-2 will allow 721K to provide additional supports and flexibility in order for ELL-SWD to achieve  their IEP goals and attain English proficiency within the content areas.      The school ensures flexible programming by providing the teachers the support to departmentalized organization in Math,  Social Studies and ELA. This allows students to be grouped according to level of SANDI results. Transitioning from one class to  the next allows the student exposure to other peers in the school through socialization, peer to peer discussion in the  classroom.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76      In order to reinforce and supplement student learning and academic interventions, the school receives Title III grant that  allows us to open after school opportunities for ELLs. Title III after school enrich ELL students with a focused theme that enable  the students to learn intensively around the identified theme and be able to showcase their understanding through project  based activities.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  For each ELL whose score is below specified levels of performance on the annual English Language proficiency assessment, the  school determines the additional support services to provide the students, taking into consideration evidence such as the  following:   •     Number of years of instruction in a bilingual education or English as a new language program  •     English and home language literacy, content area and socio-emotional support needs of students  with                      inconsistent/interrupted formal education(SIFE)  •     English and home language literacy needs of long-term ELLs  •     Results of the NYSESLAT  •     Content area teachers, bilingual and ENL teacher recommendations  •     Parent or guardian request for support   The school provides targeted academic ELA, math, science, and social studies intervention services, in addition to extra- curricular opportunities, such as clubs, that are geared towards expanding receptive and expressive language  vocabulary, pragmatic and social skills, and additional exposure to community engagement to improve communication .            9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Our school will continue to provide all ELL students with ENL services in accordance with the CR Part 154 mandates. In addition  to three Bilingual classes, the school opened 1 ENL 12:1:1 official class geared towards transition skills and internship exposure.  The other ELL students who participate in Freestanding ENL programs, are widely engaged in transition services including  community worksites which allow them to improve communication, pragmatic and social skills in addition to mastering  content knowledge provided in school. Community- based Internships sites that they are involved in are the following:  Williamsburg Movie Theater, Haym  Solomon Rehabilitation Center, Brooklyn Hospital, P721K@ PB21K, VA Hospital and  Maimonides/Boro Park Hospital. Our ELL students also participate in culinary shops as their school-based internship site to  learn transitional and real life skills.  For our K-2 students, they are trained to be better community helpers through  participating in the New York City partnership with NY Department of Sanitation in order to learn about planet Earth, recycling  in the community and waste to decrease waste in our schools. Additionally, the school partnered with Learning through an  Expanded Art Program (LEAP) art coordinators to provide thematic literacy through the arts experiences. This past year  students conducted a unit of study on Dinosaurs and their archaeological findings. They created their own 3D Dinosaur  models, visual representation of a dinosaur scene and interacted with multiple text sources in order to have a greater  understanding of this time period.    Furthermore, the school plans to open a Mandarin TBE and Spanish TBE for the school year 2018-2019 for the K- 2  students.  The school received a 20,000 ProELL Grant  from the Division of English Language Learners and Student Support  (DELLSS). The grant will be used this school year 2017 -2018 to  prepare the teachers and staff in training and resources  procurement for opening a Bilingual Spanish class K-2  school year 2018-2019 and Bilingual Mandarin K-2 and High school.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   There was no bilingual program that was closed.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs. The Parent Teacher Association  (PTA) identifies social events that  invite all students and parents to socialize with one another. The school's extra curricular activities, such as clubs and sports  teams afforded all students the opportunity to choose an activity of high interest. For ELLs,  additional supplemental program  is provided through the Title III After- school Program. The program implements the direct instruction including activities to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77      support language development, English and home  language instruction, high academic achievement in math, and/or other  core academic areas.  The Title III supplemental instructional services are based on student needs. These supplemental services complement core  bilingual and ENL services  required under CR Part 154.  Additionally, the school provides Promise and CHAMPS afterschool  programs that target increase in socialization and sports.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Our students in all ELL programs are provided by educational materials according to the school-wide instructional tracks and  core curricula, such as ABA,  ABLLS, Equals  Pre-K Math, Equals Math, Unique Learning Systems, Passport to Social Studies,  STEMSCOPES for Science and Attainment Transition. Each classroom in our school is equipped with a Smartboard to promote  higher levels of educational engagement and interaction for all ENL students. In addition,  all of our ELL students  have access  to laptops and ipads during  instructional activities. In the TBE classes, the classroom libraries books both in English and  Yiddish. The school's library also contain books in Spanish, Yiddish, and Chinese, that all available to all students to access.  Multicultural  and multisensory  ENL materials are implemented throughout all aspects of instruction.                 13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Students that participate in the ENL program receive instruction in English with home language support.  Alternate placement  paraprofessionals provide the home language support for bilingual students who receives  ENL services. The emphasis is in the  acquisition and strengthening of the English language.     Programming that clusters cohorts of ELLs with the same home language background in subject area classrooms allows  students to access content by interacting with each other at varying levels of language proficiencies. Teachers with groups of  ELLs who have a common language organize collaborative tests that target content and generate interaction in the home  language among peers.  The tests are aimed to enriched academic English language development. Also, home language  resources (libraries, texts, technologies, primary resource materials) are made available in the classroom and in the school  library  that can assist in the acceleration of learning.   Students that participate in the TBE program receive  instructions in English and in their home language as they learn English.  TBE programs are predicated on transferring literacy skills from a student's home language to a student's new language  (English). Students acquire literacy most effectively in the language most familiar to them. Skills  used in home language  acquisition are skills that a student can use for faster and more successful acquisition of English literacy.                 14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All elementary students are placed according to their age-grade level.  High School students are grouped  ideally according to grade band however a three year age grade band is conscientiously  followed for students age 14- 16. Academic instruction and services are provided according to the IEP mandates.                 15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The building is not co-located.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Prior to accepting placement at P721K, students have the opportunity to visit the school and learn about the programs and  activities that the school offers. At the beginning of the school year, students are given a tour of the school and they are met  with key personnel (Administrators, Teachers, cluster teachers, IEP coordinators, aides, parent coordinator, Safety team)  in  the school community.  The school offers CH683 to new and current students and some ELL students availed of the  opportunity to start at P721K during the summer. The students were provided with ENL/TBE services as per IEP mandate.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    At this time, the school does not offer language electives.          18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   At this time, the school does not offer dual language programs.         Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   At the onset of the school year,  all teachers are provided a period of time to log into the District 75 professional development  portal, and sign up for professional developments that would respond and enhance teaching skills to benefit all students,  especially the ELL population.  Next, the administrators look into the teachers' professional development selection, and  approve professional developments that would enhance instruction with all students, especially ELL students.  Teachers (not  TBE/ENL certified) of ELL students are recommended to participate in professional development for at least 50% of the total  hours. TBE/ENL certified teachers as per CR Part 154 mandate for professional development are afforded the support needed  as they comply with the mandated PD hours.  DELLSS and OELLS provide professional developments that are geared towards  the understanding of ELL students and PDs that respond to the implementation of CR Part 154.2.  Teachers are  highly  recommended to participate in professional development sessions that are offered in these departments.  Part of the school's  professional development plan is a professional learning community schedule, where teachers meet every Wednesday to  analyze student data, discuss student performance levels, and plans for ELL instruction.  Teachers who have been rated  Ineffective or Developing are supported with a Teacher Improvement Plan (TIP).    All professional development sessions that are provided through the OELLS, DELLSS, and District 75 refer to supporting ELLS as  they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards.  To name a few: the New ELL Teacher Professional Learning Institute for  ENL and bilingual teachers 2 years of less in District 75, Jose P. Training for non ENL (ESL) and bilingual teachers, ELL Teacher  Professional Learning Institute Sessions, ELL Compliance Professional Learning Institute, and the Home Language Arts  Professional Learning Series.               2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    We provide support to staff in assisting ELLs by facilitating open dialogue and open communication with current and future  placement providers.  We provide teachers, related service providers, and guidance counselors with information , professional  development, data analysis and inquiry to guide them in transitioning ELL students. Additionally, the Pupil Personnel Team  (PPT), comprised of school administrators, guidance counselors, and SAVE team, meets every month to discuss  specific student issues and concerns.       Teachers are required to participate in professional development (PD) that focus on best practices in co-teaching strategies  and language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction for ELLs.  Teachers are provided afforded a period  during the first reporting day to sign up for PDs on the D75 portal. Once teachers have signed up for professional development  sessions, the administrative team reviews their selection for the compliance of CR Part 154.2, and guides teachers to attend  ELL-specific PDs.  All records of professional development activities are kept by teachers and recorded on the PD log binder   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79         that is with the Secretary, and all teachers have online access to their own District 75 PD log of attended PDs. Supervisors can  also identify PDs that teachers have attended and add the PD's to the teacher's ADVANCE write-up's.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   All ENL and TBE teachers are required by the school to provide annual individual meetings. This additional meeting should  include school staff necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the child's language development in all  content areas in English and in the child's home language in the case of student's enrolled in a bilingual education program.  Such meeting is conducted with a  qualified interpreter/translator in the language of the parent or mode of communication  that the parent or guardian best understands. The school determines the manner and form of such individual parent meetings,  in accordance with collective bargaining agreements. The school records attendance using existing procedures.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parent -Teacher Association (PTA) prepare monthly activities for students and their families to cultural growth and social  interaction. The PTA  conducts annual PASS Reviews ensuring access and  availability of all instructional  resources to students  and teachers.  The school together with the PTA have identified dates for recreational events that are open to all students and  their families.Our school arranges a series of 'Saturday Meeting" with parents and students . These sessions provide the  families with all types of important  information and resources, such as  health, educational, and translation resources  available in the community. The Title III Program  engages the parents in a wide range of activities , promoting  multicultural  awareness and respect.             Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Barbara Tremblay, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.
