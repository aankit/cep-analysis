This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our mission is to ensure that all scholars acquire the knowledge, skills, and habits of mind to succeed in a challenging  college program.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Queens Preparatory Academy (QPA) is located in South East Queens and serves approximately 375 scholars in grades  9 through 12. 62% of our scholars receive free or reduced lunch. We opened our doors in 2005 committed to our  mission of providing our scholars with rigorous college preparatory curricula within a stable, respectful and caring  support network. Queens Preparatory Academy is a learning organization where scholars are held to high standards  and high expectations. It is a community where scholars are known as individuals and nurtured to achieve academic  success. Our scholars are actively engaged in inquiry, problem solving and reflection with special emphasis on the  mathematics and science disciplines.    Seven years ago we partnered with iZone 360 and New Tech Network to expand our vision to include teaching and  learning 21 st century skills. Our scholars engage in inquiry-based and problem-based learning to master content as  well as achieve proficiency in five 21 st century skills: communication, collaboration, critical thinking/ problem solving,  productivity & accountability and information technology. We are also part of New York City Department Of  Education's AP For ALL initiative to increase equity and access to scholars in District 29 to advanced courses that  prepare our scholars for to succeed in competitive post-secondary programs.

English & Composition and A.P. English Literature. As participants of the  College Access for All initiative, we partner with Peer Forward, an organization that trains and empowers student  leaders to design and implement three college-going campaigns to mobilize our seniors to complete college  applications, financial aid applications and personal statements. Student leaders are also charged with assisting our  guidance team on educating our 9th, 10th and 11th grade scholars and their families on the college process. Youth  development is paramount at our school and is spearheaded by our a college education class which meets once a  week for 9-12 grade scholars. College Ed is a credit bearing course where scholars read, write and discuss topics such  as self- efficacy, mindsets, college access, career counseling, community service, organizational skills, resume writing,  decision making and conflict resolution. We have three additional student leadership groups, Sisterhood, Brotherhood  and Queens Prep Student Advisory Board. Our Community Service/External learning Program offers our scholars to  partake in service learning opportunities, job shadows, community service hours and internships. We offer our  students access to S.T.E.A.M. courses with electives such as Introduction to Computer Programming, Advanced  Computer Programming & Robotics and Video Production. This year are scholars are engaged in the Model UN club,  Debate Team, Photography/Video Club, Science Research Club, Girls Who Code.

We also offer our 10-12th grades students music and are partnered with The Comedy Hall of Fame which  offers our students a beginners and advanced improvisation course. Our scholars are exposed to college tours and  career explorations from grades 9-12.             3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We have Students with Special Needs who receive integrated Co-teaching services. Students require additional  support, scaffolded instruction, multiple entry points for learning and accommodations and modifications for  instructional tasks and assessments. Some of these students also need counseling services. We also have English  language learners from grades 9-12 who need targeted instruction in acquiring the English language, speaking,  reading and writing English, social and emotional support to positively adjust to the new school system, culture and  environment.      4.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     1) In an analysis of our 2017-2018 School Quality Guide state that we are meeting the target for Quality of student  discussion and Academic Press as measured by the 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey. Our 2016-2017 Quality  Review Report states for the Instructional core, curriculum (1.1), pedagogy (1.2) and assessment (1.3) the following  findings and impact respectively:   Findings: "School leaders and faculty ensure that curricula are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS)  and offer multiple entry points across grade levels. "   Impact: " School leaders and staff are building coherence across all grade and subject levels, integrating instructional  strategies, such as differentiation and scaffolding, and incorporating instructional shifts, such as citing textual  evidence and writing form sources."   Findings: "A set of beliefs on how students learn best is reflected across teacher practices that are aligned to the  curricula and the Danielson Framework for Teaching. Student work products reflect high levels of thinking and  participation. "    Impact: "Student have opportunities to demonstrate critical thinking and are active participants in their learning.  There is extensive use of instructional strategies that support discussion and active student engagement."   Findings: Teachers create and use rubrics, assessments, and grading policies that are aligned to the curricula.  Ongoing checks for understanding offer a clear picture of student progress towards meeting goals across grade levels.   Impact: Teacher feedback is actionable and provides students with an understanding of their academic progress  and achievement. Frequent assessments allow teachers to make adjustments to meet the needs of all  students.    An analysis of the Item Analysis for ELA June 2018 Regents states that our average ELA score for all students, 66.31, is  1.31 points above the citywide average of 65. Our student subgroup, Students with Disabilities average ELA Regents  score increased 14.23 points from 46.06 in June 2017 to 60.29 in June 2018. Our student subgroup, English Language  Learners average ELA Regents score increased 17.98 points from 29.90 in June 2017 to 47.88 in June 2018.   2) An analysis of our average regents score for June 2018 show that over a span of two years are average scores have  only had a significant increase for Global History with an average score of 65.0 on June 2018 Regents exam, an  increase of 9.1 points from 55.9 average score on June 2016 Regents Exam. There was a slight increase of the average  score on the June 2018 U.S. History Regents exam from 63.8 in June 2016 to 64.5 in June 2018 , Algebra 1 remained   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      the same with a average score of 64.2 for June 2016 and June 2018. However we experienced a significant decline in  our average scores for ELA and Living Environment, each declining approximately 5.5 points from June 2016 to June  2018. In close analysis of the constructed responses of the June 2018 Regents exam, our scholars are below the  citywide average for the open-ended constructed responses in all regents exams except ELA where for the 6 pt essay  our scholars average score is 4.23 as compared to the citywide average of 3.75.    Taking a closer look at our subgroup data for Algebra 1, we find that our average score for our students with  disabilities decreased 10 points from 59.13 in June 2017 to 49.13 in June 2018 and the average score for our English  Language Learners decreased 7.3 points from 66.78 in June 2017 to 59.48 in June 2018.    Although we were 1.31 points higher than the citywide average score for the June 2018 ELA regents, our average  regents scores for all students, over the past two years, have decreased except for Global History.  Although we made  significant gains with our students with disabilities and English language learners on the June 2018 ELA regents, these  subgroups also experienced a significant decline in their average regents score for Algebra I.    Our priorities for this school year are to build on the success of our teaching of writing in our ELA curriculum and  engage our scholars in writing argumentative writing tasks across the content areas using rubrics. In addition, we will  focus on providing differentiated instructional strategies for our students with disabilities, English language learners,  bottom third and high performing scholars in our task design and implementation with multiple entry points, targeted  scaffolds and supports, extensions and challenges.           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  1) In our 2016-2017 Quality Review report we received a "well developed rating for indicator 3.4 High Expectations.  The report states,   Findings: "School leaders and staff consistently communicate high expectations connected to a pathway to college  and careers that is embedded throughout the entire school. The school successfully partners with families and offers  feedback and supports to all students and their families".   Impact: "Students are supported through a variety of means that empower them and prepare them for life after high  school. This includes extensive focus on the college application process starting in ninth grade".   The 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey states that we are meeting the target for Guidance in Supportive  Environment captured by, "88% of high school students say that adults at their school encourage them to continue  their education after high school" and "91% of high school students say that adults at their school inform them about  the college application process".    2)However, although we gained 6 percentage point in scholars responding positively to the peer academic support  questions and personal attention and support questions on the 2017 -2018 Learning Environment Survey, these are  areas where we did not meet the NYCDOE target in Supportive School Environment.  Our survey reports, "49% of  students say that teachers help them catch up if they are behind"; "51% of students say that teachers notice if they  have trouble learning something".; "58% of students say that teachers give them specific suggestions about how they  can improve their work" and "54% of students say that teachers explain things a different way if they don’t  understand something".    Although , we have done work in social and emotional learning , where 79% of teachers responded positively on the  2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey, the social -emotional practices have not been transferred to the academic  culture of every teacher's classroom. This school year we will address strategies to embed social and emotional  learning into the classroom and structures for teachers to foster a environment of student agency which include  student-goal setting, monitoring growth and growth mindsets.

On the 2016-2017 Quality Review  Report our school earned a proficient score on indicator 4.2 Teacher Teams and Leadership Development. The report  states the following,   Findings: Teachers are engaged in regular collaborative inquiry sessions that analyze student work and  instructional practices. Teachers take on leadership roles through a variety of ways, most notably through  the group inter-visitation process.  Impact: Collaborative planning and teacher voice contribute to school-wide instructional coherence and increased  student achievement. The work of teacher teams results in enhanced instructional capacity, building rigor,  and student engagement.      2) Taking a closer look at the 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey 70% of Queens Preparatory Academy teachers  responded positively to the Innovation and Collective Responsibility, which was 6 percentage points below the city  average. 84% responded positively to Peer Collaboration which was 3 percentage points below the city average. The  following are four questions from the survey :   Innovation and Collective Responsibility: 67% of teachers say that teachers take responsibility for improving the  school. (Q1c) and 76%of teachers say that teachers feel responsible that all students learn. (Q1e)   Peer Collaboration: 76% of teachers say that they design instructional programs (for example, lessons and units)  together. (Q8a) and 76% of teachers say that at their school the principal, teachers, and staff collaborate to make the  school run effectively. (Q8c)   Although our teachers are comfortable working in teacher teams, the data above suggests our teachers may need to  work more closely with each other on topics of their choice that directly impact their classroom practice.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

Teachers are taken through a four-step interview process which includes resume review by  administration, group interview by members of the faculty and selected students, in-person interview by  administration, demonstration lesson and feedback from students, review of teacher artifacts and student work.   Teachers are assigned to teach in their license area. Teachers receive monthly to twice a month professional  development to develop and implement unit plans aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and effective  instructional strategies aligned to the Danielson’s Framework for Teaching.    New teachers are mentored at least twice a week by tenured teachers . Teachers meet in weekly Critical Friends  Group to examine student work, interim assessments, teacher’s unit plans/performance tasks to make instructional  decisions to impact student performance.   Teachers attend professional development sessions outside of the school given by NYCDOE and professional  organizations.   Teachers receive regular feedback from administration on unit plans, lesson plans, assessments and instructional  practices through conferences, instructional rounds and mini-observations.   Differentiated opportunities include network workshops, conferences, and courses are offered for professional  growth.   Teachers of Advanced Placement classes attend AP workshops offered by the College Board.   Effective teachers are selected as Team Leaders to build teacher capacity and facilitate teacher inquiry and CFG  meetings.   Sharing of practice from data collected through walkthroughs and instructional rounds are facilitated by schools  leaders, coaches so effective teaching practices are recognized and teachers can learn from each other.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Teachers meet in content vertical team meetings as Critical Friends to examine their teaching practice in an inquiry  stance.         2b.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42   Column B   Section Reference(s)  X              X        State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Queens Preparatory Academy, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   [Queens Preparatory Academy] will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The formative assessments that are currently being used to determine the literacy skills of the English Language Learners are  the periodic assessments, NYSITELL, NYSESLAT and RNMR Modality Data. From the data, it is seen that the ELLs have made  improvements, with the added support and intervention of differentiated instruction. The ENL teacher can also use the data  from the NYSESLAT components to create and modify instruction with the content and other language teachers to improve  students’ speaking, listening, writing and reading skills     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The structures that are in place to support this effort includes the analysis of the data to understand the areas where students  need support. Using the previous year’s data as well as meeting with content teachers, the ENL teacher is able to change and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         modify in-class formative and informative assessments, the instructional tools and strategies, and materials needed. To  support student reading, students are given laptops to access sites that have interactive ENL activities, comprehension  passages, and follow up tests/quizzes to test student understanding. Teachers are also using authentic texts and information  from student background and prior knowledge for students to relate and access the material in their own language and related  back to their culture. Students are also given dictionaries to carry with them throughout the day, to other subject area classes  for assitance in vocabulary when needed.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Using the NYSESLAT results, the successful passing of content courses and Regents exams, and graduation of the ENL students,  the success and quality of the ENL program can be evaluated. In addition to this, ENL students’ in class assignments and  assessments can be evaluated to see the growth and improvement of students. Students are given end of the unit exams and  essays that test skills and content that is necessary to know for both the NYSESLAT and their NYS Regents Exams.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered, students are given the opportunity to attend tutoring and Regents preparatory  review sessions during and after school. Students are also given textbooks and workbooks that are geared toward their  proficiency levels. Content glossaries in both English and the students’ home language are given to them, that can be used  both at home and in class. Using the summative data, students are also grouped differently and given differentiated tasks  during class to assess the content and skills they are proficient in and need work on building.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Of the 47 ELLs enrolled in the academic year 2017-2018, 44 students took the NYSESLAT in Spring 2018. Of the 44, 3 (6.8%)  students scored commanding, 12 (27.3%) students scored expanding, 12 (27.3%) students scored transitioning, 6 (13.6%)  students scored emerging, and 2 (4.5%) student scored entering. These scores are used to designate the students into the  appropriate class with the required ENL minutes they need to be serviced form. This information also allows the content and  ENL teacher to bring and use material that is appropriate for the students to achieve the skills needed for their grade level.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   According to the findings, the ENL teacher meets with the guidance counselors to certify that the ELLs are being placed in the  appropriate classes and receiving the allotted ENL instruction time, required from CR Part 154. Letters are also sent home to  notify parents and guardians of the students’ ELL status and the services that will be provided for them in the current and  upcoming academic year.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         The ENL students are programmed into classes that will meet their requirement according to their status. Entering  level students are grouped graded and homogeneously in a standalone ENL classroom. Emerging students join with  the entering level students, and the grouping of the students during class alternates between homogenous and  heterogeneous groupings depending on the task the students are completing. These students are also placed in an  integrated classroom with an English teacher, with dual certification in ELA and ENL instruction. Transitioning,  expanding and commanding level ELLs are in integrated ELA, science and math classes, in which the ENL teacher  works with the students in providing the appropriate assessment and instruction.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Using prior years NYSESLAT results, conversation with the guidance counselors and administrational professionals, ELLs are  programmed into the required minutes of standalone ENL or integrated courses, as mandated in CR Part 154. Entering level  ELLs receive two periods of standalone ENL instruction, 5 times a week, as well as one period of integrated ELA with a dual  certified instructor in ELA and ENL. The first period class is grouped homogeneously with all entering level students, whereas  the second is either homogenously or heterogeneously, depending on the task that needs to be completed. The ENL teacher  pushes into 1 integrated ELA class 5 times a week, which is 12th grade ELA. The ENL teacher also pushes into an integrated  science class 5 times a week for second period, in which one is 10th grade Living Environment. and the other 11th grade Living  Environment.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   To ensure that the core content is being delivered and accessed by the ELLs, the ENL and content teacher meet to discuss the  approach to tasks, grouping, and assessments that will be used in the classroom. Appropriate graphic organizers, modified  texts, and materials are brought in for the ELLs to use and access the material the mainstream students. Students are also  given content glossaries in their home language and English to use for the courses they are enrolled in. The ENL teacher and  content teacher also attend professional development series and workshops, separately and together to ensure that they are  receiving the appropriate material and information needed for ENL instruction within content areas.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   All incoming students that can be a possible ELL student is interviewed with their parent/guardian to determine whether they  are evaluated appropriately and tested. Students are administered the NYSITELl and the Spanish LAB if applicable. Teachers  that are able to translate are also utilized to communicate the appropriate information to a student or parent/guardian,  whether it is for an in-person conversation or over the phone.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE students will be given access to material the newcomer ELLs are given, and will have individualized tutoring sessions  during and after school. To build students' phonemic awareness and phonics, students will be able to listen to and watch  videos that will aid students in building fluency in the English language.b. Newcomer ELLs will be provided instruction in their  home language and English, using translated worksheets, powerpoints, and laptops for students' to access translation services.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      Students are also grouped with other students that speak the same language. Teachers bring in material and texts from the  students' backgrounds to demonstrate and give students the assurance that their culture, language and background are  valued. Visual aid, realia, videos, and drills are used for students to be engaged and have access to the material, based on their  learning style. Scaffolds such as sentence starters, partial graphic organizers and anchor charts are available for students to  build a foundation for the development of language. Students' are not discouraged from using their first language in order to  communicate with their peers or when asking for help.c. Developing ELLs are given the same tools as the newcomer ELLs, with  modified texts and tools for their level of English proficiency. Students are still given scaffolds to use. Students are required to  meet during and after school for tutoring sessions, with both content and ENL teachers.d. Long-term ELLs will meet with ENL  teachers to continue developing language for their content classes, as well as academic vocabulary that will be present on  their state examinations. The focus of these ELLs will be in developing reading comprehension for longer texts, and  development of writing to reach the standards that are addressed for their grade level.e. For all former ELLs, they receive  integrated ENL instruction through ELA or a content area, including Science, Math, or Social Studies. In addition, they still  receive testing accomodations.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The ENL teacher is given the grade-level materials from the content area teachers ahead of time to see what material and skills  the ELLs need to access and achieve. Students are then given modified texts and supplemental aid in the form of graphic  organizers, visuals, audio material, and laptops, as well as put into flexible grouping during classroom time and after school  tutoring sessions. ENL teachers and teachers servicing SWD will meet up to discuss the methods and supplemental material  that can be used for both groups of students, as well as for those students who are in both subgroups.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Using technology along with differentiated material and instruction, the ELLs are able to work towards reaching the standards  that are required of them. ELLs are also given the opportunity to come to after-school tutoring sessions, in which a small group  allows for the ENL teacher to have more time to work one-on-one with them, in both the subjects and language they are  struggling with. With the implementation of the Alternative Pathways to Support Former English Language Learners Language  Development and Academic Progress, students are able to have flexibility in their scheduling as well, if they are interested and  at level to take advanced placement courses or other courses.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The entering level ELLs and SIFE students are required to come to tutoring during the school period to practice the language  that was used during instructional time in their standalone class, as well as get help with their content subject homework.  Emerging, transitioning, developing and commanding students are given the opportunity to come during after-school tutoring  sessions, in which the ENL teacher works with together with the Science teacher in Regents preparatory review or separate  vocabulary and writing workshops for other content areas. Intervention services also involve the content and ELL teachers  sitting and co-planning instruction and materials to be used for support in and outside of the classroom.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on the data and trends, the school will plan to use more ELL based textbooks and workbooks for the upcoming school  year. Data from last year showed improvement in students English and Math literacy with the use of annotation and reading  techniques, that will continue this year in the content areas to improve science and math literacy. The school will also look into  specific individualized ELL programs, such as Achieve 3000. Tier 1 and Tier 2 vocabulary will continue to be used and practiced  within the classroom and during after-school sessions, with a focus on students developing accountable talk, questioning and  discussion in preparation for college and career environments.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are given the space to come after school to complete homework assignments, projects, or get access to technology such  as laptops, that they might not have at home. Students have tutoring sessions available for them in both their content and  language teachers. ELLs are encouraged to join after school programs, sports and clubs to gain social skills by interaction with  their peers, as well as give them a medium to express themselves. For ELLs that have not met credit requirements, there are  also online classes available for them after school. After school time with the ENL teacher allows for students to be exposed to  regents and test material ahead of time.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  ELLs are provided with dictionaries, translated material, and laptops in their ENL classrooms and content courses. Students use  the laptops for project based learning, homework and classroom assignments, and for translation services by using Google  translate. The SMARTboard and projectors are also used as a tool for the teachers to display information, through visuals and  sound. ELLs are exposed to using technology for presentations as well, which prepares them for career and college  environments where public speaking will be required.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In the ENL setting, students are given notes and worksheets in their home language and English. Anchor charts in the  classroom are also translated for key terms and vocabulary that students need to access. Google translate is also used for  students to read and hear questions and answers.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The school ensures that all required services and resources support and correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels by meeting  with the guidance counselors, content teachers, parent coordinator and administration, to ensure material and tools can be  given to the students. The ENL teacher works with the content teachers inside the classroom, during team meetings and after  school to provide and receive material necessary for students to attain the skills needed for their grade level. Resources are  provided to students for them to access material at home and in the classroom, through the use of Google classroom, the  Remind App and iOS Classroom. Students' transcripts are also reviewed to make sure they are placed in the correct classes that  will meet graduation requirements.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The school shares a building with three other schools. The ENL teacher has taught students from other schools in previous  years, so communication between the teachers are vital in providing the student the necessary instruction. The ENL teachers'  coordination and sharing resources are vital in the success of the ELLs. Since there is a community of teachers providing  services to ELLs, the teachers are able to coordinate by going to professional development workshops together and sharing  student data to assist in modifying instruction and assessments. Resources such as dictionaries, workbooks, textbooks and  parent communication tools are also shared.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELLs are given information from the guidance counselor in regards to activities, schedules and the information  needed in order for them to access their online accounts for the year. Students are also given information for the appropriate  teachers the students can contact for tutoring and extra help.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All teachers are teachers of ELL students, whether they are the content or ENL teacher. Content teachers and ENL teachers are  given the opportunity to attend professional development workshops together, as well as separate, to access the information  and tools that they can bring back to their school. The principal at Queens Preparatory Academy gives time during after school  professional development for content teachers and ENL teachers to assess student data, which includes the ELLs and SWDs.  The ENL teacher is given the opportunity to share techniques and tools that they have received from workshops during vertical  team meetings with content teachers from different grades.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The ENL teacher is given opportunities to attend professional development provided by the DOE, in which material and tools  can be brought back to the school to be shared amongst the professional staff. According to Chancellor's Regulations,  professional development with staff at Queens Preparatory Academy are held on Mondays.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents are invited to Student Support Nights and Curriculum Night in which the parents are given an introduction and then an  in-depth review of what an ELL and ENL program is. Parents can come with their child and ask questions pertaining to the  program overall or their individual child's needs. The ENL teacher provides parents with ENL resources that they can access  from home and given the opportunity to practice what their child does in the class. This includes having the parents engage in  an activity or discussion similar to the ones their child does in the classroom (conversation clubhouse, think-write-pair-share,  gallery walks, etc.)    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Parents are invited to Student Support Nights and parent night conferences, in which they are given information about the ENL  program and their child's progress in their class. At these meetings, parents are given material and presentations in their own  language, through the use of a translator. Translation services are done through the use of a professional who speaks the  parents' home language or having the parents use the laptops to communicate and get access to the information in their home  language. Families and friends of ELLs are also invited to attend meetings and club events throughout the year, where they are  able to communicate with the teachers of their children and participate in events that showcase their child's work  (Multicultural Night, Talent Show, etc.)      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62            Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Tashon Haywood, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   QUEENS PREPARATORY ACADEMY                                                                              School DBN: 29Q248  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The data and methodologies used to assess our school’s written translation and oral interpretation needs include  Home Language Surveys, Parent Choice Surveys, letters and phone calls. Each of these are provided in students’  home language and English to ensure that parents are provided with appropriate and timely information in a  language they can understand. In the first few days of the school year, letters with students’ NYSESLAT or  NYSITELL scores are sent home to inform families of the student’s status as an English Language learner and what  the next steps are in regarding their academic success.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      If available, in the event of a school emergency, the school will have a faculty member proficient in English and the  home language to speak with a family member on the situation at hand. Using the emergency blue cards, school  faculty will be able to see what language the student’s emergency contact will be able to communicate in. There is  also the telephone translation services to call the families of the student.to inform them of any updates and changes  in the case of a school emergency.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.

Staff and faculty will be made aware of where resources for the ELLs and their  families are throughout the year so they can communicate with families in their home language when necessary.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Based on our schools written translation and interpretation needs, we found that parents need more workshops and  orientation dates to familiarize themselves with the English as a New Language (ENL) program, as well as the  technologies they can access to communicate with the school and track student progress. Findings were reported to  the school community by way of information during School Leadership meetings, Parent-Teacher Conferences, one- to-one meetings with students and parents after school, and faculty conferences. During the intake of new students,  our certified faculty for ELLs conduct an informal interview with the parent(s)/guardian(s) of the student and the  student themselves, to determine the primary language spoken at home by the student. There are currently 46  parent/families of our ELL students. Languages spoken by the ELLs comprise of Arabic, Haitian Creole, Spanish, French  and Krio. Throughout the year, parents will be made aware of any parent teacher conferences, workshops and  orientations that will take place, which will also provide them with any translation services if needed. Brochures and  letters will be sent home in the students’ home language and English.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Through informal interviews with parents/guardian during the registration of the student, the ELL parent choice  survey, and the information gathered from the home language survey, our faculty and staff at Queens Preparatory  Academy works together in making sure all documents sent home are translated in the students’ home language.  During Parent-Teacher Conferences throughout the year, the students’ ENL teacher and subject teachers are able to  hear from the families of the students to discuss any further services the families need and other services that are  available for them to facilitate communication within the school and community as a whole. Using the data we  gathered from documents such as the HL survey and interviews held with families, QPA has worked toward holding  parent orientations for the ELL parents to discuss the different technological tools available for them outside of the  school to communicate with the faculty and staff and track student progress. We have also made interpretation  services available for any meetings held at the school and updating the interpretation languages that should be  readily available based upon intake of new students.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70
