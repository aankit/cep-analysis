This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our families and students. Strong Schools, Strong Communities The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult. The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students. The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students. Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members concrete ways to improve. In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 2018-19 CEP 7  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing that it likely addresses other elements as well. The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value each other. The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative and qualitative data. NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below: I. Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) II. School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4) III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) School Quality Guide The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 2018-19 CEP 8  Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, professional development, and parent and family engagement. To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:   It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) Next Steps for CEP Development School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school community know when you’ve reached your goal.  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to accomplishing desired results. 1. What is your school’s mission statement?

Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 2018-19 CEP 12  Special Education Special Education: All students with IEPs, regardless of their instructional setting, receive access to the general education curriculum with the appropriate supports and specialized instruction to meet their individual needs and learning styles. *There are students with IEPs in various settings throughout the school- see content areas above. Our special education teachers meet monthly to plan as a department. In addition, we send representatives to monthly Borough Liaison meetings to receive pertinent information. This information is then shared at our monthly meetings with the entire department in order to better support our SWD student population. We offer professional learning opportunities weekly with a focus ranging from compliance to instruction and sharing best practices. We also offer weekly professional learning sessions for paraprofessionals. These learning opportunities focus on the specific needs of our paraprofessionals. We work with them to support their role in the classroom and how they can support students of various classifications. We currently have full time and part time ICT classes as well as 12:1 and 12:1:1 classes. We have paraprofessionals assigned to classrooms as well as individual students. Our special education classes also have one class on a grade level in both ICT and Self contained comprised of current and former ELL/SWD students. These classes are taught by a dual licensed teacher (special education and ENL). In addition, we provide monthly parent meetings to inform and update parents of our special education program here at 217 as well as to provide support for parents with things they can do at home with their children. ENL - Our ELL population consists of Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding ELLs (both year 1 and year 2) The percentages are as follows: Grade 6 Students: Emerging 8 (6%) Transitioning 19 (16%) Expanding 60 (51%) Commanding 30 (25%) Grade 7 Students: Entering 2 (1%) Emerging 11 (9%) Transitioning 28 (23%) Expanding 55 (46%) Commanding 22 (18%) Grade 8 Students: Entering 3 (2%) Emerging 13 (10%) Transitioning 13 (10%) Expanding 41 (34%) Commanding 49 (41%) 4.

Subgroups Passing (students/percentage) SWD - 63 / 60% ENL - 70 / 19% Students scored weakest relative to the city on questions testing Homeostasis and Immunity specifically questions numbers 3, 38, 40, 47, 63 and 64 from the June 2018 Regents Exam. Specific standards on the Living Environment regents and Key Ideas in need of special attention include: INSERT SPECIFIC STANDARDS ENL Needs Analysis: There was a need for a common core aligned curriculum that is specific to Entering/ Emerging ELLs and encompasses their need for language acquisition, phonetic skills, grammar, sentence structure, syntax, word structure, and reading comprehension skills. We continue to implement and supplement a curriculum (Fundamentals 1 and 2) that fits all these criteria. We continue to modify the existing Expeditionary Learning curriculum to service Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding ELLs to include scaffolds based on the NYS ELA assessment data from June 2018. The data showed that in eighth grade, 2% of current ELL students scored at a Level 3 and 4, in seventh grade 4% of students scored at levels 3 and 4, and in sixth grade 4% of ELL students scored at levels 3 and 4. NYS Math assessment data showed that in eighth grade, 0% of students scored at a Level 3 and 4, 2018-19 CEP 19  in seventh grade, 4% scored at a Level 3 and 4, and in sixth grade, 2% scored at a Level 3 and 4. Review of the item skills analysis showed weakness in all common core standards. In addition, the goal was set based on NYSESLAT 2018 data. It showed the following: GRADE 6 96% of our last year’s 6th Grade students (current 7th graders) moved up one level and/or remained at the same level from the previous year. GRADE 7 100% of our last year’s 7th Grade students (current 8th graders) moved up one level and/or remained at the same level from the previous year.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? Indicate the data trends, source and year. Needs Assessment: We analyzed various data resources from the 2017-2018 school year (Learning Environment Survey, general school surveys, observation MOTP data, sign in sheet from all collaborative conversation opportunities, and professional learning exit surveys, 2017-2018 intervisitation log with feedback, and town hall meeting minutes). We determined that there is a need to increase the percentage of teacher led intervisitations into each others' classrooms as a professional learning opportunity with a focus on refining teacher practice to support our schoolwide instructional focus. After analysis of this data, polling the teachers in June 2018 and again in September 2018, initial collaborative planning meetings with our Instructional Team in August and September, and review of town meeting minutes from June 2018, it was determined that we would implement a plan of action that would allow teachers to increase the amount of teacher led intervisitations, facilitated by a PCT or a model teacher, and these intervisitations would in turn result in a 10% increase in the frequency of student led conferences. This goal will be supported by Administration and our instructional support team. Our Instructional Team is comprised of Model Teachers, Peer Collaborative Teachers, and Administrators, and the team meets bi-monthly during the school year. Model teachers are highly skilled educators who use their skills to develop colleagues’ knowledge, skill base and promote a collaborative environment that positively affects every member of their school community. Collaboration, sharing, and trust are core professional values that are expected of a Model Teacher. They work effectively and efficiently with colleagues with diverse experiences; they are self-guided and work autonomously with superior communication skills; and they feel confident in their ability to lead others. Their duties include: Support pedagogical growth by showcasing their professional and pedagogical practices, including the processes for reflecting on and adjusting their practice through the promotion of intervisitations into their classrooms Reflect on and debriefing their own lessons with colleagues, both sharing knowledge and modeling a collaborative environment Demonstrate and articulate effective teaching practices, Foster trusting and collaborative relationships with colleagues in order to encourage intervisitation Work collaboratively with colleagues Work with school leadership to improve curriculum and maximize use of the Danielson Framework and Common Core Learning Standards 2018-19 CEP 38  Peer Collaborative teachers are highly skilled educators who use their skills to develop colleagues’ knowledge and skill base, and promote a collaborative environment that positively affects every member of their school community.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. Prior to hiring a candidate, their credentials are verified by our Human Resources (HR) Director to ensure that the candidate holds a valid NYS certification in that license area. The BEDS survey is reviewed by the Principal and the HR Director who work with our school to ensure that every teacher’s assignment aligns with their license area so that all teachers are reported as Highly Qualified on the BEDS Survey. Strategies and activities used to recruit, retain and support highly qualified teachers are indicated below: ● Utilization of NYCDOE and district HR department ● Utilization of our partnership with universities to identify potential teaching candidates ● Utilization of NYCDOE Teacher Finder Utilization of Teacher Center coach, Lead Math teacher, Peer Instructional Coaches, Demonstration Teachers, and lead mentors to provide professional development and support to all newly hired and non-tenured teachers 2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS). To determine professional learning targets our instructional support team members analyze various data resources (NYS Exam data, Advance MOTP data, school administered exam data, and school survey data). After an analysis of this data we provide weekly targeted professional learning opportunities facilitated by our coaches, PICs, DTs, CFN, and school based supervisors. These professional learning opportunities take place daily during regular school hours titled Lunch and Learns, and during extended day hours on Mondays, and Wednesdays. Our school developed a comprehensive professional learning plan that addresses CCLS, Danielson components, our instructional focus and school-wide goals. Professional learning opportunities are also differentiated based on the needs of groups of teachers and individual teachers. 2018-19 CEP 60  Our high quality professional development will include but not be limited to the following: ● Teachers will participate in professional learning opportunities conducted by PIC and Demonstration teachers, content coaches, instructional lead teachers and Assistant Principals in the content areas of ELA, Math, Science, ESL, and Social Studies. In addition, professional learning will target special education strategies. ● The Principal, APs, coaches and instructional lead teachers will attend workshops provided by the district and by Central relating to CCLS and Danielson. They will turnkey the information and deliver workshops or Lunch and Learns to teachers and paraprofessionals in the use of DOK, Essential questions, Checks for Understanding, ongoing assessment practices to increase best practices and to increase academic rigor in literacy, math, science and social studies aligned with CCLS. Teacher teams will be trained in how to use data effectively to develop flexible grouping, track student performance trends and elevate programs and strategies in order to monitor and revise their practices.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to improve instruction. In June 2018 we formed a Measure of Student learning committee comprised of five teachers and 4 administrators. The team reviewed NYS and school based data to determine assessment measures for the school year 2018-2019. Members of the team attended NYCDOE facilitated professional development on the assessment process. In 2018-19 CEP 61  September 2018 the team will present the assessment decisions to our staff. Teachers and paraprofessionals were given an opportunity for Q&A, as well as, time for suggestions. As the year has progressed our teachers and paraprofessionals have daily opportunities to attend daily Collaborative Conversations facilitated by teachers, Monday PL, and full day professional development. This PL is focused on analyzing current student data, and then utilizing the findings to adjust curriculum and instruction. 4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated. Program Name Place an (X) in Column A below to verify that the school has met the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated. Indicate in Column B, section references where a related program activity has been described in this plan. Column A Verify with an (X) X X X Column B Section Reference(s) 17-51 17-31, 38-40, 49-51 17-51 Fund Source (i.e. Federal, State or Local) Funding Amount Indicate the amount contributed to Schoolwide pool. (Refer to Galaxy for school allocation amounts) Title I Part A (Basic) Title II, Part A Title III, Part A Title III, Immigrant Tax Levy (FSF) Federal Federal Federal Federal Local 731,060.00 0 35,792.00 0 8,770,510.00 1Explanation/Background: Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students. Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds. 2018-19 CEP 62  Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different sources when accounting for their use.  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended beneficiaries are met. 2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as follows:  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional program.  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language instruction programs.  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of English language acquisition and content area achievement. Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education designed to meet their individual needs.   Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application. 2018-19 CEP 63  Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC) (Required for All Title I Schools) Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy. Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. Parent and Family Engagement Policy Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school. Robert A Van Wyck MS 217 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students Robert A Van Wyck MS 217 will support parents and families of Title I students by: ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision making in support of the education of their children; ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor their child’s progress; ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 2018-19 CEP 64  ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in languages that parents can understand; ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other members of the school community; The school’s Parent Involvement Parental Involvement and School Quality The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home; ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 2018-19 CEP 65  ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act; ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed; ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee; ● supporting or hosting Family Day events; ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their children’s progress; ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school activities and student progress; ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154. Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers. Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas. 1. 2. 3. 4. High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on the teachers’ performance in classrooms.” 1. Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term workshops and conferences. Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet community needs. 1. These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process. NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional development, and 20% to OTPS.

This after school program will be called EDGE ELL. After analyzing our current data using the RLAT and RMSR reports, as well as the EDAT tool, we identified ELLs that did not make progress in the NYSESLAT (specifically students that did not move across proficiency levels). We also identified ELLs across grades 6, 7 and 8 who scored below a 2 in the NYS Mathematics exams and/or who struggled specifically in the solving of word problems. These participating students are a combination of Entering/Emerging ELLs (years 1-3) and Transitioning/Expanding ELLs (years 4-6), and select GE Immigrant students. Our EDGE ELL program will take place two days a week before school and after school and will focus on the development of the four modalities of language acquisition (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) needed to prepare ELLs for the NYSESLAT, as well as the ELA and the NYS Mathematics assessments. Instruction will be delivered by highly qualified and licensed ENL and Math teachers who have experience teaching ELLs and have received Professional Development in ENL strategies and practices. We are also selecting staff that is knowledgeable in the CCLS and Bilingual Progressions used to set the expectations for our students. We will form six classes (grades 6, 7, and 8) according to student proficiency levels, and 2 classes of Immigrant students who have shown similar needs as our ENL students, and instruction will be differentiated to meet their unique needs. One hour will be allocated to ENL/ELA instruction (delivered by a licensed ENL/ELA teacher) and one hour will be allocated to Mathematics instruction (delivered by a licensed Math teacher) one day a week (2 hours). Math instruction will be delivered within specific grade levels (6-8) using the respective curriculum. <!--{cke_protected}%3Cmeta%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%20%2F%3E-->Program Student grouping and details: * Entering/Emerging ELLs- day 1 (one class on each grade level, 20 students in each class, 2 hours) * Transitioning/Expanding ELLs- day 2 (one class on each grade level, 20 students in each class, 2 hours) * Students will be identified by October 15, 2018 *Program Projected start date: November 7, 2018. * Duration: 41 instructional days * <!--{cke_protected}%3Cmeta%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%20%2F%3E-->Edge ELL will meet Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:40 to 4:40 pm and Wednesdays and Thursdays from 7:05 am to 8:05 am. * Student attendance will be recorded by each teacher for each session with a check off method accompanied by student signature *** There is no other supervisor in the building during the time of the program. Therefore, Title III dollars will be utilized to compensate the ENL administrator for 41 hours. ENL/ELA 2018-19 CEP 71  Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information ENL teachers will use whole group and flexible small group instruction, student-friendly rubrics, guided reading, and scaffolded writing strategies to meet the specific needs of participating students. All students will have their own laptops. For Entering/Emerging students, teachers will use 3 web-based programs: Imagine Learning, IXL and myOn Reading program. These web-based programs are supplemental and distinct from those used for daily instruction. They will work on their phonetic and decoding skills as well as reading comprehension by using Imagine Learning. All programs offer leveled reading materials for students as determined by a lexile assessment. A writing component will be incorporated to provide writing development. Teachers will review, scaffold, and reinforce writing strategies that the students are expected to master during the instructional day. In addition, teachers will use the curriculum Fundamentals Inside Volume 2 from Scholastics. Inside is a middle school program designed for English Language Learners and is fully aligned to the ELA Common Core State Standards. The program at the Fundamentals 2 level offers comprehensive reading, language, and writing support for Entering/Emerging ELLs. Phonemic awareness, phonics, decoding, and spelling are taught sequentially and explicitly through a gradual release model. A focus on language and vocabulary development will provide ELLs with multiple opportunities to increase not only reading and writing skills but language functions and content knowledge. Discussion, oral language, and collaboration opportunities will also help ELLs increase language and vocabulary. The Inside series is content-driven. Each unit is taught thematically, and offers on-page supports, such as visual, glossaries, on-page key vocabulary definitions, and “in other words” explanations. The feature “before you move on” offers comprehension check points. Within the teacher guide, teachers will find differentiated instructional strategies to help a multi-level classroom, as well as explicit teaching. Scaffolded instruction and support is provided for multiple language proficiency levels. The Fundamentals 2 program offers print and web-based resources to support a print, blended learning, or technology based classroom. Teachers will also utilize TEAM Student books in levels C,F, G, and H according to proficiency levels. The focus of the TEAM series is to teach ELLs academic language through the following: · · · · · · · · 8%22%20%2F%3E--> Reading strategies text and questions Writing focus Checks for understanding Discussion prompts grammar Graphic organizers Listening activities (cd)<!--{cke_protected}%3Cmeta%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%20%2F%3E--> The Writing Matters curriculum, Noredink.com, and NewsELA will be used with our Transitioning, Expanding, and Long Term ELLs. Writing Matters is a Common Core-aligned, comprehensive curriculum that uses best practices in writing instruction and that is drawn from extensive research.

The program engages upper elementary and middle school students in the writing process through a series of four to six week units, addressing specific genres. Original content and interactive technology are integrated, helping students develop their writing skills as they generate ideas and topics, organize, compose, revise and publish their work online. The program is paired with comprehensive coaching support which enables teachers to take full advantage of the curriculum and assessments. Lesson plans, available in digital and print formats, include differentiated strategies for beginning, intermediate and experienced writers. The materials described are supplemental and distinct from those used in daily instruction. Newsela is an instructional platform that creates a personal reading experience for students. It contains over 7,000 non-fiction articles that engages readers at five different reading levels, which allows for differentiated instruction. These texts bridge curriculum to the real world. Students complete close reading activities, writing assignments, and take quizzes. Newsela has a student tracking component for teachers to track reading and writing activities, as well as quizzes. Newsela also provides an opportunity for teachers to create discussion questions and projects aligned to nonfiction texts. MATH Eighth grade students will use Algebra Nation. Spanish Bilingual students hear the question in English and watch a video in Spanish. Students answer the questions and the program tracks their progress. The standards for Algebra Regents are directly related to each question that is posed to the students. Students are regrouped after answering the questions. IXL will also be used as a supplemental resource. Math IXL is a web based program that targets math skills aligned to NYS mathematics standards. These skills are organized into categories and vary by grade. Students can preview the skill and complete a skills-based problem. IXL will track individual students’ scores, and the questions will automatically increase in difficulty as students improve. When students get questions wrong, an explanation is generated followed by an opportunity for the student to retry the problem. Lastly, students will utilize Continental Press Finish Line Math CCSS 2nd Edition in all 3 grades. Materials will be purchased in both English and Spanish versions so that students may have both editions available to refer to when working on Math word problems. The work that will be given to students will address all tested Common Core Learning Standards and is aligned to the EngageNY Math Curriculum. It includes practice problems for students per lesson, multiple-choice and open-ended questions for practice, as well as scaffolded practice with items that progress in complexity and rigor. For our Immigrant students, teachers will implement project-based activities to track progress on the units of study provided by the GO Math curriculum which is aligned to the New York Mathematics Common Core Learning Standards.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? We use Mindplay, System 44, Imagine Learning, and myON with our Entering and Emerging ELLs to diagnose whether the student is in need of phonetic interventions, or reading comprehension assistance. With our Transitioning and Expanding ELLs, we continue to use Imagine Learning, Read 180, as well as Achieve3000, NoRedInk, and Snap and Read. These software programs allows us to determine the student's lexile level and assists us in providing instruction using appropriate texts for students, with the goal of differentiating materials and setting expectations. We administer the NYSITELL when the student is registered in our school, and it is used to assess our students' skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. We also use the Fundamentals 1 and 2 (INSIDE) curriculum with Entering and Emerging students to assess their phonetic awareness and decoding skills for ongoing instruction. Within SWD classes, we use assessments provided by the Read 180 and System 44 programs to determine students' reading level and phonetic awareness (program description below) These assessments are used to drive instruction as well as create flexible groups within each class. 2018-19 CEP 78  2. What structures do you have in place to support this effort? ENL coordinator, classroom teachers, and administrators ensure that students are administered the necessary assessments at point of entry (or within 10 days). Then, students are placed in the appropriate class/group according to their proficiency level and academic abilities and are exposed to adequate curricula, materials, and delivery of instruction. 3. What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? In addition to the above mentioned baselines administered at points of entry, we administer MOSL (NYC performance Tasks) at the beginning of the school year to attain a benchmark for each student in Science and Social Studies. We also use a NYSESLAT Sampler assessment, which is given at the end of each quarter, to track progress in the 4 modalities of English acquisition. 4. What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered? Teachers will use the results of the NYSESLAT Sampler to set individual goals for students. Students struggling with the same skills will work together in a group to target that skill. Progress will be assessed with each subsequent NYSESLAT Sampler as well as daily checks for understandings and unit assessments. ENL teachers will focus instruction on reading and writing by increasing the number and quality of read-alouds, shared reading passages, independent reading, focused mini-lessons on reading skills, and various opportunities to improve writing skills. Teachers will assess students through accountable talk, using the SPEAK rubric, to demonstrate their understanding. Writing is taught through modeling, revision of skills, and embedded grammar lessons. 5. How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.] NA 6. What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS]. We use the information from EDAT tool to assess if our students have made progress in their assessments (NYSESLAT, NYS ELA, NYS Math and Regents) . We use this information to review the warning indicators and to inform us about trends in our ELL population, to ensure that the programs that we offer our students align to our needs as a school, and to identify individual goals for students. We use this information to target struggling groups, to address their needs during the school day, and to identify them for supplemental programs as well as select the appropriate materials/curriculum for those programs. 7. What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? At the beginning of each school year, ENL administrator and coordinator review the data available on the EDAT tool, as well as the testing data trends identified for the last 3 years. This information is shared with the ENL department and the entire school community. Then, through the usage of Monday Professional Learning opportunities, as well as weekly meetings with the ENL curriculum team, student work is often evaluated in the form of an inquiry cycle. During those opportunities, the curriculum is adjusted based on data findings and student need. Weekly publications in our school weekly discuss areas of need and findings that have been made and this is shared with the entire school community. Part IV: ELL Programming Programming and Scheduling Information 1. How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in one class]). 2018-19 CEP 79  a. Freestanding ENL program. Middle School 217 currently has a Freestanding ENL program for sixth, seventh and eighth grade students. Our classes are leveled according to students’ English proficiency and ENL status as measured by the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL assessments. Entering students and Emerging students receive 360 minutes (2 units) per week in a stand alone ENL class with a licensed TESOL teacher. Transitioning and Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes (1 unit) of integrated ENL per week. Our Commanding (years 1 and 2) ELLs receive 90 minutes (.5 units) of Integrated ENL per week. Our school ensures that teachers who provide the above units are TESOL licensed teachers. Integrated ENL units are delivered across the content areas, but mostly concentrated during ELA and Social Studies. Below is a more detailed description of how instruction is delivered within our program to different subgroups. b. TBE program. If applicable. NA c. DL program. If applicable. NA 2. How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each program model? a. How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 below)? Our classes are leveled according to students’ English proficiency as measured by the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL assessments. Entering and Emerging students receive 360 minutes (2 units) of stand a lone ENL per week. Transitioning/Expanding and Long-Term ELL students (not commanding) receive 180 minutes per week (I unit of study in ENL) and 8 periods (45 minutes) of ELA instruction. Whenever possible, the ENL integrated instruction takes place during ELA, but also across all content areas. Commanding students receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL instruction (.5 units) . 3. Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards. Our ENL stand alone classes are multicultural and speak various native languages (primarily Spanish, Bengali, and Arabic) ELLs also receive instruction in Math, Social Studies, and Science with licensed content area teachers that implement ENL strategies in their daily instruction. Our school utilizes bilingual staff members to provide native language support for English Language Learners, and for Emerging and Entering students who need the support through the use of oral translations, cognates, translated materials, etc. Math- The Math curriculum used is GO MATH, which offers an engaging and interactive approach to covering Math CCLS. Students can access content digitally at appropriate levels of depth and rigor, and are provided with student workbooks. Teachers incorporate explicit modeling, vocabulary development, hands-on opportunities, and group work. Science- The Science curriculum for MS. 217 is Living Environment-based. This is to ensure that by the time students reach the 8th grade, that they are prepared to take the Living Environment Regents exam. In order to support ELLs and ELL SWDs, teachers incorporate many literacy and ELL-centered strategies within their lessons. For example, SEED charts are tools that create a focus on specific vocabulary, definitions, and allow the student to create sentences or examples to show how they understand the words and content. Venn Diagrams are used to allow students to create models that differentiate and compare certain vocabulary words. Students then create sentences that explain the differences or similarities using connection words like in addition to, dissimilar to, unlike, and as well as, using facts from their Venn Diagrams. Expanding and Commanding ELLs also participate in our school's STEM program. Social Studies- Teacher re-enforce ELA skills through the use of primary sources in order to follow the NYC Scope and Sequence in Social Studies, utilizing the Passport curriculum. In addition, teachers incorporate technology, the use of secondary sources, visuals, videos, and supplementary materials to enrich content. In order to support ELLs and SWDs, teachers incorporate many literacy and ELL-centered strategies within their lessons. For example, SEED charts are tools that create a focus on specific vocabulary, definitions, and allow the student to create sentences or examples to show how they understand the content. Social Studies also bring in ELA strategies into their teaching, such as the RAFFT writing format, when analyzing primary documents. Year 1 and SIFE students whose HL is Spanish will receive 4 weekly units of Bilingual Social Studies. During this time, students will focus on and foster basic writing skills in the home language through Social Studies instruction. 2018-19 CEP 80  ENL Stand alone- (EN, EM)- ENL teachers use INSIDE Fundamentals (National Geographic, Cengage), a curriculum that is providing this specific population with the basic skills they need to acquire the English language, and is aligned to the CCLS. It uses sequential work in phonemic awareness, phonics, and decoding, which are the most basic skills that students need to understand and read English. It then progresses to foundational work in reading comprehension, vocabulary, language, writing, and spelling. Teachers also continue to build academic vocabulary and language and fluency with more complex texts and develop skills in comprehension, literary analysis and writing. However, the basic foundations are taught first. Teachers also utilize System 44, Mindplay, and Imagine Learning. ENL/ELA Integrated Instruction TR,EX)- Expeditionary Learning (EL) is the curriculum that is used. It connects learning to real-world issues and themes. Academically rigorous learning expeditions, case studies, projects, fieldwork, and service-learning inspire students to think and work as professionals do. Students have access to a rigorous curriculum and assignments. EL gives an opportunity for discovery, inquiry, critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration. Teachers talk less, giving the students the opportunity to talk and think more. Lessons have an explicit purpose, guided by learning targets for which students take ownership and responsibility. Teachers also utilize Read 180, Imagine Learning, myON, Achieve 3000, and NoRedInk. In all subject areas, teachers differentiate instruction and maintain high expectations in order to bring out the best in all students and cultivate a culture of high achievement. ENL teachers make adaptations and differentiate to facilitate learning and understanding by using strategies and scaffolds such as pre-selecting and teaching key vocabulary and concepts, chunking or parsing text, paraphrasing, the use of graphic organizers, and incorporating visual aides though the use of technology. ENL teachers provide content area support for ELLS by: • Vocabulary development- Tier II words ( that are not explicitly taught during the lesson) as well as academic vocabulary • Small group instruction on a specific task relevant to the lesson • Incorporation of ENL strategies to facilitate understanding of the content • Using the SPEAK rubric with table groups to asses understanding and promote meaningful discussions • Provide scaffolding tools, such as graphic organizers, to BREAK DOWN not WATER DOWN the content • Provide Language objectives in every lesson 4. How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? All city and state exams are available in the students home language (except for ELA exams, reading exams, or writing exams) In addition, glossaries in the student's home language is provided for the students to use during in house exams in all content areas. Oral translations are provided in the event that a written translation is not available in a particular language. 5. How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? SIFE a. b. Newcomer c. Developing d. e. Long Term Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status SIFE Students SIFE students receive 360 minutes of ENL stand alone instruction to provide them with fundamental reading and writing skills. Their teachers use differentiated instruction to meet their needs and provide native language support whenever possible through oral translations and materials in their native language to scaffold and support their learning. SIFE students are highly encouraged to attend the Title III (EDGE/ELL) extended-school program and/or Saturday Academy which focuses on mathematics and English language development. They can receive the support they need to perform well and make progress on the state examinations. In addition, we are forming a SIFE Spanish-speaking bridge classroom for 7th and 8th grade students in Social Studies. SIFE students whose HL is Spanish will receive 4 weekly units of Bilingual Social Studies. During this time, students will focus on and foster basic writing skills in the home language through Social Studies instruction. Newcomer ELLs Newcomer ELLs, are placed in an Entering/Emerging ENL class. They receive 360 minutes of intensive stand alone ENL instruction per week by a licensed TESOL teacher, as well as 180 minutes of ENL/content area instruction. Technology, visual aids, and hands-on opportunities are integrated into all lessons. Inside Fundamentals 1 and 2 are used as a base curriculum, as 2018-19 CEP 81  well Mindplay, Imagine Learning, and Read 180. Middle School 217 offers a variety of supplemental programs for this subgroup. These programs provide instructional assistance primarily in Literacy and Mathematics- Saturday Academy, TITLE III extended day program (EDGE ELL) and ENL Summer Academy. Newcomers are mandated to attend our ENL Saturday Academy and/or EDGE ELL Day program. Special visual aids, alternate classroom libraries, Mindplay online software, System 44 , as well as Imagine Learning are available as aides for this subgroup. Developing ELLs ELLs in this category receive 180 minutes of ENL/ELA instruction. Teachers instruct these students using the Expeditionary Learning curriculum as well as alternate texts sets to scaffold learning and provide additional support. ELLs are often grouped together according to similar needs. The explicit teaching of academic vocabulary is a major focus. Teachers use a variety of skills to teach vocabulary and give students ample opportunities to use academic language (ExC-ELL method). Students use technology to complete projects using Powerpoint, iMovies, and Excel. Online software such as myON, Imagine Learning, Achieve 3000, Read 180, and NoRedInk are utilized with this subgroups. Long Term ELLs Long Term ELLs receive 1 unit of integrated ENL/ELA (180 minutes) per week. During this instructional time, they will receive intensive vocabulary and reading comprehension strategies supported by a licensed TESOL teacher. In addition, all content area teachers who service Long Term ELLs will be trained in ExC-ELL vocabulary and writing strategies. During these Professional Learning opportunities, teachers will learn how to teach vocabulary within context, academic vocabulary, and how to choose words that will carry across disciplines for instruction. In addition, teachers will learn how to apply writing techniques and strategies that are specific for students who are in need of this support. Long Term ELLs will be targeted specifically for supplementary intervention services, such as the EDGE/ELL afterschool program and Saturday Academy. Here, ENL teachers will focus on accelerating students’ progress towards attaining English proficiency and closing academic gaps, recognizing their distinct needs. Students will be provided with a program that focuses on language development, literacy development, addresses the academic gaps, affirms the role of home language in a student’s life and learning, and keeps them actively engaged. These students will continue to use Expeditionary Learning as a curriculum, embedding scaffolds and opportunities for differentiation to facilitate understanding. With this subgroups, we will implement the Academic Vocabulary Toolkit (AVT) program by Dr. Kate Kinsella. The AVT program is a NYC Department of Education recommended program. The program tackles Tier II words, also known as “high-frequency words for mature language users —such as coincidence, absurd, industrious — for which instruction can add productively to an individual's language ability” (Beck, et al, 2002). Because Tier II words are often used across disciplines, they usually are polysemous and abstract words that cannot be easily explained through a visual aid e.g. interpret, analyze, express. These words present a barrier for many of our mid-year and long-term ELLs and therefore require explicit instruction coupled with escalated guided practice as modeled in the AVT program. The AVT program includes an extensive list of Tier II words aligned to Common Core, each of which is presented with word families (e.g. analyze and analysis) and grammar and syntax targets to help students become agile readers, speakers, and writers. The words can be taught in any order to correlate with cross-curricular needs. The escalated guided practice compels students to activate other best practices in vocabulary instruction (e.g. identifying connotation and context clues) and provides writing opportunities for students to apply the new words they have acquired. Commanding (Former ELLs up to 2 years after exiting ELL status) Former/ Commanding ELLs (years 1 and 2) are placed in a General Education class and receive .5 units of integrated ENL/ELA delivered by an ELA licensed teacher with a TESOL certified teacher pushing in. The follow the Expeditionary Learning curriculum. Commanding ELLs are highly encouraged to attend the AIS extended-day programs offered by the school, as well as Saturday Academy and the EDGE/ELL program. 6. What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development? Delivery of services- We have self-contained Special Education ELL classes. A dually certified teacher provides instruction for this group (Special Education/ENL). ELLs who are in other Special Education classes receive integrated ELA/ENL. According to their IEP indications, some Special Education ELLs travel with a language paraprofessional at all times. Teachers use flexible grouping 2018-19 CEP 82  strategies to group the students according to ability, proficiency levels, NYSESLAT modality, and progression of activities. Special Education students set goals with the teacher to target their specific needs. Teachers assess their progress via assessments, projects, individualized activities, and portfolios. Two web based programs have been incorporated with our self-contained ENL Special Education population; System 44 and Read 180. Read 180 is a blended learning intervention program that builds reading comprehension, academic vocabulary, and writing skills for struggling students. Read 180 features a flexible rotation model designed to help teachers address students at all levels of intervention. Teachers facilitate instruction to the whole group with close-reading strategies, academic vocabulary exercises, practice writing, and engaging discussions with the entire class. During the rotations, students are divided into flexible groups as follows: 1. Student application- Students work independently using the Student App that follow a personalized path that enhances their learning experience. 2. Independent Reading- students have a choice of content rich texts to which they can apply their newly acquired vocabulary and comprehension skills. 3. Small group learning-students receive targeted data-driven instruction unique to their individual learning needs while building meaningful relationships with the ENL and content area teacher. System 44 is a new foundational reading program for the most challenged readers in Grades 3–12+. It is designed to help students master the foundational reading skills required for success with the new standards, college and career readiness, through explicit instruction in phonics, comprehension, and writing. It combines adaptive technology and teacher-led instruction to help students become proficient readers, writers, speakers, and critical thinkers. Learning provides a simple and clear organization for instruction and classroom engagement, and gets ALL students reading, writing, talking, and thinking critically every day. System 44 was developed as a system of professional development to support teachers and leaders in elevating their practice- helping them move from good to great. It helps these struggling readers to see a path to college and career for themselves through instruction and content that is respectful and engaging. In addition to these two programs, we also incorporate the WIlson Reading Intervention program and Wilson Rewards with our most struggling ELLs. This intervention takes place during class time (in small groups, and by licensed, trained teachers) and before and after school during AIS programs. Use of technology- Use of SmartBoards to deliver lessons using interactive tools and visuals, as well as streaming videos, and Google docs and Google classroom to present and gather information from the the students. Every student has access to laptops at all times. The number of units of ENL instruction is determined by their most recent NYSESLAT scores. Testing accommodations are granted to individual students as determined by the IEPs. Some students travel from class to class with a language paraprofessional, who provides support in the student’s native language, if indicated by his/her IEP. Native Language books as well as Word to Word Dictionaries in SP, AR and BG can be found in the classroom library. Other technological resources to support ELL-SWDs include: Google translate, Brainpop, Discovery Education, Kahoot, myON, Imagine Learning, NoRedInk, and Achieve 3000. The Special Education Department meets on a monthly basis to review students’ IEP and the School Compliance Report to ensure that students are receiving all the mandates on their IEPs. Also the ENL provider records the first attend date on SESIS. 7. How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? Entering and Emerging ELL SWD students receive instruction from a teacher who holds both a Special Education license as well as a TESOL license. Integrated ENL is provided for SWDs in self-contained classes with students that are Transitioning, and Advanced, in which the ENL teacher and the content area teacher work together to maximize students' learning and provide differentiated instruction to meet the needs of the students. Teachers plan and prepare together to include ENL and 2018-19 CEP 83  vocabulary strategies in the lessons. ENL teachers use SESIS to view student's IEP information and goals. We place students as per the recommendations in their IEPs. We place the ELL-SWDs in an ICT class that has a dually-certified teacher so that students remain with their peers and are not pulled out during core content instruction. Students who require 12:1 OR 12:1:1 are also instructed by a dually certified teacher (TESOL/ELA). 8. Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups targeted). List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which they are offered. Our goal is to empower ELLs to acquire the listening, speaking, reading and writing skills they need to become proficient speakers of English. We, as educators, provide students with the tools they need to achieve this goal by implementing various instructional programs and strategies. In the Transitioning/Expanding and Commanding ENL classrooms, an enriching ELA program is offered, Expeditionary Learning (EL), which includes read-alouds, author studies, independent reading choices, and writing workshops. Students work with task-specific rubrics which are maintained in students’ portfolios. The integration of ENL strategies and methodology with technology is evident during all parts of the lesson and teachers address the specific needs of our ELLs through flexible grouping and differentiated instruction during student-centered parts of the lesson. EL is aligned to the New York State ENL progressions and standards and common core standards for English Language Arts. It follows pacing guidelines with various themes and essential questions that give the students opportunities to make connections to the world and themselves as well as share their cultural backgrounds. Teacher teams continuously work together to design and differentiate lessons to meet the new Common Core Standards utilizing the UBD (Understanding by Design) model for our ELL subgroups. ENL teachers and other subject area teachers utilize research-based strategies such as Total Physical Response, explicit vocabulary development, ExC-ELL strategies, RIGOR (for emerging students), and the Danielson Framework for Teaching. In addition, there is ongoing articulation between the teachers to reinforce concepts taught in subject areas. The Mindplay reading program, System 44, Imagine Learning and Fundamentals 1 and 2 are used by Entering/Emerging ELLs. Mindplay, System 44, and Imagine Learning are web- based programs. The myON reading program, Imagine Learning, Achieve 3000 program, Read 180, and NoRedInk is used by Transitioning/Expanding/Commanding ELLs. Achieve 3000 provides a web-based, individualized learning program with vocabulary development, reading comprehension, and writing components. Students are administered a pre-assessment that determines their individual lexile levels and generates readings at their level. It uses accepted and proven benchmarks for assessments and instruction from the lexile framework to the principles of Bloom's Taxonomy. The content is non-fiction, high-interest articles customized to the students’ individual lexile level. This provides differentiation of content for our ELLs. It provides high-interest non-fiction texts in a variety of topics. Writing instruction provides differentiated writing lessons using baseline assessments, visuals, graphic organizers, animations and a variety of mentor texts to support students through the Writing Process. The texts that are used are at different reading levels so that instruction can be differentiated among ELLs of different English Proficiencies and grade levels. Our ELL self-contained classes and push-in classes are grouped according to English proficiency as per their most recent NYSESLAT scores and differentiated instruction takes place within these groups as well. ELLs are taught a variety of computer skills and programs such as Microsoft Office Suite, PowerPoint, I-documentaries, Writing Process, Brainpop. myON, Mindplay, Imagine Learning, System 44, Read 180, NoRedInk, Achieve 3000, and iVideo. There are increased opportunities for hands-on instruction in Math, Science and Social Studies and increased shared reading and writing during the ELA/ENL periods. Content area and ENL teachers differentiate instruction through the use of flexible grouping, goal setting, alternate texts and scaffolding strategies. Teachers use PowerPoint, Smart Boards and Smart Notebooks to deliver lessons. All ENL classes are provided with multilevel classroom libraries in a variety of genres. These books are utilized on a daily basis for independent reading, read-alouds, and shared reading. We have recently expanded our libraries and offer books in Spanish and Bengali as well. Our school has extensive materials on teaching practical English skills, as well as skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing. Class sets of interesting adapted novels are used with Emerging/Transitioning/Expanding/Commanding ELLs. Audio books and visual aides are used to facilitate the learning of 2018-19 CEP 84  Entering ELLs and SIFE students. As mentioned above, ENL teachers use The Achieve 3000 program. Achieve 3000 provides a web-based, individualized learning program with vocabulary development, reading comprehension, and writing components. The content is non-fiction, high-interest articles customized to the students’ individual lexile level, as determined by a pre-assessment. This provides differentiation of content for our ELLs. Math teachers use Go Math, along with teacher-created lessons that aligned to the Common Core State Standards for Math, and test preparation materials specific to each grade. Science teachers follow the NYC science curriculum with a regents-bound course, and they utilize New York State Lessons which are focused on higher learning skills, multi-step problem solving and inquiry-based projects. ELLs also have access to our state of the art science laboratory. There are sets of kits and materials that allow opportunity for hands-on activities and experimentation. E-science is also used through Achieve 3000, a web-based program. Students access science articles that are matched to their individual lexile levels. Social Studies teachers use primary sources, as well as alternate text sets, that are aligned with the New York State Standards and follow a specific curriculum and pacing calendar in each grade (Passport to Social Studies) Charts, word walls, visual aides, explicit teaching of vocabulary, opportunities to read and write, technology, and hands-on materials are incorporated in all lessons. Every year, a different group of content area teachers that work with ELLs receive ExC-ELL training. In addition to receiving professional development during these sessions, teachers also work together to create, enhance, and differentiate lessons to fit the needs of their ELLs. Native language support is used in the ENL class, as well as the content areas, particularly with Entering and SIFE students, by providing oral translations and books/materials in the native language (if available). Presently, we do not offer language electives to ELLs. This year, we will also offer SIFE Spanish speaking students a bridge class (7th/8th grade) in Social Studies with a thematic based curriculum. When programming and placing students, we group Entering ELLs together and provide them with 8 periods of stand alone English instruction, with native language support form staff members whenever possible. In addition, the Emerging students will receive 4 periods of stand alone English instruction and/or Integrated ENL instruction. Transitioning and Expanding students will receive 4 periods of Integrated ENL instruction, and Commanding students will receive 2 periods a week of ENL instruction via the push in model. Instruction will be delivered by an ENL licensed teacher (periods are 45 minutes long in our school). All materials and texts used in the ENL classroom and in the content area classroom are at the students' grade levels with the support of alternate text sets to support grade-level materials. Academic language is always addressed during the pre and post teaching phases as well as during the readings. The Achieve 3000 program described above makes it possible for ELLs to work with grade level non-fiction articles tailored to their individual lexile levels. Targeted Intervention Programs for ELLs (Supplemental) ENL/Math Summer Academy- ELLs attend Summer School for 5 weeks and receive targeted ENL and Math instruction using technology, Writing Matters, and Achieve 3000. Every June, ENL administrator identifies students and compiles a plan for the ENL Summer Academy, according to student levels and special needs. Students also have an opportunity to work on thematic units and go on a corresponding class trip. Edge ELL (see full description below on question 11) Wilson Instruction- SWD, SIFE and 0-3 years ELLs receive instruction with a licensed Reading teacher trained in the Wilson program that delivers specific instruction to beginner readers. Instruction takes place 2 times a week for 2 hours afterschool. *ELLs also have access to the instructional and extracurricular supplemental programs offered in our school such as ELA/Math Saturday Academy, EDGE/ELL afterschool program, and the Queens Community House After School Program. ELL Subgroups (Instruction and Intervention) Special Education (SWD) We will have an ENL ICT class and self contained SWD (with current and commanding ELLs) classes on every grade level. In the 2018-19 CEP 85  ICT classes, ENL services are provided by the co-teacher, who is TESOL licensed. For the self-contained classes, integrated ENL services are provided, in which the ENL teacher and the content area teacher work together to maximize students' learning and provide differentiated instruction to meet the needs of the students, and by a special education teacher who holds a TESOL license. According to IEP indications, some Special Education ELLs travel with a language paraprofessional at all times. Teachers provide differentiated instruction for these students using the tools and strategies mentioned above. Teachers use flexible grouping strategies to group the students according to ability, proficiency levels, NYSESLAT modality, and progression of activities. Special Education students set goals with the teacher to target their specific needs. Teachers assess their progress via assessments, projects, individualized activities, and portfolios. In addition, Middle School 217 offers a Saturday School Academy, afterschool EDGE ELL program, and TITLE III Summer Academy programs. These programs provide instructional assistance in ENL/ELA, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies. Special Education students are highly encouraged to attend our Saturday Academy and/or EDGE ELL program, which provides additional support for ELLs to improve their Mathematics and ENL skills and prepare them for NYS examinations. SIFE Students Our plan is to develop a bilingual Spanish-English Social Studies bridge class for the 7th and 8th grade Spanish-speaking SIFE students utilizing a thematic-based curriculum. (Research supports this approach: While remedial instruction may be necessary, native-language instruction and sheltered instruction may provide a viable alternative to remedial instruction (Spaulding, Carolino & Amen, 2004). Schools may also consider using thematic curriculum, individual learning plans, or alternative ways of gaining course credit (such as an independent study or an internship) (Walsh, 1991, as cited in Office of English Language Learning & Migrant Education). Implementation and delivery of Instruction: 9. Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year? NYS data showed a decrease in math scores within the ELL population. In order to improve ELL student performance and increase student engagement in Math, we are incorporating the Mathletics program. This program enhances learning by providing and online tool that provides adaptive practice targeted to a student's level. It increases difficulty level over time, once students improve or master a skill. It has built-in motivators. It assigns targeted activities (after a pre-assessment) and provides interactive support. It provides visual and audio support for ELLs and immediate feedback so students can self-correct and self-reflect. We will continue but enhance our ARTS for ELLs program through our partnership with the Queens Museum. This year, we will focus on the Tiffany exhibit and relate it to the topic of Immigration. Students will work with an on-site artist to create original pieces and display them at the end of the year in a culminating trip to the Queens Museum. 10. If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? NA 11. How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs? Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in your building. Targeted Intervention Programs for ELLs (Supplemental) EDGE/ELL extended afterschool program (TITLE III) Although we focus on targeted groups, we still invite all ELLs and encouraged to participate in our EDGE/ELL after-school program. In this program, licensed ENL and Math teachers provide supplemental support during afterschool hours 2 times a week. The program focuses on improving ELLs' skills in Mathematics across grade levels and ENL instruction in preparation for the NYSESLAT and the NYS ELA exam. Ready books, project-based activities, NYSESLAT preparation materials, and the Achieve 3000 program are used during this time. myON and Imagine Learning will be used for Entering students. ENL/Math Summer Academy- ELLs attend summer school for 5 weeks and receive targeted ENL, Math, and Science instruction using technology, Writing Matters, and Achieve 3000. Science instruction will be a specific preparation for these ELL students to take the Regents exam. 2018-19 CEP 86  Every June, the school puts together a plan for the ENL Summer Academy according to student levels and special needs. Students also have an opportunity to work on thematic units and go on a corresponding class trip. Wilson Instruction- SWD, SIFE and 0-3 years ELLs receive instruction with a licensed Reading teacher trained in the Wilson program that delivers specific instruction to beginner readers. Instruction takes place 2 days a week for 2 hours afterschool. *ELLs also have access to the instructional and extracurricular supplemental programs offered in our school such as ELA/Math Saturday Academy and the Queens Community House After School Program. ELA/Math Saturday Academy students will receive supplemental instruction in ELA, ENL, and Math, using NYSESLAT preparation materials, Writing Matters program, and Achieve 3000 (with a targeted focus) Students are invited to participate in the above programs by providing them with letters in the parents’ preferred languages requiring their signed permission. A notice is also posted on PupilPath so that parents receive the information in multiple formats. Usually, our students have 90% attendance for this program and attendance recorded are kept on file. Our school also includes all ELLs to participate in extra-curricular activities and clubs such as soccer, wrestling, drama, step class, heart surgery program, Robotics and the Green Magnet Environmental Club. 12. What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. ENL teachers and other subject area teachers utilize research-based strategies such as Total Physical Response, explicit vocabulary development, ExC-ELL strategies, and the Danielson Framework for Teaching. In addition, there is ongoing articulation between the teachers to reinforce concepts taught in subject areas. Mindplay, System 44, and Imagine Learning reading program are used by Entering/Emerging ELLs. All programs are web-based. For Transitioning/Expanding ELLs, the Achieve 3000 program is used, as well as Read 180, Imagine Learning, myON, and NoRedInk. Achieve 3000 provides a web-based, individualized learning program with vocabulary development, reading comprehension, and writing components. Students are administered a pre-assessment that determines their individual lexile levels and generates readings at their level. It uses accepted and proven benchmarks for assessments and instruction from the lexile framework to the principles of Bloom's Taxonomy. The content is non-fiction, high-interest articles, customized to the students’ individual lexile level. This provides differentiation of content for our ELLs.

These books are utilized on a daily basis for independent reading, read-alouds, and shared reading. We offer books in Spanish and Bengali as well. Library books are also available in the main 3 home languages at our school (Spanish, Bengali, and Arabic) Our school has extensive materials on teaching practical English skills, as well as skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing. Class sets of interesting adapted novels are used with Emerging/Transitioning/Expanding/Commanding ELLs. Audio books and visual aides are used to facilitate the learning of Entering ELLs and SIFE students. As mentioned above, ENL teachers use The Achieve 3000 program. Achieve 3000 provides a web-based, individualized learning program with vocabulary development, reading comprehension, and writing components. The content is non-fiction high-interest articles customized to the students’ individual lexile level, as determined by a pre-assessment. This provides differentiation of content for our ELLs. Math teachers use Go Math, along with teacher-created lessons that are aligned to the Common Core State Standards for 2018-19 CEP 87  Math, and test preparation materials specific to each grade. Science teachers follow the NYC science curriculum plan that is regents-bound, and utilize New York State lessons that are focused on higher learning skills, multi-step problem, solving and inquiry-based projects. ELLs also have access to our state of the art science laboratory. There are sets of kits and materials that allow opportunity for hands-on activities and experimentation. E-science is also used through Achieve 3000, a web-based program. Students access science articles that are matched to their individual lexile levels.

Charts, word walls, visual aides, explicit teaching of vocabulary, opportunities to read and write, technology, and hands-on materials are incorporated in all lessons. Every year, a different group of content area teachers that work with ELLs receive ExC-ELL training. In addition to receiving professional development during these sessions, teachers also work together to create, enhance, and differentiate lessons to fit the needs of their ELLs. Native language support is used in the ENL class, as well as the content area classroom, particularly with Entering/Emerging and SIFE students, by providing oral translations and books in the native language (if available). Presently, we do not offer language electives to ELLs. ELL Subgroups (Instruction and Intervention) Special Education (SWD) SWD students receive ENL instruction (Stand alone and Integrated), as described above. According to IEP indications, some Special Education ELLs travel with a language paraprofessional at all times. Teachers provide differentiated instruction for these students using the tools and strategies mentioned above. Teachers use flexible grouping strategies to group the students according to ability, proficiency levels, NYSESLAT modality, and progression of activities. Special Education students set goals with the teacher to target their specific needs. Teachers assess their progress via assessments, projects, individualized activities, and portfolios. In addition, Middle School 217 offers a Saturday School Academy, afterschool EDGE ELL program, and TITLE III Summer Academy program. These programs provide instructional assistance in ENL, ELA, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies. Special Education students are highly encouraged to attend our Saturday Academy and/or EDGE ELL program, which provides additional support for ELLs to improve their Mathematics and ENL skills and prepare them for NYS examinations. SIFE Students SIFE students receive 4 units of ENL (stand alone model). Teachers use differentiated instruction to meet their needs and provide native language support whenever possible through oral translations and materials in their native language to scaffold and support their learning. SIFE students are highly encouraged to attend the Title III (EDGE/ELL) afterschool program and/or Saturday school which focuses on Mathematics and English language development. They can receive the support they need to perform well and make progress on the state examinations. Entering ELLs (less than three years) Entering ELLs, as determined by NYSITELL and NYSESLAT assessments, are placed in an Entering ENL class. They receive 4 units of intensive stand alone ENL instruction per week by a licensed ENL teacher, as well as 180 minutes of ENL/content area instruction. Technology, visual aids, and hands-on opportunities are integrated into all lessons. Inside Fundamentals 1 and 2 is used as a base curriculum. Inside is middle school program designed for English Language Learners and fully aligned to the ELA Common Core State Standards. The program at the Fundamentals 1 and Fundamentals 2 level offers comprehensive reading, language, and writing support for Entering and SIFE students. Phonemic awareness, phonics, decoding, and spelling are taught sequentially and explicitly through a gradual release model. A focus on language and vocabulary development will provide ELLs with multiple opportunities to increase not only reading and writing skills but language functions and content knowledge. Discussion, oral language, and collaboration opportunities will also help ELLs increase language and vocabulary. The Inside series is content-driven. Each unit is taught thematically, and offers on-page supports as visual glossaries, on-page key vocabulary definitions, and “in other words”. “Before you move on” offers comprehension check points. Within the teacher guide, teachers will find differentiated instructional strategies to help a multi-level classroom, as well as explicit teaching. Scaffolded instruction and support is provided for multiple language proficiency levels. The Inside program offers print and web-based resources to support a print, blended learning, or technology-based classroom. With this subgroup of 2018-19 CEP 88  students, we Imagine Learning, Mindplay, and System 44. Middle School 217 offers a variety of supplemental programs for this subgroup. These programs provide instructional assistance primarily in Literacy and Mathematics- Saturday Academy, TITLE III extended day program (EDGE ELL) and ENL Summer Academy. Newcomers are mandated to attend our ENL Saturday Academy and/or EDGE ELL Day program. Special visual aids, alternate classroom libraries, and the above-mentioned web-based programs are available. Transitioning/Expanding students ELLs in this category receive 4 units of integrated ENL instruction, within the content areas, particularly ELA. Teachers instruct these students using the Expeditionary Learning curriculum as well as alternate texts sets to scaffold learning and provide additional support. ELLs are often grouped together according to similar needs. The explicit teaching of academic vocabulary is a major focus. Teachers use a variety of skills to teach vocabulary and give students ample opportunities to use academic language (ExC-ELL method). Students use technology to complete projects using Powerpoint, iMovies, and Excel. The Achieve 3000 program (described above) is used two to three times a week with this particular group of students. Other web-based programs include Read 180, Imagine Learning, NoRedInk, and myON. Long Term ELLs will be targeted specifically for supplementary intervention services, such as the EDGE/ELL afterschool program and Saturday school. Here, ENL teachers will focus on accelerating students’ progress towards attaining English proficiency and closing academic gaps, recognizing their distinct needs. Students will be provided with a program that focuses on language development, literacy development, addresses the academic gaps, affirms the role of home language in a student’s life and learning, and keeps them actively engaged. These students will continue to use Expeditionary Learning as a curriculum, embedding scaffolds and opportunities for differentiation to facilitate understanding. We will implement the Academic Vocabulary Toolkit (AVT) program by Dr. Kate Kinsella with Long Term ELLs. The AVT program is a NYC Department of Education recommended program. The program tackles Tier II words, also known as “high-frequency words for mature language users." Because Tier II words are often used across disciplines, they usually are polysemous and abstract words that cannot be easily explained through a visual aid (e.g. interpret, analyze, express). These words present a barrier for many of our mid-year and long-term ELLs and therefore, require explicit instruction coupled with escalated guided practice as modeled in the AVT program. The AVT program includes an extensive list of Tier II words aligned to Common Core, each of which is presented with word families (e.g. analyze and analysis) and grammar and syntax targets to help students become agile readers, speakers, and writers. The words can be taught in any order to correlate with cross-curricular needs. The escalated guided practice compels students to activate other best practices in vocabulary instruction (e.g. identifying connotation and context clues) and provides writing opportunities for students to apply the new words they have acquired. Long Term ELLs will be programmed for Achieve 3000 as an extra 45 minute block above the mandated units. this class will be taught by an ENL teacher and will focus on vocabulary and reading comprehension. We are implementing specific instructional strategies in reading and writing, with a careful eye on our ELL population. We propose a 3 day instructional plan that will be implemented by Social Studies teachers 4 times within a quarter. We will meet with Social Studies teachers weekly to review student work, notice trends, make decisions on strategies, and track student progress. As the short term goals are met, new goals based on student data will be set. A vocabulary inventory with previously selected Tier II words (can be used as baseline and for grouping) will be administered. There will be explicit teaching of Tier II words using graphic organizers, student friendly definitions, examples, and guided interactions. Students will read the primary source aloud 1 time, where they will begin to get the “gist” of the document. There will be a second reading of the primary source, this time introducing a HOW question the students will keep in mind. Teachers will select a literary skill that students must learn during the day’s lesson and select quotes that are an example of that literary skill. Teachers will model RAFFT, a writing strategy, using a previously learned primary source. Students will then apply the strategy, using the primary source they have been working with, and answering the HOW question from the day before. Students are given the vocabulary inventory again (at the end of the unit) as an assessment. Students’ RAFFT paragraphs are graded using a uniformed rubric. 13. How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? Native language support is provided to Entering ELLs when necessary, via student grouping (by language) and the use of Bilingual teachers support (Spanish, French). All NYS exams are available in native language or a translator is provided (when 2018-19 CEP 89  and where applicable and requested) ENL libraries contain books in our two major languages- Bengali and Spanish. 14. Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels. ELLs are placed in a specific grade according to their age (unless the student is a holdover), and grade level curricula is used across content areas for all grades. Another consideration for student placement is their score on the NYSITELL upon entering our school. During ENL stand-alone and integrated ENL, special strategies and support materials are used in conjunction with grade level curricula. During stand alone ENL with Entering/Emerging students only, the INSIDE Fundamentals 1 and 2 curriculum is used during year 1. Expeditionary Learning is utilized for Transitioning/Expanding students. In addition, the above named web-based programs are also available. 15. If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met? NA 16. Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, parent coordinator). ELLs and their parents are invited to an informative session during Open School night which usually takes place during the 2nd or 3rd week of September. At this time, the ELL teachers describe the ENL program, students expectations, after school activities and programs that are and will become available, and parent/family resources in the school and community. Through the school's Translation/Interpretation budget, the information is provided in various languages. Prior to the beginning of the school year, ENL staff and administrators meet to analyze and NYSESLAT data to level and from groups of students according to proficiency level. We also administer the NYSITELL and provide parent orientations for students that register the week before school reopens. Upon registration, a newcomer student will view student-created informational videos in their preferred language that is meant to inform the student of all that they need to know in order to navigate the school during their first few weeks - understanding how to read a student schedule, understanding how ENL classes are structured and how students will learn English, understanding the rules and routines of the school, how to obtain a school ID, uniform policy and logistics, access to gmail and google classroom, transportation, role of supporting staff in our school, obtaining supplies and materials for each of the classes, Pupilpath, etc. 17. What language electives are offered to ELLs? At this time, language electives are not offered to ELLs. However we offer the following elective for ELLs: Dance Chorus Band Computer Green Magnet Production Company: Sustainability Visual Art 18. For schools with dual language programs: a. What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. In which language(s) is each core content area taught? b. c. How is each language separated for instruction? d. Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same time (simultaneous)? NA 2018-19 CEP 90  Professional Development and Support for School Staff 1. Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic staff.) What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? Professional development takes place during common preparation periods, weekly departmental planning time, professional learning meetings, lunch and learns, during work hours, and during the summer time. Our principal and assistant principal provide opportunities for ELL, content area, special education teachers, and paraprofessionals to attend professional development in our school and throughout our city. Inter-visitations between teachers and helpful strategies are modeled by coaches and experienced teachers are also part of our professional development plan. Below is a list of our Professional Development focuses: 2. Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance). Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Professional Development section. Exc-ELL 3 day institute: This program provides strategies in vocabulary, reading and writing across all contents areas, ENL, and Special Education- This is a full day professional development series conducted over 3 school days. At this time, 75% of our teachers have received this PD. We continue to offer it every year with a goal of 100% of our teachers to be trained. This PD meets the 7.5 hours of ELL training for staff members. Records are kept through sign-in sheets, agendas, and samples of activities completed. We also include a day where the facilitator comes into the classrooms and works hand in hand with the teachers and students to enhance instruction and provide useful feedback. Parental Involvement 1. How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences? Our school will provide parents annual and individual meetings to discuss their child’s progress every Tuesday. During these weekly and annual and individual meetings, the ENL goals will be discussed, the language development progress of the student, assessment results, and needs. There parent meetings that are held every Tuesday are built into our school day, during a 50 minute block either before or after school. Sign-in sheets and agendas will be provided and kept in the office of the AP in charge of ENL. All parent letters and official documents provided will be translated in the parents' requested language and an interpreter will be present for all official meetings throughout the school year. 2. Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. Our school will provide various workshops, meetings, and informational sessions for parents, including parents of ELLs. Translations will be provided orally and with the use devices (supported by our Translation/interpretation Unit). In order to encourage parent involvement, our school will provide the following workshops and meetings: • Parent information sessions on NY State Exams in the Content Areas • Back to School Night • Math and ELA Test Preparation Tips • How to Choose a High School for your Child- High School information sessions for grade 8 parents • PTA Monthly Meetings 2018-19 CEP 91  • Talking to Your Teen about Healthy Relationships • Parent Teacher Conferences • Family STEM Night • Family Fun ELA Night • Family Social Studies Cultural Night * Pupilpath- Monthly workshops * ELL Family Night (Fall, Winter, Spring sessions) Additional Information Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL Policy and Reference Guide, I, Patrick Michael Burns, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 1. The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for students entering with IEPs). Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined a. If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level. The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue. a. The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality translation service. Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined. a. If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible. Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language. a. Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish LAB. Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-education-sife. If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting. a. Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided throughout the meeting. 10. ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected. a. b. If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program in accordance with DOE transfer policies. If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice. 11. Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process). 12.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's Regulation A-663). By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). Part A: Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 1. Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)  Automate The System (ATS) reports  Student Emergency Contact cards  Surveys conducted by your school. Our school distributes a parent survey in September of every year school year, asking parents in which language they prefer to receive information. These surveys assist us in determining the preferred language to disseminate information regarding school information, curriculum information, meetings and events. In addition, all registered students fill out mandatory emergency blue cards that indicate in which language they would prefer to receive oral and written notifications from the school. In addition, the HLIS helps us to further identify the languages in which parents prefer to receive information, and we use that information when we determine into which language documents should be translated. Lastly, during our first Parent-Teacher conference that is held in September, parents are surveyed as to which language they prefer. 2018-19 CEP 95  2.
