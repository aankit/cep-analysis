This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The Science and Medicine Middle School uses health and medicine as a lens through which students learn core  academic subjects, including mathematics, science, social studies and English Language Arts. SMMS 366 equips  students with the knowledge and skills to manage their own health and well being, advocate for community members,  and pursue post high school education that may prepare them for careers related to health and wellness.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   The Science and Medicine Middle School 366 is committed to providing a safe and nurturing yet academically rigorous  learning environment that prepares students for high school, college, careers, and service to the world. It is our  expectation that students respect themselves and others, hold themselves accountable for their actions, and always  strive for excellence. Serving the Canarsie and East Flatbush communities of District 18, we offer a comprehensive  academic program with an emphasis in the sciences, and in particular, the medical sciences. Currently, we have 395  students in grades six through eight. Among those, approximately 2% are English Language Learners and 21% have  Individualized Educational Plans. Additionally, our ethnic breakdown is as follows: 89% Black, 7% Latino, 2% White and  1% other.       Through our partnerships with community organizations, universities, hospitals and other medical facilities, we are  enabling our students to travel on their life’s path to high school, post-secondary education, and health-related  careers. Some of our partners include: Urban Advantage, Triad Consulting Strategies, the City Parks Foundation, Weill  Cornell Medical College, Brooklyn College, The Nature Conservancy and the East Kings County Chapter of Delta Sigma  Theta Sorority, Inc. We offer a comprehensive medical science curriculum in grade eight with a focus on disease  pathology. We were awarded a generous allocation of $200,000.00 from Brooklyn Borough President Eric L. Adams  with which we will convert a classroom into a hospital room for the purpose of hands-on, real world medical science  instruction.   The Science and Medicine Middle School has fully integrated the Common Core Learning Standards for English  Language Arts and mathematics into the curricula, resulting in coherent instruction within disciplines and across  grades. Theme-based engagement across grade levels equips students for pursuit of college and career opportunities.  An experiential and inquiry-based approach to learning leads to students investing in lessons carefully planned with  attention to close reading strategies, supporting claims using text-based evidence, and conscientious use of academic  vocabulary in discussions. Purposeful curriculum development decisions result in the integration of coherent  instruction, in-depth explorations in mathematics, medical science and performance-based tasks in all subject areas.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   There are three 12:1:1 special education classes (one per grade level) that receive instruction from six licensed special  education teachers and twelve paraprofessionals. Two school counselors provide individual and group counseling to  approximately fifty students. Our students are visual and auditory learners who struggle with comprehension and  stamina while reading lengthy texts. Our 12:1:1 students also struggle with organizing, displaying and explaining their  rationale in multi-step constructed mathematics problems. Our ENL population struggles with reading lengthy texts  and using academic vocabulary in their written responses. Our gifted students need to improve their organizational  and study skills.      4.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Need: Teachers need continued professional development in addressing students’ behavior in classrooms, hallways,  the cafeteria and outside of the building. Teachers need assistance with developing relationships with students where  students feel comfortable and take action to speak with at least one adult before engaging in undesirable behavior.       Need: Per the 2018 Quality Review, we need a student advisory council (which we will call The Parliament) that  engages with staff in order to contribute to school-based decisions and recommendations for improving day-to-day  student life.      Strength: Our Positive Behavioral Intervention and Support system (C. A. R. E. S. : Cooperation, Accountability,  Respect, Environmental Awareness and Strive for Excellence) has been a remarkable success between 2015 and 2018.  Students earn and spend "scholar dollars" in "The Owl's Nest" store for their outstanding citizenship, compliance with  school rules and respecting others.       Strength: Restorative circles facilitated by Therapeutic Intervention for Crisis in Schools-trained teachers and the  opening of the Peer Mediation Center provides an alternative to suspension for disciplinary infractions.      Strength: Our Monday morning advisory series which is grounded in the Just Say Hi social and emotional learning  framework focuses on anti-bullying, avoiding the pitfalls of peer-pressure, positive self-image, respect for self and  others, friendship, goal-setting, gender identity, inclusion and college and career readiness.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   The principal and assistant principal continuously utilize findings from informal and formal ADVANCE observations in  order to guide the Lead Teachers in their design and facilitation of professional learning sessions.    Since 2015, the implementation of our PBIS system has proven to be significantly successful in motivating students to  modify their relationships towards one another as well as taking ownership of their learning.   The Principal, Assistant Principal and lead teachers facilitate professional learning sessions on Monday and Tuesday  afternoons, stepping aside periodically to allow peer teaching and learning to take place where appropriate.    Informal and formal observation feedback from administrators guides teachers in the development and annotation of  their curriculum maps and lesson plans with particular attention to Danielson Component 3c (Engaging Students in  Learning) and Danielson Component 1e (Designing Coherent Instruction). We have developed a common language  regarding the Danielson Framework for Teaching and Learning. Pre and post observation conferences and  professional learning sessions are results-driven. Administration provides teachers with minute-by-minute low  inference notes of their lessons and actionable next steps for future classroom visits.      Strengths:     Teachers are amenable to feedback by administration and peers and participate in debriefing sessions with a   growth mindset to improve student outcomes.     ADVANCE informal and formal observation feedback is specific and detailed with minute-by-minute low   inference evidence.     Administrators' expectations for effective instructional delivery are clearly defined and outlined.   Needs:      Implementation of a school wide system of referring to anchors and exemplars in order to enhance teacher  practice in Danielson component 3d: using Assessments in Instruction.     Balance the urgency of improving teacher practice per the Danielson Framework with establishing school-  wide operational classroom norms that span across all grades and subjects. For example, all periods will  follow a time-specific format that includes the motivation and mini-lesson (10 minutes), work period (20  minutes) and closing (10 minutes).  Schedule the maximum number of double periods for students so that key instruction concepts are enduring.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          25     Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

Teachers will design scaffolded classroom exams that allow all  students to perform on standards-based assessments with  success. For example, the first five items on classroom exams will  foster a "can-do" approach which will encourage students to put  forth their best efforts in completing assessments with integrity  and perseverance.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. THE SCIENCE AND MEDICINE MIDDLE SCHOOL 366, in compliance with the  Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   THE SCIENCE AND MEDICINE MIDDLE SCHOOL 366 will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The school uses the NYS ELA and Math exam data, the DRP (Degrees of Reading Power) data, the Wilson Screening and the  Fountas and Pinnell running Records Assessement to assess ELL students.          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      Student success/AYP  is evaluated based on a combination of portfolios work (including beginning-year baseline assessement  tasks and pre and post unit assessements) rubric-based/assessed written and project work, report card grades, and the  NYSESLAT scores to document students’ progress in ELA reading, writing, speaking and listening skills.     4.

How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   NOT APPLICABLE.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   In general, across proficiency levels & grades ELL/ENL students were weakest in writing. Listening skills were a bit better.  This  was followed by reading skills.  ELL/ENL students’ speaking skills were at the highest level among ELL/ENL students across  proficiency levels & grades.           7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   ELLS receive ESOL services through a push-in/pull-out format.  Students receive small group instruction.  Groups are  no larger than 8-10 students per class, so as to provide more individualized support to meet their language acquistion  needs.  The ESL/ENL teacher pushes into ELA classes and pulls out groups of students to provide service in accordance  with their levels, generally providing a 50-50 ratio of push in/pull out service.   All ESL/ENL and content area  instruction is aligned with the NYS Common Core Learning Standards and DOE curricula/scope and sequences.  The  goal is to facilitate language development while supporting students so they can master grade-level content  knowledge in ELA, Social Studies, Science & Mathematics while building English language proficiency.  On each grade  ELLs are housed in three classes based on their ELL status and IEP designations and needs.  Thus, ELLs are mixed  heterogeneously with and have ample opportunity to learn from their native English speaking peers and ELLs who  have already attained higher English proficiency levels. This also promotes the building of their social and cultural  competencies.  Some pull out groups bridge two grades.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     NOT APPLICABLE   c.  DL program.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                                 We program the ESL/ENL teacher’s program to ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes  per CR Part 154 are being met.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.                   The ESL/ENL teacher and IEP Liaison provide ongoing training for staff and recommend strategies (including, but not  limited to visuals, web based resources, use of bilingual dictionaries and differentited writing scaffolds) that the content area  teachers can utilize to assist students language and lerning needs.  The school also administers a learning survey to all studetns  early in the year, compliles that data by class, and  disseminates that information to all teachers so that they are better  equipped to target instruction to the primary learning modalities of students.  This aids success in the content areas.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?                   ELLs are not evaluated in their Native Language.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status   All students are immersed in the classrooms with their peers.  a.               SIFE students also participate in small group instruction to work on developing their reading (e.g phonemic  awareness, decoding and word study, and increasing sight word recognition), spelling, expanding their survival vocabulary as  well as academic vocabulary & grammar skills.  b.  Newcomers receive both push in and pull out instruction that will help them to learn basic English.  c.  Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding ELLs receive instruction that will help them increase their reading fluency, academic  vocabulary, comprehension, and oral and written expression.   If issues other than language development present themselves,  the ESL/ENL teacher will recommend the student for testing to determine if special services are needed.  d.  Long-term and Commanding ELLs receive instruction that focuses on their specific  literacy deficiencies, and push them to  become more comfortable with increasing complexity of language.  They are  also supported with organizational, test taking  and study skill strategies and help with refining their oral expressive language skills.  e.  Former ELLs receive support primarily through their content area teachers who collaborate with the ESL/ENL teacher  and  review student work to determine what supports are necessary.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers follow the recommendations for ELL-SWDs as indicated in students’ individual IEPs.  Teachers also receive ongoing  guidance and support from the IEP liaison and ESL/ENL teacher.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Teachers follow the recommendations for ELL-SWDs as indicated in students’ individual IEPs.  The ESL/ENL teacher refers to  the IEPs of ELLSs identified as students with disabilities in order to understand and support their academic learning needs and  goals while simultaneously facilitating their English language proficiency development.  The Chapter 408 verfication systems in  place at the school ensure that the ESL/ENL teacher is aware of all changes to the ELL-SWDs IEPs’ throughout the  year.  Additionally, she attends all IEP meetings for ELL-SWD students and offers recommendations (based on each student’s  individual progress) in collaboration with content area teachers for the new IEPs being developed.  ELL-SWDs have equal  accessto everything their general education peers have access to.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Students receive instruction in both ELA & Math that exceeds the NYS Education Department’s required minimum number of  hours of instruction per week.  Teachers modify instruction to ensure that students receive targeted instruction catered to suit  their individual strengths & weaknesses.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      No new programs are being considered at this time.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No programs for ELLS are being discontinued at this time.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are able to participate in all extra curricular activities that their native speaking peers participate in.          12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  ELLs receive instructional support through smart boards, lap tops to access web based resources, bilingual dictionaries, leveled  texts, visual aids, and writing scaffolds.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   The home languages of our ELLs are  Hatian Creole, Arabic and French.  Our staff members who speak these languages provide  additional support to the ELLs.  We also make use of bilingual dictionaries to bridge language gaps.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All instruction, instructional texts and web based resources are provided at age and grade appropriate levels.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    ELLs receive instructional support through smart boards, lap tops to access web based resources, bilingual dictionaries, leveled  texts, visual aids, and writing scaffolds.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year.

What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ESL/ENL teacher will engage in ongoing professional development opportunities provided by the NYC Department of  Education throughout the school year.  She is also a member of TESOL & uses the organization as a professional reference.   The ESL/ENL teacher and IEP Liaison provide ongoing in-school training for teachers of ELLs.  Additionally, staff will benefit  from professional development opportunities provided by our BFSC ELL/ENL specialist.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our ELLs  have access to and are provided with counseling that allows them to express their social and emotional difficulties  and needs due to the scool transitions and those that might arise within their peer groups.  Our two school counselors speak  Hatian Creole and thus, can speak to the majority of our ELLs in their home languge.  As ELLs prepare to transition to high  school, the 8th grade Guidance Counselor conducts classroom workshops about the application process, the different high  schools and what the various ones have to offer.  When possible, she takes students on trips to tour different high  schools.  The ESL/ENL teacher also discusses with 7th graders the importance of making observable academic gains as this may  impact their high school  enrollment.  The ESL/ENL teacher is sent out of the building for all mandated professional development sessions related to servicing the ELL  students.  Additionally, teachers are regularly sent to professional development sessions in their content areas and they are  provided with dedicated time to turn key the training they receive to other members of their departments.  Electronic and  hard copies of agendas and attendance sheets are maintained for all professional development sessions held witin the  school.  Administration and the payroll secretary also maintain records of which staff members attend external professional  development sessions.  When staff members return from these sessions they are required to submit Professional Learning  Forms that highlight the training received and how they plan to utilize/turn key such training.  They also submit a copy of all  materials received so as to continue building a resource library for all staff.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents are invited to and encouraged to attend the school's Open School Night at the beginning of the school year.  They are  also encouraged to attend parent/teacher conferences throughout the school year.  Additionally, parents are notified about  their child's English language acquisition prgress throughout the year through mid quarter progress reports, end quarter report  card grades and comments, and end quarter SESIS progress reports as required.  The school's parent cordinator, Ms. Ferrari- Easter, is available to support all parents, as well as invite them to all parent activities throughout the school year.              2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  ELL parents are encouraged to participate and be involved in all of the school activities that parents of native English speaking  students are involved in.  Translation services are regularly provided by staff members who speak the native languages of the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         parents to inform them of all opportunities for participation and to facilitate their full participation at meetings scheduled for  their individual children.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dennis Herring Jr, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   SCIENCE AND MEDICINE MS 366                                                                              School DBN: 18K366  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      To assess the language preferences of the ELL parent community for both written and oral communication, our  school staff does the following:   1. The LAP team reviews the ATS LIST Notice in June to initially identify incoming ELL students. The ELLs student  list is updated throughout July - August and in September, as new registrants come in.    2. The CUM records are reviewed by office staff as they come in and checked to make sure that all pertinent ELL  documents, including the HLIS are included. The parent language preferences indicated therein are noted.   3. Blue Emergency Cards are also reviewed for language preferences.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      4. The pupil accounting secretary also speaks with parents directly, as well as checks ATS screens, including the  RLER (NYSESLAT Eligibility Roster), the RNMR (NYSESLAT Combined Modality Report) and PARU (Preferred  Language Reading) to determine and update home language preferences of parents.    5. Additionally, the parent coordinator and ENL teacher reach out to families directly and employ various staff  members (who speak Amoy, Arabic, Bengali, French, Fulani, Hatian Creole, Hebrew, Mandarin, Russian and  Spanish, to provide interpretation services if necessary, to ensure that all data is obtained and verified.   3.39% of our population is ELLs. The home language of 76% of these is Hatian Creole and 17.6% Arabic. Four of  our staff members, including one guidance counselor, speak and provide interpretation and translation services to  parents in Hatian Creole. One staff member provides the services in Arabic.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.               Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      Document Name    Month/Frequency   How do you   Distributed to   plan to   Families    translate?   Include   procedures  to ensure   timely   provision of  translated  documents  to parents.

This  document also includes essential email and phone contact numbers  for administration, deans, guidance counselors and the parent  coordinator.            2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as   parent-teacher   conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.        Meeting Name    Month/Frequency   of Meetings    How does  your school   plan to  provide   interpretation   service(s)?       Our formal face-to-face meetings with parents will occur as follows:      Wednesday, September 16, 2015 (4:30 PM-7:30 PM) - Parent Teacher  Conference #1   Wednesday, September 30, 2015 (6:00 PM) - High School Application  Process: Grade 8   Thurdsay, October 1, 2015 (6:00 PM) - High School Process  Information Night: Grade 7   Tuesday, November 17, 2015 (1:00 - 3:00PM & 4:30 - 7:30 PM) -  Parent Teacher Conference #2 (11:20AM dismissal)   Thursday, March 17, 2016 (1:00 - 3:00PM & 4:30 - 7:30 PM) - Parent  Teacher Conference #3 (11:20AM dismissal)           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58     3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.                  Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.                   Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      We will fulfill parental notification requirements for translation and interpretation services, as per Section VII of  Chancellor's Regulations A-663 by doing the following:   1. Providing each parent whose primary language is a covered language and who require assistance services with a  copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities, which includes their rights regarding translation and  interpretation services. This will be provided in the parents' home/preferred language.   2. Posting at or near the primary entrance of the school, a sign in each of the covered languages, indicating the  availability of interpretation services.    3. Ensuring that the school's safety plan contains procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language access  services are not prevented from reaching the school's administrative offices solely due to language barriers.           Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       The school currently uses informal feedback provided chiefly through one-to-one conversations with ELL parents to  gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services. We have considered developing and using a  survey, which we will make available in the parents home/preferred languages identified above, to gather tht  feedback, but we have not yet done so.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59
