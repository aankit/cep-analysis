This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of PS 96Q elementary school is to educate the whole child and prepare all students with readiness skills  essential for the future. We believe that the school community shares the responsibility for the success of all  students. Our goal is to create a shared path of community learners where students, staff and parents work  collaboratively to support each other academically, socially and ethnically, in a nurturing and safe environment of  academic excellence. It is the belief of the PS 96Q community that students learn best when they are actively engaged  and challenged.

This data showed a 9.1% increase in students achievement levels over the 2016-2017 school year.   Further analysis revealed 67.9% of students in fourth grade, 60.0% of students in third grade, and 41.0% of students in  fifth grade achieved levels 3 and 4. This data indicates a 9.1%, 2.1% and 11.7% growth in the percentage of students  meeting proficency levels in grades 3, 4 and 5 respectvely.    Analysis of the 2017-18 ReadyGen assessment for all students grades in grades 1 and 2 revealed students  demonstrated growth. Data indicated:    *36.8% of students in grade 1 were proficient in the Beginning of Year Assessment. The End-of-Year data reflected  student progress with 60.5% of the students meeting proficiency levels and 15.8% approaching grade level standards.    *In second grade, similar trends were noted. 12.5% of students in grade 2 were proficient at the Beginning of the Year  assessment. End-of-Year data indicated 47.9% of students meeting proficiency levels and 15.0% approaching grade  level standards. As revealed by the data, it is crucial to continue to strengthen our students' literacy development  with a focus on reducing the number of students on performance levels 2 and a need for an increased number of  students attaining proficiency levels 3 and 4.   School's Quality Review report noted that PS 96Q effectively use various formative assessments to assess students’  progress and demonstrates a reflective approach to instructions. Students engagement in peer and self-assessments  were evident.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   In the 2017-18 school year, PS 96Q focused extensively on engaging parents and families in building Strong Family- Community Ties in alignment with the Framework for Great Schools. Our goal was to increase our family partnerships  and collaboration as we prepare all students with college and career readiness skills. The 2016-17 School Quality  Guide indicated School Outreach to parents at 93.0% and a score of 3.20 points in Strong Family-Community Ties.  Further analysis of the 2016-17 School Environmental Survey revealed the following:   ● 96% of parents/guardians agreed or strongly agreed that their child's school communicates with them in a language  and in a way that they can understand.    ● 97% of parents and guardians strongly agreed that teachers and parents/guardians think of each other as partners  in educating children.   ● 97% of parents indicated that the school partner with families to support success.    ● 82% of parents/guardians agreed or strongly agreed that they are invited to visit classrooms to observe instruction.   Although our average parent attendance in school events increased by more than 50%, there is a need to continue to  reach out to our parents and families. In the 2017-18 school year, to achieve our goal of more parental attendance in  school events, we will conduct a survey of parents to get their feedback and ideas on how we can effectively support  and partner with them. To further increase parental involvement and enhance students success in school, we will  continue to provide parents/guardians the opportunity to volunteer time and support the PS 96Q school community.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties.

Progress based on the Common Core  Learning Standards that offer a clear portrait of student mastery of key concepts in Math and ELA will be determine  and analyzed. Grade level teams will use an analysis of common assessments (revised assessments, ReadyGen bench  mark assessments, math unit assessments, grade level constructed performance check lists, MOSL baseline  assessments, and teacher designed assessments) to create a clear representation of student progress towards goals  across subject areas. Grade level teams will adjust curricular and instructional decisions so that all students  demonstrate increased mastery.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42   Column B   Section Reference(s)  Section 5A, 5B,     Section 5A, 5C     Section 5A, 5C, 5E         Section 5A, 5B,5C,  5E        may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43            IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS96Q in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       PS96Q will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home- school, partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about PS96Q and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      ● providing professional development opportunities for PS96Q staff to improve outreach, communication skills and  cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other members of PS96Q community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   PS96Q’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. PS96Q  community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement policy with  Title I parents to improve the academic quality of PS96Q. The findings of the evaluation through PS96Q surveys and  feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and enhance PS96Q ’s  Title I program. This information will be maintained by PS96Q .          In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members  of the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School  Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their  members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school  will:  actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     Title I Priority and Focus Schools and the parents of students served in the Title I program must jointly agree  upon the use of these additional funds to support increased parent engagement/education to enable parents  to effectively support their child’s learning.     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Although these students are mainly at the Expanding or Commanding level  on the NYSESLAT, they were chosen so that we can continue to help them meet the rigorous  demands of the Common Core curriculum. The direct instruction component of the program will  consist of a before and after school program that will be used to develop language proficiency  and improve our student's academic achievement in Math and ELA.      The objective of the program is to help our students become proficient in  English  and also to  improve their reading and math skills. The students will be provided with instruction in listening,  speaking, reading and writing. This will take into account their learning styles and identified  intelligences. Instruction will be differentiated to suit their needs based on ongoing formative  assessments. They will be exposed to scaffolding strategies that will enhance acquisition of  language and mastery in math. Content will be comprehensible in order to improve students  academic language development. Students will use a variety of graphic organizers to help them  process and evaluate information and develop better writing skills so they can meet the  higher  academic standards and work towards proficiency on the NYSESLAT as well as the state exams  in Math and ELA.       The program will meet twice a week before school for grades 3-5 and after school for grades K- 2. The hours will be from 7:30am-8:15am for 3-5 and 2:45pm-4:15pm for K-2 on Wednesdays  and Thursdays. Attendance will be taken for each session and records will be kept by the ENL  teacher in the Title III binder. The after school program will begin in November and end in May  for about 40 sessions. Notifications for program eligibility will be sent home in English and the  parent's preferred language when necessary. We will utilize the services of the Translation and  Interpretation Unit to translate these letters and copies of all notices sent home will be  maintained by the ENL teacher.      The language of instruction will be English, however the students native language will be used in  order to promote and encourage comprehension when necessary. Students will have access to  bilingual glossaries, dictionaries and books, as well as I-pads in order to translate or look up  words. Groups will be formed based on grade and proficiency level, but they will be flexible  according to individual needs and based on ongoing assessments. This program will assist and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   support our ELLs to enhance their ability to meet the performance standards in the content areas  and become college and career ready.     The instruction for this program will be provided by a certified ENL teacher.  It will focus on  developing social and academic language skills in the areas of speaking, listening, reading and  writing. Math instruction will focus on moving from the concrete to the abstract and solving  word problems. All instructions will be in alignment with the Common Core curriculum.  Students will use manipulatives and technological tools while engaging in problem solving  activities. The teacher will scaffold and differentiate instructions to meet the needs of the  students. Data analysis from NYSESLAT, NYS ELA and Math, BOY assessments, running  records, end of unit assessments, observations and teacher generated assessments will be used to  identify strengths and weaknesses and drive instruction.      Materials to be used will include test preparation books in  reading, writing and math and the  Read 180 program. Read 180 is designed to differentiate instruction and meet students at their  own level. It emphasizes developing academic language and vocabulary.  Students will also read  leveled fiction and non-fiction books and use computers and I-pads to augment the program. The  teacher will focus on developing students academic language in order for them to communicate  effectively in English and be prepared to take the state exams. The teacher will demonstrate,  model, use graphic organizers, simplify and paraphrase instructional language and focus on  explicit teaching of key vocabulary. All instruction will be differentiated to meet the diverse  needs of the students. Developmentally appropriate strategies and hands-on activities will be  used.

Since our ENL population continues to change, our classroom  teachers need professional development that will enhance their pedagogy and enable them to  teach our ELL  students more effectively.      Our ENL teacher attends professional development sessions that are held by our network ELL  supervisor. These meetings are usually one per month and they are facilitated by the ELL South  Team. These workshops focus on instruction that supports academic rigor and high expectations  for ELLs. The ENL teacher will then turnkey new information to the staff during faculty  conferences and common prep times. Classroom teachers  also link with the ENL teacher during  Circular 6, to discuss individual student needs and concerns. These meetings will occur every  week during the Circle 6 time for each grade band. For example, K-2 teachers will meet with the  ENL teacher on Tuesdays, period 7, every week.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         Part C: Professional Development   All classroom teachers receive professional development on a regular basis during our after  school meetings. Topics include Vocabulary Instruction, Analyzing student work, Questioning  Techniques, Differentiated Instruction, Curriculum Mapping, Assessment, etc.      The ENL teacher will provide workshops as needed for classroom teachers in order to share  methodologies and best practices that will reinforce the program in the classroom. Skills and  strategies for teaching ELLs will be shared so that the teachers can best meet the needs of the  students.      In order to support our Title III program, the ENL teacher in the building will conduct several  PD sessions for the staff assigned to the program. These sessions will take place after school for  one hour and Title III funds will be used to pay teachers the per session rate. Attendance records  and the agenda for each professional development session will be kept in the Title III binder.The  professional development will begin in December and continue once a month for the duration of  the program for a total of 5 sessions.

This program will meet twice a week for an hour and a half each day  from 5:00pm - 6:30pm. It will begin on January 9, 2019 and meet for approximately 15 sessions.  This program will support and facilitate the language acquisition skills of our parents.      Many of our parents have limited English skills and would benefit from classes that will teach  them life skills, literacy and math.  This will allow them to be able to help their children with  their schoolwork, improve their communication skills and help them improve the achievement of  our English Language Learners. Instruction will be provided by a certified ENL teacher who will  use ENL methodologies and strategies to improve the social and academic language of the  parents. This will empower them to function in our competitive society. Classes will focus on  math, literacy and life skills. They will also learn math and literacy test tips, information about  the NYSESLAT, promotional criteria and testing accommodations.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  In order to guide instructional planning for our English Language Learners (ELLs), we are currently using Fountas and Pinnell  along with teacher created assessments. As a student reads from a benchmark book, the teacher is able to make notations on  fluency,  self-correction, meaning and structure. This information allows teachers to place students at their developmentally  appropriate instructional level and identify the student’s independent reading level. The data from the running records shows  that many of our ELLs are reading below grade level, especially our students in grades K and 1. This means that the English as a  New Language (ENL) teacher will be working closely with the classroom teacher to address the deficiencies in reading  skills.Teacher created assessments are also used to assess mastery of math and writing skills and the information gathered is  used to provide additional assistance and inform instruction in these areas.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      Based on the information gathered from both the Fountas and Pinnell assessments and teacher created assessments, the ENL  teacher and the classroom teacher gather information about each student's strengths and weaknesses. The ENL teacher and  each classroom teacher work together to plan for effective instruction using   push-in and pull-out instructional models. The  classroom teacher and the ENL teacher communicate each week in order to plan lessons that target specific skills based on  formative assessments. Guided reading and shared reading are used in the ENL class in order to build vocabulary and increase  comprehension. During push-in instruction, the ENL teacher works with students in their classrooms to provide targeted  instruction based on identified areas of need.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  P.S. 96Q uses the ELL Periodic Assessments, NYSESLAT, NYSITELL and the NYC Performance Tasks to identify baselines,  progress and areas of need. For newly admitted students, the NYSITELL is used as a baseline to determine each child's level  of  English language proficiency. The NYC Math Performance Tasks and the NYC Writing Prompt are also used to measure  progress and areas of need. Teachers use the data to assess each child's individual growth as well as any areas of  weakness.  Results from the Periodic Assessments, Fountas and Pinnell and NYSESLAT, are further used to determine if our  students are meeting AYP for ELL's. This feedback helps to guide the instruction of the ENL program and assess the needs of  students in the four modalities. Based on our evaluation, different teaching methodologies are used to create effective  teaching practices and learning.  Evaluation is on-going process and helps to determine students progress and the  effectiveness of the programs.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered, the information is shared with both the ENL teacher and classroom teacher so  that students progress and identified areas of need can be addressed. Our teachers work collaboratively  together to  plan instruction that is effective and meets the individual needs  of each child. All interventions are dependent on identified  student need and  may include targeted instruction on a specific skill, participation in AIS services or inclusion in our after  school or Saturday academy. Data will be analyzed throughout the year to ensure that all instructional decisions are rigorous  and impactful in order to meet students' specific needs.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   P.S.96Q gathers data from multiple sources throughout the school year.  Data including, formative and summative  assessments data are analyzed and used to drive instruction. During our Circular 6 meetings, grade specific teachers and the  ENL teacher meet on a weekly basis in Inquiry Team to assess students academic progress and plan standard based instruction.  Students who are identified as being in Tier 1 are exposed to a rigorous, creative curriculum which includes language  development for ELLs. Those students who are identified as Tier 2,  participate in Academic Intervention groups where  instruction and assessments are differentiated to meet their needs, in addition to teaching the core instruction. Intensive and  individualized instruction that focuses on a small, targeted set of skills is given to those students identified as Tier 3 in a small  group setting or one-to- one instruction for students who participate in the SETTS program. Data from periodic assessments  and on-going formal and informal assessments will be analyzed throughout the year so that all instructional decisions are  made using the most current data .       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   P.S. 96Q uses a combination of data sources; NYSESLAT and the New York State ELA and Math exams to evaluate and inform  our ELL program. Overall, our ELL's performed very well on the NYSESLAT. Eight students who were at the Advanced level last  year tested at the Commanding level on the 2017 exam. Eighteen students scored at the Expanding level, six students scored  at the Transitional level, four scored at the Emerging level and only 3 students were at the Entering level. The students who  scored at the Entering level were all new admits to our school last year and were only here for part of the year. Our NYSITELL  results from Fall 2017 were as follows; five Entering, one Transitioning, three Expanding and three Commanding. Data from   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         the NYSESLAT reveals that our students need to work on their reading and writing skills and that several of our students still  need to refine their listening skills. The ESL teacher will focus on these areas during both pull-out and push-in instruction.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Once the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL scores are uploaded in ATS, the information is shared with the ENL and classroom teacher,  so that students can be properly grouped for instruction and we can provide targeted instruction in speaking, reading, writing  and/or listening if needed. Classroom teachers are given a list of ELLs in their classroom along with their level of proficiency  and areas of need based on the exam results. Results from the Math and ELA assessments are also shared with all teachers so  that everyone is aware of each students progress in these areas. Students can then receive extra assistance in any identified  areas of need.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.    Our ELL students are grouped heterogeneously by grade level for their standalone ENL instruction, with no more than  two grades together. Instruction during this time is focused on developing language skills so that students can be  successful in the core content areas The  ENL teacher will work with a small group of students in the ENL classroom in  order to focus on the language needs of each child. Integrated instruction is done on each grade level. During this  time, the ENL teacher will work alongside the classroom teacher to build English language skills through content area  instruction in ELA or Math. The ENL teacher and the classroom teacher will co-plan in order to teach  both the  language and content standards.   Students at the Entering and Emerging levels will receive 180 minutes of standalone  ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL. Students who are at the Transitioning level will receive 90 minutes of  integrated ENL and 90 minutes of either standalone ENL or more integrated ENL. Students at the Expanding level will  receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL and students who are commanding will receive 90 minutes of integrated  ENL.       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A:         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   All students receive their mandated instructional time each week from the ENL teacher. Our Entering and Emerging level  students receive 360 total minutes of ENL instruction which includes 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of  integrated ENL/ELA, our Transitioning and Expanding students receive 180 total minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction and  our Commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL instruction. All instruction is in compliance with the CR Part  154 requirements for English as a New Language. Students will receive the required minutes of both standalone ENL and  integrated ENL based on their proficiency level. The proficiency level of each ELL is communicated with the classroom teacher  so that differentiated instruction can be provided based on individual needs. We do not offer a separate Home Language Arts  program, but home language support is provided through the use of bilingual glossaries and dictionaries, bilingual flashcards,  trade books in the native language, peer tutoring and placement in a class with a teacher or student who speaks the child's   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      native language(if possible). Several of our bilingual staff members provide additional support and individual assistance to  students who are newcomers.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Our ENL program provides both literacy and content area instruction. Data from interim assessments, running records,  performance tasks, baseline assessments, individual students conferences and monthly assessments in math and ELA are used  to drive instruction. Literacy instruction is provided each day through the use of read-alouds, shared reading, guided reading,  shared writing and individual writing. Grade level content instruction in social studies, science and math is also provided during  integrated ENL instruction. The ENL teacher uses math manipulatives, posters, maps, pictures, graphic organizers, trade books,  big books, realia, picture dictionaries and multi-media support in order to make the content more comprehensible.  Academic rigor and consistency are the keys to our student's success. The ENL teacher works closely with the classroom  teachers in order to align the ENL instruction with content area instruction in each grade. Scaffolding strategies such as pre- teaching vocabulary, using prior knowledge, modeling, and contextualization are woven throughout each lesson. Instruction is  designed to address the needs of learners at each proficiency level so that language and cognitive skills are developed through  content topics and themes. All content area instruction is aligned with the Common Core Standards in ELA and Math and the  New York State Standards in Science and Social Studies. The ENL teacher and content area teachers use formal and informal  assessments to determine movement toward content standards.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   P.S. 96Q ensures that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language by providing translated versions of  standardized tests in both math and science where applicable. When these tests are not available in the students home  language, a translator is used so that students can be assessed along with their peers. Students also have access to glossaries  in their first language and bilingual dictionaries and multi- cultural books to enhance their language acquisition.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    6a. Currently there are no SIFE students at P.S. 96Q. However, if such students are registered their needs will be addressed by  using differentiated instruction and ensuring that they are given their mandated hours of instruction based on their proficiency  levels. Teaching skills and strategies will be modified to accommodate their academic profiles and learning styles.  6b. Students who have been in school for less than three years are given intensive instruction in phonics and phonemic  awareness . P.S. 96Q uses Ready Gen for literacy in grades K- 5 and our ELLs participate in that rigorous program. They are also  given many opportunities to develop their listening and speaking skills. They are exposed to guided reading and writing lessons  and participate in all class and school wide activities. They are immersed in reading, and teachers also adhere to academic  rigor in all areas. Therefore, students are exposed to explicit content area instruction that develops their academic language.  Instruction will be differentiated to meet the needs of students. English Language Learners will receive instruction as  mandated by CR Part 154. In addition, students will participate in academic intervention services (AIS), SETTS and after school  programs where deemed necessary. Students reaching proficiency on the NYSESLAT will continue to be given testing  accommodations for two consecutive years and will continue to receive 90 minutes a week of integrated ENL instruction.  Students at the beginning of proficiency level will participate in a computer based program, Imagine Learning, for at least 25  minutes every day.  6c. Students who are in the program for four to six years will be identified based on the RLER. These students are referred to  the Pupil Personnel Team (PPT). Students are then tested should the need arise and placed in SETTS classes and/or given  additional academic intervention services (AIS). Title III funds will be used to form after school classes in which these students  will participate focusing on identified educational deficiencies in Literacy and math. All service providers are qualified in their   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      subject areas. The ESL teacher collaborates with classroom teachers and related service providers in order to plan instruction  to meet the academic needs of students. The mode of delivery of service will be either push - in or pull -out model.  6d. There are no long term English Language Learners at P.S. 96Q. However, should the need arise, those students will  continue to be exposed to rigorous instruction using ESL methodologies that would promote their language acquisition and  improve their academic language. They will have access to computers, technology and varied materials that would foster  literacy development using their background knowledge in prior experiences.  6e. Former ELLs will continue to receive testing accommodations for up to two years after becoming proficient on the  NYSESLAT. They will also now receive 90 minutes per week of ENL instruction in the content area. They will also participate in  all After - School, Early Bird, Saturday programs and Extended Day classes when made available.            6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   English learners who have been identified as having special needs will receive instruction based on their IEPs. They will also  receive push in/pull out services by the SETTS teacher and/or speech and language services where identified.  IEP's will be  reviewed and based on the findings, scaffolded instruction will be provided through the use of varied graphic organizers,  differentiated instruction, and visuals, taking into account the students learning styles. During ELA instruction the ENL and  classroom teacher will modify the Ready Gen curriculum as needed in order to make it accessible for our students. This may  include the use of visuals, pre-teaching vocabulary, using personal word walls, and chunking the text. Students will have access  to word walls, picture dictionaries, flash cards, a photo library, the internet, and other tools that are available to provide extra  support when needed. Students will also participate in the Imagine Learning computer-based program which is individualized  to suit students' academic needs and would accelerate their English Language development           7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school provides every opportunity to enable our ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency within  the least restrictive environment. 2 of our ELL-SWD's are in an ICT class and four are currently in a self-contained class.  These students  are integrated with other English language learners during the ENL period. They interact with the general  education population at lunch, during assembly programs and in school -wide activities. In addition they participate in the  health and physical education classes with the rest of the school's population. Students are given differentiated instruction  that will meet their needs and help them achieve their IEP goals.             8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  English learners participate fully in all intervention programs. They receive the required hours of instruction based on their  proficiency level as per CR Part 154. In addition, students with IEPs receive instruction from the SETTS teacher and other  students receive instruction in Math and ELA from the AIS teachers. They also participate in After- School programs. Using the  assessments available, the teacher focuses on the students' academic deficiencies and plans lessons to improve those areas.  All instruction is given in English, but teachers take into account the students' first languages and utilize them where necessary.  Some English Language Learners receive speech and language services  in a small group setting. Our lowest performing first  graders will participate in the Reading Rescue program which is a short term intervention for students having extreme  difficulty with early reading and writing. Our Reading Rescue teacher works with selected students in daily 30 minute lessons  lasting 12-20 weeks. After a full series of lessons, 75% of these students will reach grade level. Students who score at the  Commanding level on the NYSESLAT, continue to receive testing accommodations for two years and will also receive 90  minutes a week of integrated ENL instruction. Our current and former ELLs are also invited to take part in our Saturday  Academy for grades 2-5. This program focuses on helping students achieve proficiency in english and also improve their math  skills. They will be provided with instruction in listening, speaking, reading and writing and will be exposed to scaffolding   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      strategies that will enhance acquisition of language and mastery of math. Our K -2 students are invited to join our after school  science club for ELLs that provides hands on experience in science while building language skills. An after school science  program for students in grade 4 is conducted from January through May in order to prepare our students for the NY State  Science exam. All ELLs are included in this program that is held for two days per week. Students are placed in small groups or  flexible cooperative learning groups as the need arises. Instruction is differentiated using scaffolding strategies.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Data from the 2017 NYSESLAT exam shows that our students are making steady progress towards proficiency with 51% of our  students scoring at the Expanding level. For the upcoming  school year we will continue to use the I-Ready website school- wide. I-Ready provides data-driven insight that will allow teachers to determine how to focus their instructional time to ensure  that students are on track to meet the rigorous expectations of the Common Core. Students take diagnostic exams online in  both math and reading that generate reports that help teachers understand what each student can do and next steps to  inform instruction. The program provides on-line lessons that are differentiated according to each child's needs and provides  on going assessment and feedback to the teacher.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  English Language Learners are afforded equal access to all school programs. They are invited to participate in our Sports and  Art After School program and attend all trips, school-wide assemblies and special events. Students are also offered the  opportunity to participate in  our after school ESL program  for grades k-5 and any other after school programs that might be  available.  The objective of the after school program is to help our students become proficient in English  while improving their  reading and math skills. The focus will be on developing social and academic language skills in the areas of speaking, listening,  reading and writing. Math instruction will vous on moving from the concrete to the abstract and solving word problems.  Students will use manipulatives, tools and technology and the teacher will scaffold and differentiate instruction to meet their  needs. All notices for programs are sent home in the student’s native language and in English.  Our goal is to improve the  language acquisition skills and the academic language of our ELLs.         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  P.S.96 uses a variety of instructional materials to enhance students’ academic language development and acquisition:  •Raz-Kids is an online guided reading program with interactive e-books, down loadable books and reading quizzes. It provides  online running records that let teachers digitally assess each student. Students can listen to books for modeled  fluency, read  books on their own and even record themselves reading to practice fluency. This program can be used at school and at home.   •Treasure Chest – Macmillian/ McGraw Hill. Kindergarten and grades 1 and 2, use this research-based Reading/ Language Arts  program. It uses effective phonemic awareness instruction and extends their understanding of narrative and informational  text. •Handprints – An Early Reading Program which focuses on phonics and phonemic awareness. Phonics and Phonemic  Awareness – by McGraw Hill. Month by Month Phonics is also used to supplement other phonics programs when necessary.  •Leveled books on tapes – New Heights – Building Fluency and Comprehension audio books. This fosters reading fluency,  comprehension and vocabulary development. Students read independently using books matched to their instructional level.  •Lending Libraries – students read fiction and non-fiction books which are leveled and grade appropriate (Fountas and Pinnell)  •Content area books – P.S. 96Q uses the Core Knowledge Curriculum which facilitates differentiated instruction and small  group instruction. It exposes ELLs to a wide range of visual and text features that support their acquisition of language and is  knowledge based. Students read books on tape matched to their instructional levels using headphones. Students confer with  teachers before and after readings.  •Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT and Beyond – Attanansio & Associates. This book prepares students for the NYSESLAT  focusing on the four modalities of listening, speaking, reading and writing. Empire State NYSESLAT - Continental Press -  Preparation for NYSESLAT also focuses on test preparation. • A variety of test preparation books are used to prepare students  for ELA and Math State tests.  • Audio books – Leap Pad Library – Leap Frog School House help students develop their listening and speaking skills. • Picture   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         dictionaries in Spanish and Math and Science glossaries are available for student use.  Bilingual dictionaries in Arabic, Punjabi,  Haitian Creole and Spanish are available. • Books and CD Sets , games and puzzles are used to encompass different learning  styles and multiple intelligences.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   ENL students have the opportunity to use bilingual glossaries and dictionaries where appropriate during instruction. They are  also entitled to use bilingual glossaries and translated text in Math and Science during state exams. Students are encouraged  to use supplemental materials beneficial to them especially if they demonstrate mastery in their first language. Students can  also borrow books in their native language where available. Bilingual dictionaries have been purchased in Spanish, Arabic,  Punjabi and Haitian Creole and are available to students.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All required services support our ELLs based on age, grade and proficiency level. Students are grouped together to best meet  their needs and differentiation is used so that each child can achieve the state designated level of English proficiency for their  grade. Grade level resources in math and ELA are used and scaffolded for deeper understanding. Manipulatives, visuals and  graphic organizers are also used for support. All resources are carefully chosen based on the needs of each individual, taking  into account their age and grade level.  Leveled libraries are utilized, and audio books are used related to grade and proficiency levels. Bilingual glossaries, dictionaries  and bilingual books are available to students.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newcomers are identified by the ENL teacher and then tested and placed using the NYSITELL within ten days of registration.  They are identified as being at the Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding or Commanding level. Students are placed in  general education classes but get the ENL instruction they need as per CR Part 154 requirements using a push-in or pull-out  model. Currently,  P.S. 96Q does not provide services or activities to assist newly enrolled English Language Learners before the  beginning of the school year. When students enroll throughout the year they are placed in a class with a student who speaks  their language, when possible. They are also paired with a buddy in the classroom to help them adjust to the routines and  procedures. Our bilingual staff members and guidance counselor are also used as a resource for these students, if needed.          17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    P.S. 96Q does not offer any language electives. All instruction is given in English.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our ENL teacher attends the ELL Instructional Leadership Institute, which is presented by the Queens South Field Support  Center.The ELL Instructional Leadership Institute's primary focus is to build school capacity around best practices for language  instruction by ensuring that all leaders have a shared understanding of best practices for English language learners.  This year-long institute is designed to support Elementary and K-8 Assistant Principals and ENL coordinators in advancing a  comprehensive ELL program that aligns both compliance and instruction. Topics presented will focus on building a robust  instructional core through the lens of facilitative leadership.  Professional development focuses on the preparation of lesson plans that support academic rigor and high expectations for  ELL students. ENL teachers and teachers of English Language learners have been trained to use Smart Board technology and  the internet to enhance instruction and expose students to 21  st   Century learning. Teachers also have common planning  periods (Circular 6) where they collaborate and discuss teachers’ and students’ needs. They identify areas to be addressed and  refocused so that instruction to ELLs is enhanced and appropriate interventions implemented. Teachers are exposed to regular  professional development on a weekly basis by school administration which enables them to acquire additional expertise so  that they can implement instruction that would enhance learning to the ELLs in their classes. The ENL teacher turnkeys new  information to the rest of the staff. One on one conferences are conducted with the secretary to apprise her of the current  mandates and requirements for students and parents of English Language Learners. Para professionals, special education  teachers, guidance counselor, parent coordinator and the assistant principal participate in our faculty conferences when  professional development is conducted. The psychologist works at P.S.96 one day a week and the speech therapists,  occupational therapist and physical therapist work two days a week. If present, they also participate in our professional  development activities. During Circular 6 sessions and preparation periods, ELL workshops are also conducted. Professional  Development workshops are planned for the entire school year by Administration. During this time teachers collaborate in  teams based on grades/subject area and discuss varied topics inclusive of:  a. MOSL  b. Data Analysis using student work c. Questioning Techniques - Danielson d. Differentiated Instruction for ELLs  e.  Manipulatives in Math  Some other topics that are important for ELLs and SWD's include: a. Activating Prior Knowledge b. Developing Academic  Vocabulary c. Comprehension Monitoring d. Scaffolding Techniques e. Generating Questions (DOK)  Social Studies and Science instruction is incorporated into our balanced literacy framework with a focus on developing  academic language and comprehension monitoring. The ReadyGen reading program is used in grades K-5 and many of the  reading passages are based on social studies and science topics (non-fiction).  Math topics include:  a.- Curriculum mapping - unit planning  b.- Examination of math online programs  c.- differentiation in  math for ELL's  d.- Performance based assessments  e. - Alignment of mathematical practices to standards.  The ENL teacher attends all professional development at the school level every Monday and Tuesday afternoon, as well as,  full  day staff development as scheduled and also the district-wide meetings for all teachers of ELLS. During these meetings issues  related to supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards are addressed and  teachers collaborate  and share successful strategies for providing ways to help our students meet the standards. The ENL teacher will also attend  city wide staff development sessions that pertain to ELL issues.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Professional Development is scheduled by the administration for the entire school year. A portion of all the professional  development includes ELL training for staff in using ESL methodologies and strategies to use with English Language Learners. A  minimum of 15% of the required professional development hours for all teachers will be dedicated to language acquisition,  including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELL's. For the  ENL teacher, a minimum of 50% of PD will be dedicated to those topics . During Circular 6 (45 minutes) which is held once per  week, teachers are also exposed to ESL methodologies to be used with the English Language Learners in their classrooms.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         Teachers will document their time as they use a Sign-In sheet which would determine the number of minutes  and the topics  covered. These sign in sheets would be kept by Administration as evidence of  participation. Some of the topics for ESL  professional development include   1. Successful Strategies for English Language Learners a. Using the Workshop Model  b. Scaffolding Instruction  c. Questioning  techniques for English Language Learners d. Developing Academic Language Vocabulary  2. Differentiated Instruction  a. Introduction to DIfferentiation,  b. Assessment,  c. Strategies/Materials/Activities  3. Stages of Second Language Development 4. Using Technology with English Language Learners        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In addition to the mandated parent orientation meeting and scheduled parent -teacher conferences, parents will be invited to  attend an individual meeting once a year to discuss goals of the program, progress in language acquisition, assessment results  and the students individual language development needs in the content area. A letter will be sent home to the parent of each  ELL asking that they make an appointment to meet with the teacher at a convenient time so that each child's needs can be  addressed. Letters will be sent home in both English and the native language when necessary and phone calls will be made to  those parents who do not respond. We will use on-staff translation whenever possible and will utilize the services of the  Translation and Interpretation Unit by phone if needed.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Parents at P.S. 96Q are involved in many school activities. They assist at morning line up, taking students to classes when they  are late and collecting attendance scan sheets. In addition, they assist teachers in all grades, organizing folders, leveling books  and other classroom activities. These parents have had training with Learning Leaders. All activities include parents of ELLs. The  Parent Association coordinates taking of school pictures, other fund raising activities and plan future events with the parent  coordinator. Five parents are members of the school leadership team. Parents participate in monthly workshops that focus on  different topics that are relevant to their needs. Our ELL parents also attend an after school program designed to help them  learn English. This program provides instruction in literacy, math and life skills that will allow them to improve their  communication skills and help their children with their schoolwork.              Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Vivian Eweka, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN: 27Q96  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      In order to assess the language preferences for both written and oral communication of our parents we examined  Part III of our Home Language Identification Surveys, reviewed our emergency cards and surveyed our teachers.  We also spoke with several parents, our Parent Coordinator and our bilingual staff members in order to  determine the types of services necessary so that all of our parents can receive information in a language they  understand. Finally, we ran the RAPL report in to confirm our findings. While most of our parents speak English,  we do have a few parents who requested information from the school in Spanish, Punjabi, Arabic and Urdu. About  5.6% indicated Arabic as their preferred language, 7.6% indicated Spanish and 2.6% indicated Punjabi and 2%  indicated Urdu.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68     2.
