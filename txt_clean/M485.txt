This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission    Section 4: CEP Overview      The Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts (LaGuardia High School) enjoys an  international reputation as the first and foremost high school committed to nurturing students dedicated to the Arts.  LaGuardia High School continues to be the model for schools for the arts throughout the world because the school’s  dual mission provides a uniquely balanced educational experience that includes both a    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      demanding conservatory-style training and a rigorous comprehensive academic program.                2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    History    The “Fame” School    In 1936, New York City Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia founded the High School of Music & Art in order to provide a  facility where the most gifted and talented public school students of New York City could pursue their talents in art or  music, while also completing a full academic program of instruction. In 1948, the School of Performing Arts was  created to provide training in performance skills to students who wished to prepare for professional careers in dance,  music or drama. In 1969, the Board of Education honored Mayor LaGuardia by naming the new building at Lincoln  Center after him and in September 1984, after more than 20 years of waiting, Music & Art and Performing Arts came  together as Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts.    Admission Criteria    Admission to LaGuardia High School is based on a competitive audition and review of a student’s academic record to  ensure success in the school’s demanding studio work and challenging academic program. Successful candidates are  expected to exhibit an intermediate to advanced level of proficiency in their art forms. Students are evaluated based  on preparation for the audition, level of commitment to their art form, technical proficiency, and artistic expression.  Students audition for acceptance in one of the following studios: Dance, Drama, Technical Theatre, Fine Arts,  Instrumental Music, and Vocal Music.    School Overview    LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts (LaGuardia Arts) has one of the most diverse student  populations in New York City. Students travel to LaGuardia from all five boroughs. The demographic breakdown is as  follows: 45% White, 19% Hispanic, 19% Asian, 11% Black, 5% Other. For four consecutive years, LaGuardia Arts was  recognized by the US Department of Education as a “Reward School” celebrating our success in meeting the needs of  all learners and having no gaps in achievement by race or socioeconomic status.   Students are admitted on the basis of potential and achievement, as demonstrated in a demanding and competitive  audition, and a review of their academic records. Currently there are nine specialized high schools in New York City,  and LaGuardia remains the sole specialized school of the arts. It is important to note that LaGuardia was the first  school in the nation to provide a free, publicly funded program for students with unique talents in the arts. This model  has been replicated in most major cities throughout the country.   LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts provides each student with professional preparation in  conservatory arts education and in college preparatory academic education. Each child in the school has a team of  adults who genuinely cares for him/her. Students and families are reflective and articulate the different types of life  experiences LaGuardia has offered. LaGuardia has a strong framework that engenders success in academics and the  arts. All students are matched with consistent high expectations in each classroom for how students learn best and  how their learning time should be spent actively and reflectively each instructional day.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts has 2,796 students. The school operates on a  10-period day (45 minutes each) from 8:00 AM to 4:09 PM. This is one of the longest school days in the city in order to  accomplish the dual mission of Arts and Academics. Lunch occurs Periods 4-8 in two student dining halls. We are a  multi-session school with teachers being assigned to Sessions 1, 2, or 3.    There are multiple opportunities for students to publicly demonstrate mastery of their craft. Our annual public  performance calendar contains over 50 different instrumental and vocal music performances, 8 major art  exhibitions/gallery shows, 12 major drama productions and four large scale all-school shows (Annual Musical, Opera,  Talent Showcase and Annual Gala). In addition, there are frequent additional music performances, which are held in  outside performing venues and galleries. For each major performance there are two single-period preview assemblies  for the student body.    In addition to our formal performances, the Drama Studio showcases classwork with events called “Drama Scenes.”  Each of the 3 cohorts per grade level hold an evening performance (12) per semester, which is open to the family  members and friends of the Drama students. There are approximately 24 drama scenes performed at night that  highlights in-class scene work.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Framework for Great Schools    According to the school’s 2016-2017 Quality Review, an area of celebration was the school’s culture. School leaders  and staff effectively communicate high expectations connected to a path to college and career readiness partnering  with parents. Teacher teams and staff establish a culture for learning that systematically communicates a unified set  of high expectations together with detailed feedback and guidance support for all students. Successful school-home  partnerships support students’ progress toward meeting high expectations for academic success. Students are  motivated to own their educational experience and support their peers so that they are prepared for college and  career decisions. This information is also reflected in the Student Learning Environment Survey.   A key area of focus is to use on-going assessment and grading practices, and analyze information on student learning  outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team and classroom levels. Our goal in every classroom, is to have  students and teachers have actionable feedback that is aligned to both content and practice standards and to be  aware of the criteria to increase achievement. Across grades and subjects, teachers will use the data and classroom  checks for understanding to make effective adjustments to curricula and to drive instruction.          After receiving the results from the School Learning Environment Survey, another key area of focus is to engage in  structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared leadership and  focuses on improved student learning. The goal is to further increase teacher collaboration across disciplines builds  leadership capacity, instructional expertise, and curriculum design and revision. Teachers’ input affects key school- wide decisions on student learning.                       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 03M485   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   2809   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

As formative assessment summarizes students’ development at a particular time, teachers will frequently check for  student understanding to inform their classroom instruction, providing opportunities for students to demonstrate their  knowledge of the specific skills and/or content taught during lesson. Based on the data gathered, during the lesson,  teachers will be able to address student challenges and/or misconceptions and to differentiate their instruction to help  students achieve the learning objective. Teachers will conclude with a closure activity, such as facilitating a quick review  to go over what students have learned (or should have learned) and use the information to identify next steps, continue  their lesson/unit planning, and revise upcoming tasks and/or assessments.

NA        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. LaGuardia High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   [School name] will support parents and families of Title I students by:       ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;    ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;    ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;    ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;    ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;    The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:    ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;    ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;    ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;    ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;    ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act;    ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;    ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;          Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:       ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;    ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;    ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;    ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;    ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;    ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;    ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;    ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;    ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The ENL teacher, Ms. Rochkind, creates baseline assessments at the beginning of the year to assess areas in need of  improvement.  The assessment includes reading comprehension, a writing component, and listening passage.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The ENL teacher shares this information with the student’s teachers to provide the strengths and weaknesses.  ENL students  have two stand alone classes and former ENL students have one stand alone class.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45         Teacher provides ELL Periodic Assessments and closely monitors each student’s progress in subject classes.  The teacher is  aware of all major assessments in academic classes, which include unit exams, midterms, finals, essays, and projects.  This  allows the teacher and student to the progress that has been made throughout the year.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The teacher has access to each student’s PupilPath account to monitor grades.  Teacher meets with subject teachers whenever  major assessments are given to properly ensure students are fully prepared and work specific areas.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The raw scores of the writing component of the NYSESLAT indicate this language modality is the weakest of all the four  modalities.  This is true for current ELLs as well as for former ELLs. Based upon student’s scores the teacher can assess areas in  need of improvement and what specifics must be focused upon in the future.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Information is shared with the LAP team and to find better ways to share information for each student’s current teacher and  assign the student to specific teachers to ensure the best academic matches for each subject area.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Entitled ELLs and former ELLs are programmed for ESL classes according to grade level and language proficiency.  Our  Entering students receive 2 periods of ESL and an additional period of English.  Our Commanding students receive 2  periods of English language support per week.  We do not have any additional student levels.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   The school team consisting of an assistant principal, guidance counselor, programming office, and ENL teacher work together  to ensure students receive the mandated number of minutes.  The school also has received compliance approval from MFSC to  ensure all mandates have been properly followed.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   The school only follows a Freestanding ENL.  Stand-alone ENL is instruction is provided to current ENL students to develop  English language skills so that students can succeed in core content courses. It is delivered by a certified ENL teacher.  Integrated ENL is instruction is provided to former ENLs to build English language skills through content area instruction –  social studies. It is delivered through co-teaching by a certified ENL teacher and a certified content area teacher. Integrated  ENL instruction include content area subject matter and English language development using ENL strategies.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      N/A      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Questions are scaffolded according to the students’ language proficiency levels.  Teacher previews content material from  social studies and English to identify material that may be considered too challenging for ELLs students. This material is  subsequently presented in different formats.  Vocabulary is pre-taught overtly.  Difficult language structures are amplified to  promote critical thinking while facilitating language acquisition.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ESL teachers use ESL methodology and language development is provided through the content areas.  Visual aids have been  helpful or students to learn best across subject areas.  The use of graphic organizers, sentence starters, T-charts, essay  outlines, images, and video clips have helped students better comprehend content specific material.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL-SWDs programmed are mainstreamed in all their subjects.  Prior to the school year, the programming office in conjunction  with supervision assistant principals create a schedule focusing on ENL and IEP students to ensure their needs have been  met.  The school ensure that before block periods are created that it does not interfere with students receiving mandated  supports – whether it is ENL services, SETSS, or ICT classes.  School monitors the progress of each subgroup to make sure that  they are making the same gains as general education students.  School has been designated a Reward School for three  consecutive years.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The ESL teacher works with students in content areas by providing instructional support in ESL methodology.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Not applicable because we only provide services for six ELL student.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Not applicable because we only provide services for six ELL student.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         All ELL students are afforded access to all school programs. Students are not restricted in any way to be part of any school  program.  Students’ schedules are planned in advance to ensure that there is no interference with the mandated minutes  received and studio classes to ensure that students have a complete LaGuardia experience.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We use ipad, different types of dictionaries, ESL textbooks in different content areas and electronic translators.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We provide translation when possible.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All services are provided to all ELLs through the ESL teachers, coordinator and guidance counselors.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We use ipad, different types of dictionaries, ESL textbooks in different content areas and electronic translators.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Not applicable because we only service the needs of six ELL student.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    All the elective classes are available to all ELL students which include Spanish, Italian, French, and Japanese.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable because we do not have a dual language program at our school.        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  We attend in-house training as well as PD offered at the DOE.  ESL teachers and AP provides support to content area teachers.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dr. Lisa Mars, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   F.H.
