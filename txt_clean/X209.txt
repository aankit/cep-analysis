This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   P.S. 209 serves as the anchor to future academic success through coherent rigorous instructional practices, creating a  safe and nurturing environment, and fostering a collaborative community that will establish each student's path  towards a love of learning and college and career readiness.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Behind the doors of Public School 209 you will find a genuine and diverse community of learners and educators that  continuously strive toward a higher standard of academic achievement and foster a healthy, safe, and supportive  learning environment.    P.S. 209 is committed to providing our children with an education that inspires them to dream big using their  imagination to reach their goals and find their passion in life. We plan to instill values in our children that teach them  to never give up on their future and always stay focused on what matters most. We will teach our children that they  have to actively seek out their life’s purpose and that success does not come without a tremendous amount of hard  work. We will assist our children in becoming good citizens who are committed to working together to improve our  world. We will show our children that failure is not an option and expect them to give 100% each and every day. We  will learn alongside them and hold ourselves accountable to putting our children first at all times. It is our mission to  transform the life of every child who attends P.S. 209 and open doors to opportunities they never knew were  possible. Our children will leave here college bound with the understanding that they can and will accomplish all of  their goals in life.    Our goal is to provide our students with additional cultural experiences to support and enhance our integrated  curriculum. These partnerships include Dance Waves, Striking Viking Story Pirates, LEAP, Fordham Library, Bronx Zoo,  and the Police Athletic League. The experiences planned with these partnerships immerse our students in areas of  study aligned with the standards based curriculum. Therefore, providing them with the tools necessary to be  successful in their units of study.    As per parent feedback, we are conducting monthly Learning In Action parent workshops during the 2018-2019 school  year for grades Pre K-2 across all curriculum areas. These workshops provide parents with information about their  child’s grade level standards (Next Generation), technology based resources, and the opportunity to view a standard’s  aligned lesson in their child’s classroom. The goal of each workshop is for parents to have a deeper understanding of  the major work of the grade in order to support their child at home.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   During the 2018-2019 school year we plan to host four six-eight week cycles of a before/after school program to  target the needs of our students in the bottom third of our population. The students will be grouped based on  differentiated areas of need in literacy and mathematics. Tiered instructional practices will be implemented for those  students who are identified as not meeting academic expectations.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Over the past two years we have made great progress in Strong Family Community Ties (Framework for Great  Schools) by implementing nine Common Core in Action Parent Workshops at each grade level. Parents are invited into  our school each month and take part in a classroom lesson with their child focusing on specific Common Core  standards. We are committed to building strong partnerships with parents and community members through these  educational opportunities. We plan to continue to make great progress by implementing parent workshops aligned  with the Next Generation Learning Standards. In addition, we plan to host one on one tutoring sessions with students  and their parents on Tuesdays after school in order to build the home-school connection and equip parents with the  tools needed to support their students at home. Our key area of focus for the school year is evidentiary support  (Rigorous Instruction). We believe that if teachers use the Conditions of Learning to plan and implement instruction  focused on teaching students to use evidence to support their thoughts, reactions and opinions to what they read and  what they write, then the students will read, think and explain their ideas, using textual evidence to support their  ideas. The students will also reflect on what they have read, their newly acquired knowledge or opinion and  demonstrate this through written responses that will illustrate their understanding of the author's central message.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         As a result, our Reading data end of year data (EOY) will increase by 3%, our Writing EOY summative data will increase  by 3%, and our Math EOY summative data will increase by 3%.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 10X209   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   256   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  At P.S. 209 we prepare students transitioning into elementary school programs by building a strong collaboration  between school and family through involving parents in hands on learning activities, community building activities,  student updates, and maintaining an open line of communication. Parents participate in academic workshops, which  are built upon in K-2. In addition, Pre Kindergarten assessments are shared with Kindergarten teachers and vertical  planning takes place throughout the school year. In addition, a Kindergarten orientation is provided to all incoming  Kindergarten students and their families prior to the start of the school year. This provides families an opportunity to  visit Kindergarten classrooms and discuss any questions/concerns they may have.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Our assessment design follows a cyclical model where assessment informs curriculum and instruction. In collaboration  with administration, teachers design an Assessment Guide, which outlines the assessments that will be administered  throughout the school year. This guide is revised on a cyclical basis. The Universal Literacy Coach along with School  Administrators provide one to one and grade-level monthly professional development to assist teachers in using  assessment data to plan instruction and set student goals using the Here’s What, So What, Now What protocol.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37        Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Public School 209 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Public School 209, will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students        Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;     Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      The school’s Parent Involvement      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program.

P.S 209’s supplementary language instruction program for English Language Learners (ELLs)  will include an after school ENL program. The program will focus on building students’ skills in  the areas of listening, speaking, reading, and writing through the use of creative language based  activities in order to support their language development.  Lessons and activities will focus on  building vocabulary and grammar as well as strengthening literacy skills throughout content  areas. ENL strategies will be incorporated such as the use of graphic organizers, hands-on  experiences, and visual cues to help students gain fluency in the English language. Materials  such as books on tape, listening centers, and hands-on language building materials will be used  to enhance student learning through interactive activities. The program will also focus on test  sophistication, to help the students become familiar with the format, skills and language needed  to be successful when taking formal assessments. Students will practice these skills by using test  sophistication workbooks. The program will run from March 2019 to May 2019. The session  dates will be as follows; 3/13, 3/15, 3/20, 3/21, 3/22, 3/27, 3/28, 3/29, 4/3, 4/4, 4/5, 4/10, 4/11,  4/12, 4/17, 4/18, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 5/8, 5/9, 5/10, 5/15, 5/16, 5/17. The program will meet three times  a week after school for one hour a day from 2:20 to 3:20 p.m. (25 sessions total) and will be  offered to all ELL students in grades K-2 ranging from entering to commanding ELLs.  Students  will be grouped based on their proficiency levels and instruction will be planned  accordingly.  All instruction will be in English with embedded entry points for ENL learners.  The program will be staffed by the ENL Coordinator as well as eight common branch  teachers.  The ENL Coordinator and common branch teachers will receive a per-session rate of  $50.13 per hour. The program will operate using a push-in model. In the cafeteria, the ENL  Coordinator will teach the main lesson to subgroups of students based on their proficiency level  and areas of need (30 minutes).  The common branch teachers will then transition the students to  the classrooms where they will work with a small group on an independent extension related to  the main lesson (15 minutes).  The ENL Coordinator will then push-in to the classrooms for an  additional 15 minutes to enforce ELL strategies and prompting.  Materials will  include NYSESLAT test prep booklets, teacher binders, student folders, pencils, lined paper, dry  erase tablets, and dry erase markers.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  P.S. 209 uses Fountas & Pinnell Running Records to assess reading and early literacy skills. The students are assessed 5-6 times  per year.  In addition, a baseline, midline, and endline exam is administered in the area(s) of writing and math.  These  assessments are used to monitor progress and plan data-based instruction. The ENL teacher administers a baseline, midline,  and endline to all the ENL students to assess them in the areas of Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing. The ENL teacher  also uses the NYSESLAT test scores from the previous year to see what area each student scored the lowest. Based on the 2017  NYSESLAT, the current ELLs scored the lowest in the areas of reading and writing.  This information will guide all instructional  planning.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49   All formative assessments are scheduled using a school-wide assessment calendar aligned to the scope and sequence.  Once  administered, students are grouped and re-grouped based on their levels and the ELLs are supported through small-group  lessons, early access to content-based immersion, and small-group Language Power lessons which are aligned to student’s  CCLS, ENL Standards, and ToMs.  Data is also analyzed and discussed during assessment meetings (including both  administrators and teachers).  Data analysis is used to plan integrated instruction required under CR Part 154.2.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Aside from classroom-based assessments, ENL-specific assessments are administered to all ELLs.  These assessments (baseline,  midline, and endline) are aligned to the ENL curriculum and NYSESLAT in order to plan standalone instruction in the areas of  speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Based on the September 2017 Baseline, the two areas of need for the Kindergarten  students are Speaking and Writing. 15/20 students scored a 0 or 1 on the Speaking portion and 20/20 students scored a 0 or 1  on the Writing portion. The two areas of need for the first and second grade students are reading and writing. 10/12 students  scored a 0 or 1 on the reading portion and 12/12 students scored a 0 or 1 on the writing portion. This data will be used to  guide instructional planning for the ELLs.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Standalone minutes are planned as a result of ELL summative assessments.  These lessons are structured to meet the needs of  the students while addressing both their strengths and weaknesses in the areas of speaking, listening, reading, and writing.  In  addition, ELLs are offered Extended Day opportunities (before or after school) in order to address individual needs.  The  Extended Day program allows for teachers to focus on an individual modality and/or area of need.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   K-2 classroom teachers use formative and summative assessments as a universal screening tool to determine which students  are in need of additional support across all subject areas.  Struggling learners are provided with interventions at increasing  levels of intensity to accelerate their rate of learning through small group instruction.  Tier l is the core of instruction. Two  teachers are in each classroom and the ENL Teacher supports her ELL students by pushing into the classroom or pulling a  group out of the classroom depending on their English Proficiency Level. Tier ll provides a double dose of instruction. A  certified pedagogue provides an additional period of fundations to those students who are struggling to master their letters  and letter sounds. Tier lll is intensive intervention. An after-school program is provided to students who are not meeting grade  level benchmarks. Each cycle of after-school runs for about 6-8 weeks. We have about 4 cycles of after-school per school year.  During this program, a Here's What, So What, Now What (HSN) report highlighting the current area of need, plan of action,  and results is developed for each student. In addition, both parents and administration are provided with an individualized  progress report citing the student's area(s) of need and progress throughout the after-school program. These documents are  then used to plan future ENL instruction.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSITELL (K) and NYSESLAT (grades 1-2) are used to evaluate and inform ELL programming.  Student levels (entering,  emerging, transitioning, and expanding) are created as a result of the outcomes of these assessments.   According to the 2017  NYSITELL and the 2017 NYSESLAT, 22% of ELLs are entering, 12% of ELLs are emerging, 16% of ELLs are transitioning, and 50%  of ELLs are expanding.  These levels are used for the scheduling, programming, and planning of ENL instruction.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   PS 209 has 2 certified ENL teachers to provide ELLs with integrated and standalone minutes based on their proficiency  level.  Student levels are also shared with classroom teachers to be considered when differentiating and scaffolding instruction  for ELLs.              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50       Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   PS 209 delivers ENL instruction to all ELLs through the use of a freestanding ENL program.  ENL students are placed in  heterogeneous classrooms.  Within these classrooms, integrated minutes are deciphered based on the student  proficiency levels. The ENL teacher pushes into the classrooms for ELA and/or a Core Content Area depending on the  student's english proficiency level. The co-teach model is used when the ENL teacher is  pushing into the classroom.  The ENL teacher works with a group of students depending on reading level and or english proficieny level. All of the  students in the group do not have to be ELLs. In addition, standalone minutes are also provided by the ENL teacher in  the ENL classroom.  These minutes are met by creating homogeneous groups based on grade level.  Together, this  programming allows for appropriate ENL instruction as per CR Part 154.2.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     At this time, based on parent surveys, there is no need for a TBE program.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      At this time, based on parent surveys, there is no need for a DL program.       2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   All ELLs are provided with the mandated number of instructional minutes through the use of integrated and standalone  instruction provided by the certified ENL teacher(s).  Entering ELLs are placed homogeneously and are provided with 180  integrated minutes and 180 standalone minutes (360 total).  Emerging ELLs are placed in heterogeneous classrooms (with  entering ELLs) and are provided with 180 integrated minutes, 90 standalone minutes, and 90 integrated or standalone minutes  (360 total).  Transitioning ELLs are place in heterogeneous classrooms and provided with 90 integrated minutes and 90  integrated or standalone minutes (180 total).  Expanding ELLs are placed in heterogeneous classrooms and provided with 180  integrated minutes and commanding ELLs are provided with 90 integrated minutes.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   All classrooms have 2 common branch teachers.  In addition to the 2 common branch teachers, an ENL teacher is assigned to  every ELL classroom to meet the integrated and standalone minutes under CR Part 154.2.  Within this setting, core content is  presented to ELLs in the form of immersion.  Immersion includes, but is not limited to, hands-on learning experiences, shared  experiences, read alouds, shared reading, field trips, and/or demonstrations.  Core content is delivered in English, providing  home language support(s) when necessary.  Content is differentiated in order to aid in comprehension and meet the demands  of CCSS through the use of multiple entry points such as sentence starters, student-friendly rubrics, word study, visual support,  tiered questioning, and/or self-assessments.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Newly admitted students who score below the cut scores on the NYSITELL and have a home language of Spanish are  administered the Spanish LAB to assess their native language proficiency. A bilingual pedagogue is also available to assess  students in their native language on formative and summative assessments that are used throughout academic areas.   Math  assessments are also available in Spanish.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    A. At this time, PS 209 does not have SIFE ELLs.  B. Instruction is differentiated for newcomers through the use of multiple approaches such as additional scaffolds,  Cambourne’s conditions of learning, and SIOP.  Through these models, ELLs are provided with multiple sentence starter,  language objectives, and visual supports in order to aid in their language acquisition as “new” ELLs.  C. At this time, PS 209 does not have developing ELLs.  D. At this time, PS 209 does not have long term ELLE.  Instruction is also differentiated for former ELLs, who have mastered the  language based on the NYSESLAT but aid in continued instruction to ensure a smooth transition.  Former ELLs are provided  with scaffolds such as talking points, student-friendly rubrics, and peer interviews to ensure their progress in a homogeneous  classroom.   E.  Instruction is also differentiated for former ELLs, who have mastered the language based on the NYSESLAT but aid in  continued instruction to ensure a smooth transition.  Former ELLs are provided with scaffolds such as talking points, student- friendly rubrics, and peer interviews to ensure their progress in a homogeneous classroom. Former Ells receive 90 minutes of  ENL in ELA/Core Content Area and testing accommodations for two additional years at the Commanding proficiency level.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL-SWDs are provided tiered, differentiated instructional strategies (such as e-dictionaries, word walls, visual supports,  directions read and re-read, and sentence starters) based on their needs and/or IEP goal(s)/accommodations.  They are also  provided with various forms of technology such as Smart Board Technology and enlarged iPads for teacher modeling and  hands-on experiences.  Teachers of ELL-SWDs scaffold lessons and activities, use pictures, manipulatives, and realia to develop  vocabulary, and include physical movement during instruction to accelerate English language development and make language  learning enjoyable and meaningful for ELL students.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Many ELL-SWDs are placed in an ICT classroom with added support from two content-certified teachers.  In addition, an ENL  teacher is provided to each classroom to support ELL-SWDs in meeting their IEP goals alongside language  proficiency.  Integrated minutes are provided parallel to the content-certified teacher(s) to ensure fluid instruction.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  In addition to regular ENL instruction and literacy instruction in their mainstream classrooms, both common branch and ENL  teachers also incorporate a variety of programs such as Language Power, Finish Line for New York ELLs, and iReady.  In  addition, ELLs who are not meeting the current benchmarks may qualify for our Reading Rescue and after school tutoring  programs. Students who qualify for the after school program receive supplemental one-to-one or small group instruction with  a focus on literacy and/or math. During after school, programs such as Fundations are used to support and build on the literacy  instruction that takes place in the classroom. Students who need extra support in math and/or reading may also receive  individualized instruction during guided math and/or guided reading. The classroom teachers work with small groups of  students and focus on student needs within the targeted content area.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      PS 209 will be adopting the Fountas & Pinnell Reading Intervention Kits in which will provide ELLs with more direct and explicit  instruction in the areas of reading and writing.  ENL teachers will also adopt the Making Meaning curriculum to address the  need for overall vocabulary development.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   According to the parent surveys and requests, there has not been a need for a bilingual program (less than 15 requests in one  or two contiguous grades).     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ll ELL students are able to participate in all school programs if they are eligible for the service. These programs include Reading  Rescue, after school tutoring and an ENL After School Program. All of our ELL students are eligible to participate in our ENL  after school programs. Once the program has been set up all ELL students will receive a letter explaining our ENL after school  program (days, times, instructional activities, etc.). The ENL teachers and Parent Coordinator are available to answer any  questions parents might have about the program. All program information, permission slips and sign up information is  available in English and the family’s native language. ELL students who are not meeting grade level standards in reading,  writing and/or math, or need extra instruction in these areas, are also eligible for our after school tutoring. Students who need  extra instruction in literacy and/or math work with a teacher 1:1 for 45 minutes after school to improve their literacy and/or  math skills. ELL students who are reading below grade level or are not making sufficient progress in reading are also eligible to  be tested for Reading Rescue services in the first grade. Students in Reading Rescue work 1:1 with the trained staff member for  45 minutes per day to boost confidence in reading and improve their reading skills. All information sent home is available in  both English and the family’s native language.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  To provide access to academic content and accelerate English language development, ELLs are provided with various forms of  technology such as Smart Board Technology and enlarged iPads for teacher modeling and hands-on experiences.  IPads contain  differentiated programs to target the modalities of speaking, listening, reading, and writing.  Programs include, but are not  limited to, A to Z Reading, Storia School Edition, IXL, Drops Language Learner, iReady, Kahoot, and Brain Pop Jr.  Together,  these materials ensure that students are provided with multiple entry points to the content being addressed.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native Language Arts are supported within the ENL program and the mainstream classroom through the use of native  language books, dictionaries and learning materials. ELL students are also paired with native English speakers who serve as  language peers to assist ELLs with language learning. If the need arises for a Transitional Bilingual program or Dual Language  program, every effort will be made to ensure that students are receiving these services. In the event that a Transitional  Bilingual program is needed, the program will be implemented through native language instruction throughout the content  area as well as ENL instruction. Native language literacy skills will be a focus with a strong ENL component. If the need for a  Dual Language program is needed, P.S. 209 will work to form a program that focuses on transferring second language skills by  developing a strong academic language base in the first language.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All required services and resources correspond to the ELL's grade, age, and ability level. Students are placed with students who  have similar focus areas or similar goals on the same grade level. Programs and services are geared toward the individual  student's needs and instruction is differentiated accordingly.  Common planning and teach team meetings amongst ENL and  classrooms teachers ensure that services and resources and appropriate and fluid for all ELLs.  In addition, to ensure that  services and resources correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels, all lesson plans and instruction is aligned to the students’  target(s) of measurement (ToMs), Common Core Learning Standards (CCSS), and the New Language Arts Progressions (LAPs).       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    PS 209 does not share a building.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Each year the staff at P.S. 209 opens the doors to our newly enrolled Kindergarten students and families during the week  before the first day of school. The "Kindergarten Meet and Greet" is an opportunity for the parents and students to come to  the school, meet with the child's teacher and become familiar with the school environment. During this time, teachers are able  to express their expectations and answer any questions parents might have about the new school year. Translators and the  language access line are used to assist parents who prefer a language other than English.  For students who enroll in the  middle of the school year, we provide an opportunity for the students and parents to meet and greet with the teachers before  the child's first day of school. During this time we review guidelines and expectations with the parents and student to ensure a  smooth transition. The student is assigned a buddy in their class who will help the them become acquainted with the  classroom procedures.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    PS 209 is a K-2 school.  PS 209 does not offer language electives.  All students participate in a Guided Reading block, Writing  block, and a block of Fundations (phonics program) daily      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A          Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  ENL teachers will participate in professional development opportunities and workshops provided by the districtand the NYC  Department of Education's Office of English Language Learners. Our teachers will also be receiving school based professional  development which will focus on curriculum planning, instruction and assessment for ELLs. Common branch, special education  and subject area teachers receive professional development through ESL workshops during professional learning team  meetings and PD opportunities on Chancellor Conference Days. Paraprofessionals, secretaries, guidance counselors,  psychologists, the parent coordinator and related service providers receive professional development during ESL workshops  provided throughout the school year. They also participate in professional development on the Chancellor Conference Days.  Non-pedagogic staff also receive professional development on Mondays after school. These workshops focus on improving ELL  instruction, supporting our ELLs, and school policies and procedures. Common branch, special education, and subject area  teachers also participate in SIOP trainings to meet the needs of the ELLs in their classroom.    All teachers at P.S. 209, including those who teach ELLs, are trained to support English Language Learners as they engage in the  Common Core Learning Standards. Teachers meet regularly to embed entry points for ELLs in literacy activities. Teachers  attend external professional development sessions that address the common core standards and turn key the  information during professional learning time.

These workshops include strategies for engaging and supporting ELLs.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All teachers at P.S. 209, including those who teach ELLs, are trained to support English Language Learners as they engage in the  Common Core Learning Standards. Teachers meet regularly to embed entry points for ELLs in literacy activities. Teachers  attend external professional development sessions that address the common core standards and turn key the information  during professional learning time. Teachers also address the common core standards as they relate to their ELL students during  weekly grade level professional development and common planning. Teachers who participate in an ELL after school program  also receive an additional 6-10 professional development sessions that focus on supporting ELLs.  Common branch, special  education and subject area teachers receive professional development through ENL workshops during professional learning  team meetings and PD opportunities on Chancellor Conference Days. Paraprofessionals, secretaries, guidance counselors,  psychologists, the parent coordinator and related service providers receive professional development during ENL workshops  provided throughout the school year. These workshops focus on improving ELL instruction and supporting our ELLs. Common  branch, special education and subject area teachers also participate in SIOP trainings to meet the needs of the ELLs in their  classroom. At the end of each Professional Learning Cycle, the ENL teacher will host a PD for all teachers on information that  she has learned from her monthly PD workshops. The PD will also include information on ENL instruction pertaining to our next  learning cycle. Also, at the end of each Assessment Cycle (every 6-8 weeks) the ENL teacher will meet with each grade team  to  review the ELL students, notice trends, and work on next steps.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Annual, individualized meetings with parents of ELLs are held on scheduled Tuesdays during the parent involvement time.  Student goals, language development progress, proficiency assessment results, and language development in all content areas  is discussed during these parent meetings. A translator is available for parents who prefer a language other than English.  The  language access interpretation line is also utilized during these times.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents are involved in the process of placing their children in an appropriate program. Parents attend an ELL parent  orientation at the beginning of the school year and are given information, in both English and Spanish, about the three  programs offered within the NYCDOE. In the beginning of the year, in addition to the mandated ELL parent letters, parents  received a letter from ENL teachers welcoming all parents to meet with them at any time to discuss the progress of their child.  Throughout the year the ENL teachers are in contact with the parents via parent meetings, which enables the ENL teacher to  provide parents with resources for ENL students and information about the current units of study. Throughout the year, the  Parent Coordinator and staff members run workshops (Common Core in Action) on the current units of study our students are  working on. The purpose of these workshops is to offer simple home activities for parents to use as they support their  children’s learning and view a lesson in their child's classroom. These parent workshops are translated from English to Spanish  for our non-English speaking parents.  Aside from these events, parents are also welcomed into the school at least two times a  month for special events such as perfect attendance assemblies, homework help, lending library, and/or math games.  All  activities are translated for parents who prefer a language other than English.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Anne Keegan, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S. 209                                                                              School DBN: 10X209  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      P.S.209 uses data to capture language preferences of all our parents. Through the analysis of the Home Language  Identification Survey, the student registration form, parent interview, student interview, and the emergency  contact form completed during the registration process, the school assesses the language needs of all students  and parents at P.S. 209. The school inputs the information gathered from these forms into ATS, which generates  the RPOB report. The RPOB report is analyzed to determine the spoken and written language preferences of all  our parents at P.S. 209. With the assistance of our Parent Coordinator, we are able to identify those parents who  need written information in another language, and assistance from interpreters, especially during Parent Teacher  Conferences.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59     2.

If a  certified pedagogue is not available and/or does not speak the preferred language, the Bronx Field Support Center’s  Over-The-Phone Interpretation line is used to communicate with Limited-English-proficient families. Each teacher will  be given the 1-800 Language Line number which will allow them to access 200 plus languages so they can speak to all  parents regardless of preferred language.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      The Language Access Coordinator (LAC) will turnkey the information learned at the training provided by the  Translation and Interpretation Unit on how to use translation services and over-the-phone interpretation services.  Copies of the brochures, guides, and over the phone interpreter services will be distributed to all staff members for  future use.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      A copy of the Parent Bill of Rights and Responsibilities will be provided to each parent in the preferred language of  their choice. A sign indicating the availability of interpretations services will be posted in a visible location near the  primary entrance to the school in the covered languages. The school safety plan will contain procedures for ensuring  that parents in need of language access services are not prevented from reaching the school's administrative offices  solely due to language barriers. Translation shall be obtained from the Translation and Interpretation Services for  signage and forms if the parents of more than 10% of the children speak a primary language that is not English nor a  covered language. All staff will use the Language Line to let the parents know that they can speak to staff in their  preferred language. This will allow staff to access 200 plus languages so they can speak to all parents regardless of  their preferred language.           Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       P.S.209 will use the Language Translation and Interpretation Parent Survey to improve translation and interpretation  services for families. If the survey needs to be given in a language not covered, the survey will be read to the parent  using over the phone interpretation. The survey results and feedback will be used to modify and create a seamless  and exemplary system to improve communication with all families.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62
