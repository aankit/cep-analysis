This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission Statement:    Section 4: CEP Overview      Vanguard High School is a community of learners committed to cultivating the resources necessary to become  literate, articulate, analytical, reflective and empathetic citizens. Respect for self and others is the motivating force  toward achieving our goal of becoming socially productive, useful and responsible members of society.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9                  2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Contextual Information:   Vanguard High School began twenty-one years ago as part of the Annenberg Initiative for School Reform, and the  Networking Project. Our school’s commitment is to the Coalition of Essential Schools (CES) and the New York State  Performance Standards Consortium. CES is a national organization, dedicated to helping all students achieve their  highest potential through nurturance, guidance, and providing the appropriate resources. Our commitment enables  us to create a school that has high expectations; possesses shared accountability between staff, students, and  families; is student centered; and uses performance-based instruction and assessment as the dominant method of  teaching, learning, and evaluation.   Habits of Mind   Vanguard High School is small and personal in approach. Working with an intellectual focus and helping students and  staff to “use their minds well”, our curriculum is developed stating the concepts, skills, knowledge and goals of year- long thematic courses. We use the Habits of Mind to plan curriculum.   In this process, students deepen their understanding of Habits of Work: punctuality, organization, cooperation,  revision and focus. While courses at Vanguard all cover unique content, one thing is similar throughout. This is the  focus on developing students’ “Habits of Mind”:   ● Using evidence: How well does the student use evidence to support his/her opinions or conclusions?   ● Considering Viewpoints: Does the student consider other points of view?   ● Making Connections: Can the students make connections between different topics, areas and courses?   ● Seeking Significance: Is the student able to see the relevance of our studies?   ● Asking ‘what if?': Does the student see various factors in an argument and ask what if something were changed?   ● Being Metacognitive: Can the student reflect on their own thinking process by being meta-cognitive?         Student Population:   Vanguard is a high school with 450 students from grade 9 through grade 12. The school population comprises 27%  Black, 60% Hispanic, 4% White, and 9% Asian students. Boys account for 47% of the students enrolled and girls  account for 53%.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The student body includes 8% English language learners and 24% special education students with 85% of students  placed in an integrated co-teaching setting and 15% of students with separate testing accommodations.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Framework for Great Schools   Progress and Area of Focus   According to our 2017-18 School Quality Guide, we earned 4.47 in Rigorous Instruction, a 4.60 Collaborative Teachers,  1.2 (Pedagogy), 2.2 (Assessment), and 3.4 (High Expectations). All of these were areas of celebration, and excerpts  from the Quality Review highlight the progress that we have made in each of these areas:   Excerpts from 4.2, Teacher teams and leadership development   [Framework Components - Collaborative Teachers, Effective School Leadership, Trust]      Findings    All teachers are engaged in consistently examining teacher practice and student data within inquiry-based structured  professional collaborations. Distributed teacher leadership is embedded across all areas of the school.    Impact    School-wide instructional coherence is seen throughout all classrooms and teachers play an integral role in key  decisions that affect teaching and learning across the school resulting in increased student achievement.       Excerpts from 1.2, Pedagogy   [Framework Components - Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment]      Findings    Across the vast majority of classrooms, teaching strategies strategically provide multiple entry points and high-quality  supports for all learners. Student discussion and work products reflect high levels of student thinking, participation and  ownership.    Impact    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      In the vast majority of classrooms, all students, including English language learners and students with disabilities, are  motivated and actively engaged in classroom activities and discussions, resulting in them producing meaningful work  products that prepare them for college and career.    Excerpts from 2.2, Assessment:   Findings    Across the vast majority of classrooms, teachers use assessments and rubrics aligned to the school’s curricula to  provide actionable feedback to students and teachers. Across the school teachers use common assessments to track  student progress and make adjustments to curricula and instructional decisions.    Impact    The monitoring of student progress at the teacher team and classroom level results in all students’ having a clear  understanding of their next steps for demonstrating mastery in all content areas and in increased student  achievement.       Excerpts from 3.4, High Expectations   [Framework Components - Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment, Effective School Leadership, Strong  Family-Community Ties]      Findings    School leaders consistently communicate high expectations to the entire staff. Staff has established a culture that  provides all students with clear, focused, and effective feedback, guidance, and ongoing support with college and  career.    Impact    A culture of mutual accountability exists between all staff members. Students are motivated to own their own  educational experience and support their peers so that they are prepared for college and career decisions.    Area of Focus – 1.1 Curriculum (Proficient)   [Framework Component - Rigorous Instruction]      *The following excerpt from the Quality Review highlights many positive aspects of 1.1; even so, the debrief clearly  indicated that we have room to increase our continuity between grades and subjects in terms of the curriculum maps  and how they illustrate rigorous standards while capturing modifications and adaptations for various groups of  students, including ELLs and students with special needs.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  In terms of teacher recruitment, Vanguard always seeks teachers who have experience with performance based  assessments. We approach our partner organizations to create "list serves" for vacancies with detailed descriptions of  the qualifications we seek. Specific organizations post our vacancies to a select teacher databases to attract teachers  who are familiar with our programs, including The New York State Performance Standards Consortium, Math for  America and Project Zero at Harvard.      Teacher teams create systems for mentoring that focus on support for new teachers. These systems include  collaborative processes for establishing and re-visiting teacher assignments as well as offering a wide range of  academic, social and emotional supports to maintain our excellent record of teacher retention.       Administrators, the Teacher Leadership Team and teacher teams all share responsibility for creating and seeking high  quality professional development to push teacher practice and student outcomes. Administration reserves budget  resources for professional development, including per session for after school experiences, per diem to cover  teachers to allow out of school visits and trips, and professional development funds to pay for high quality  professional development vendors, including ATLAS, the Teachers College Inclusive Classroom Project, the Academy  for Teachers, Lincoln Center Performing Arts, and the Foreign Policy Institute.      Base on our analysis of student data, specific departments also target specific teacher skills when recruiting teachers.  Examples include:      Hiring and training experienced literacy teachers for Reading/Writing Workshop and The Wilson Literacy Program:    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      • According to results from both the New York State ELA assessment and Vanguard’s self-administered Qualitative  Reading Inventory (QRI), 89% of students entering Vanguard are reading below grade level. Considering the fact  that there is a strong correlation between the literacy skills of students and their success in high school, Vanguard  has made a continuing commitment to improving the reading and writing skills of its students. The RWW team  initiated an inquiry project to investigate whether the Wilson Reading Program -- a nationally recognized multi- sensory language program for students who struggle with reading -- might improve the performance of this target  population. Wilson teachers created small classes of 5-10 students and focused on the essential components of  reading instruction (phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency and comprehension) to build students’  enjoyment of school through positive peer interaction and literacy experiences and greater school success. Ongoing  professional development is a primary feature of the weekly team meetings for our literacy department.    Hiring and training teachers to differentiate math curriculum and instruction for Lowest Third and Special  Education:    • The vast majority of students enter Vanguard significantly below grade level in mathematics (for example, 23% of  incoming students struggle with a conceptual understanding of multiplication and division and 53% struggle with a  conceptual understanding of fractions). To better serve those students who struggle the most, Vanguard made a  concerted effort to hire math teachers who were dual certified in math and special education. Two new hires have  dual certification, and ongoing professional development regarding differentiation is a primary feature of the  weekly math team meetings .         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Ongoing Professional Development    • Ongoing professional development regarding differentiation is provided for the entire staff on a regular basis  during full staff meetings, vertical team meetings, horizontal meetings and grade team meetings. The Special  Education Department also conducts regular professional development workshops on differentiation for the full  staff.    • All new staff members receive regular mentoring from experience teachers within our community. Mentoring  interactions are logged in via the Mentor Tracking System.    • All staff members participate in PD offered by the NYC Performance Based Consortium. This includes our  meetings on the Chancellor’s Day as well as regular Moderation Studies on exemplary PBATS and out own PBA  assignments and tasks.    • Regular professional development is taking place in vertical teams. The CCS team is currently leading the  Humanities, math and science teams in terms of unpacking the Common Core Standards, aligning our curriculum  maps to the Common Core and sharing/analyzing student work that exemplifies a direct connection to the selected  Common Core Standards for the 2011-2012 academic year.

N/A        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     1. As a Consortium school, our graduation level summative assessments must be based on the Regents-approved  PBAT rubrics. Based on these rubrics, our staff engages in teacher-led collaborative cycles of designing summative  and formative assessments, tasks and lessons. Staff engages in moderation studies at the Consortium, as well as  department meetings in which we norm our assessment practices. Student panels are assessed by multiple adults,  which offers another level of norming in order to ensure students are working toward high-quality challenging  achievements .         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH SHOWS A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN EFFECTIVE PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT AND  STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. THE OVERALL AIM OF THIS POLICY IS TO DEVELOP A PARENT INVOLVEMENT PROGRAM  THAT WILL ENSURE EFFECTIVE INVOLVEMENT OF PARENTS AND COMMUNITY IN OUR SCHOOL. THEREFORE  VANGUARD HIGH SCHOOL, [IN COMPLIANCE WITH ESSA], IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING AND IMPLEMENTING A  PARENT INVOLVEMENT POLICY TO STRENGTHEN THE CONNECTION AND SUPPORT OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT  BETWEEN OUR SCHOOL AND THE FAMILIES.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We give the QRI (Qualitative Reading Index) to every student who enters our school, and this test is administered at least three  times in every grade. The initial data from this test is shared with the entire staff, and we use it to create literacy supports for  all of our students, including ELLs. Most of our students arrive after scoring Level 1 or Level 2 in their ELA and Math  proficiencies in Middle School, and the QRI allows us to dig more deeply into actual literacy performance before we consider  support programs. All ninth and tenth grade students are required to take a Reading and Writing Workshop course each  semester, which is geared towards improving students’ foundational literacy skills. Because Reading and Writing classes are  especially small in size, teachers are afforded the ability to provide ELLs with extra attention. Moreover, those students with  very low proficiency levels in reading and writing are placed in the Wilson's Reading Writing Workshop program which consists  of even smaller class sizes and one-on-one attention.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Dedicated per session and time release for for QRI administration. Professional Development and dedicated budget line to  reduce class siz for implementation of Wilson.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The principal, data specialist and the ELL teacher meet regularly to examine the performance levels and growth of all ELLs. The  data we examine include classroom proficiencies, performance assessment data, NYSITELL, NYSESLAT and ELA Regents. We  track progress in terms of reading, writing speaking and listening proficiencies. We track student progress in classes via Jump  Rope, our online standards-based assessment tool that tracks proficiency and mastery levels in terms of skills and the Common  Core Standards. Revision of our interventions are considered every semester depending on the trends and patterns we see in  the data.              4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Dedicated per session for literacy PLCs to design, implement and track the success of literacy interventions.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Vanguard uses a number of interim assessments to inform instruction for students. In read and Writing Workshop and  Humanities classes, students are asses using the 6+1 traits of writing. Read and Writing Workshop also used the Qualitative  Reading Inventory (QRI) to assess students’ literacy abilities. The math department gages student understanding using regular  “understanding checks” (which are aligned with math proficiency standards), and the science department evaluates student  understanding using scientific inquiry/literacy checks. The Data Specialist works with departments to analyze data at the  individual class and grade level. Data is also disaggregated by ELL status (among other demographic variables) and teachers’  direct attention to skill, content areas, and student subgroups demonstrating challenges. We enroll students who perform at  the lowest levels and demonstrate persistent challenges in the Wilson literacy program and the Math Foundations program— each of which offers students supplemental reinforcement of the foundations. We believe the above system of using  assessment to determine interventions and teaching strategies ultimately makes content and language instruction more  comprehensible to students.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   2016-2017 NYSESLAT results reveal the following distribution of proficiencies among our ELLs: 10entering, 0 Emerging, 2  Transitioning, 16 expanding and 2 commanding. After conducting a comprehensive analysis of scores, we recognize that  students score highest on the speaking component, second highest on listening and lowest on reading and writing. There is a  clear pattern that emerges: while most students do fairly well on the listening and speaking parts of the NYSESLAT exam,  advanced students demonstrate greater competency in reading and writing. Therefore, students who advance from one  proficiency level to another (i.e. from transitioning to expanding) are more often those exhibiting improvement in their  reading and writing skills. Since reading and writing have been determined to be the highest priority areas in moving ELLs  forward, Vanguard puts and extra emphasis on the development of these skills in the earlier grades.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Dissemination happens at the weekly Teacher Leadership Team meetings and at the monthly full staff meetings. All staff  members have access to data via Google Docs.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57       Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Vanguard employs an Inegrated ENL program that uses dually certified teacers in content ares/ENL for students in  grades 9-12. ELL students receive all instruction in English with Native Language support by members of the LPT -  either during class or after school.  All ELL students are grouped for Integrated ENL classes. In the event that a ELL studentcannot be programmed in an  Integrated ENL class, we use the Push-In model to create co-teaching pairs (content teacher and ENL teacher) who  create shared lessons and teach together as a team.   By regularly assessing students and regularly taking part in training, teachers meet each student’s individual needs  though the modification and differentiation of instruction materials and practices.Members f the LPT provide  coaching and P support for all taff members regarding ELL modification of curriculum, instruction and assessment.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Not applicable.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not applicable.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              As per NYS law and Commissioner’s Regulations (CR) Part 154, ELLs at our school receive 180 minutes per week of  instruction per “unit” in classrooms with ESL licensed eachers. entering ELLs receive 3 units (540 minutes/week, 7 instructional  blocks); emerging ELLs receive 1 unit (360 minutes/week, 4 instructional blocks); trasitoning and expanding ELL students  receive 1 unit (180 minutes/week, 2 instructional blocks); and, commanding ELL students receive .5 units (90 minutes/week, 1  instructional block).     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Integrated ENL classes- and Push-In models when impemented - teach in English with Native Language support incorporated  into the curricular materials. Directions and performance based tasks are deliered in both English and Native Languages. Key  vocabulary in all content areas are also translated into Native Languages. Students make use of translation dictionaries in all  classes.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      NA - all evaluaions are administered in English.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         SIFE and Newcomer ELL students: ENL teachers in all content areas - using Push-In support for Reading Writing Workshop to  taylor the curriculum to the needs of entering/emerging ELLs. All support materials are made available in all content areas,  including digital books with read-aloud functions, graphic organizers/vocabulary units in both English and Native languages,  and dual language dictionaries/digital encyclopedias.  Developing an Long Term ELLs make use of all strategies/materials above, plus additional modification for ELA Regents  preparation. All ELA materials presented in both Englishand Native languages, including test preparation guides, novels, poems  and short stories.  Former ELLs attend after school tutoring two days eacweek, and the focus in on ELA preparation and PBAT support.Again, all  materials re made avaiable in both English and Native languages.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Several differentiation strategies are often used to assist ELL-SWDs. Teachers regularly teach these students vocabulary in  advance of coming lessons, provide them with high-interest/low-level books that portray important events using appropriate,  leveled language, prepare visuals with bubbles/spaces/sentence starters/visual clues provided as prompts for students to  capture their thoughts in writing, limits the number of problems that must be completed, and help them to verbalize an  answer or statement they know but are having problems communicating in English.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL-SWDs also receive support from Vanguard's Integrated Support Services (ISS) team. In addition to push-in support from the  ENL teacher, the students also receive support from special education teachers who push-in to classrooms as well. The  modifcations made for these students are similar to the differentiations made for ELLs mentioned above. Their materaisl are  printed in larger font, they are enhanced with focus point hihglighted or bolded and they are very visual.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  In addition to adaptive instructional programs and delivery for ELLs, we ensure that they are provided appropriate and  supportive instructional materials and technology. Students use various language-oriented websites (i.e.  mylanguageexchange.com) to practice their commination in English. Teachers offer ELLs high-interest reading materials at  different levels, manipulatives and assignments which require basic use of computer programs which facilitate skill-building in  word processing and organization.     Across both Mathematics, Science and Humanities instruction, teachers employ a set of interventions that are based on best  practices that have been shown to improve comprehension, English language development and achievement, which include  having students:  •     Use reading and learning logs to improve metacognition  •     Journal and personal reflection  •     Write summaries  •     Present information with visual representations  •     Provide answers and explain thinking processes  …and having teachers:  •     List instructions/process steps and review orally  •     Present information in varied ways (oral, written, demonstrations)  •     Frequently summarize key points  •     Repeat and paraphrase important terms and concepts  •     Provide word walls with vocabulary for each unit   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      •     Allow sufficient response time  •     Use cooperative learning     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      All ELL students take part in our after school enrichment program. The goal is to accelerate English language development and  improve achievement in content areas. The program seeks to serve a target population of 22 ELL students spanning grades 9  though 12. Title III funding will be used to support after school enrichment classes in Math, Science and Humanities (English  Literature and Social Studies combined).      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   At this point, there are no programs/services for ELLs that will be discontinued.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELL students invited to take part in our after school enrichment programs:  YMCA classes - Teens Take the City, NYS Senate debate  Liberty Partnership at Hunter - Tutoring, Health Awareness, Healthy Cooking, Green Team  Real Drama - Play Production, Activism Club  Mouse Squad  Girls Who Code  STEP UP  Glee Club, Dance Club, Philosophy Club, Guitar Club     All students, including ELLs, and invited to club fairs and ecouraged to choose at least one extension actvity each semester.  (75% of current ELL students are participating at the present moment)     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Across both Mathematics and Humanities instruction, teachers design materials that are based on best practices that have  been shown to improve comprehension, English language development and achievement, which include having students:  •     Use reading and learning logs to improve metacognition  •     Journal and personal reflection  •     Record their oral arguments for use in PBAs  •     Present information and PBAs with visual representations  •     Use technology (Delta Math, Virtual Science Lab, Audiology) to enhance language development  •     Use art and visual materials in PBAT prep (ATLAS Thinking Routines, multi-medium art supplies)  •     Use Powerpoint and Prezi and instructional and presentation tools for visual learners        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language supports are created for students performing below grade level, and the services are based on diagnostic  detail from specific exams and performances (QRI, NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, PBATs).     Students who score proficient on the NYSESLAT exam will continue to receive support for the 2 years following their score.  They will continue to be scheduled in the core calsses that have ESL push-in support. If they are scheduled to take the ELA  within those 2 years, these students will receive the accommodations due to them as former-ELLs (i.e. extended time, use of a  translation dictionary, separate location, and third reading of the listening passage).  Families will continue to receive all  material, forms, surveys and letters in both English and Native languages for no less than two years.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         All diagnostics are reviewed by administration and members of the LPT; programming needs are then communicated directly  to the Programming Team, led by Scott Livingstone our data specialist, to ensure services are in place for each ELL student  based on their age/grade/level/program needs.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Across both Mathematics and Humanities instruction, teachers design materials that are based on best practices that have  been shown to improve comprehension, English language development and achievement, which include having students:  •     Use reading and learning logs to improve metacognition  •     Journal and personal reflection  •     Record their oral arguments for use in PBAs  •     Present information and PBAs with visual representations  •     Use technology (Delta Math, Virtual Science Lab, Audiology) to enhance language development  •     Use art and visual materials in PBAT prep (ATLAS Thinking Routines, multi-medium art supplies)  •     Use Powerpoint and Prezi and instructional and presentation tools for visual learners        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Before the year starts, ELL students attend a bridge program in the summer that helps them understand the culture of our  school community. The summer bridge also allows members of the LPT to assign and grade diagnostic tests (QRI, speech,  numeracy) to new ELL students to identify areas of strength and areas of concern in terms of literacy, pragmatic speech and  written communication. We provide written and spoken translation service for students and parents who attend the bridge.     After coming to Vanguard, ELL students take part in every aspect of student life at Vanguard, including clubs. All of the  extracurricular actvities are language-rich environments that encourage growth in all four modalities.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish is currently the only language offered in our school. All students take the complete cycle of Spanish required by NYS -  unless they have an IEP and are exempt from the requirement (LOTE).     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Profesional Development in all content areas for ENL teachers is created by Jennifer Cruz-Flores for other members of the LPT  two times each semester. This year the meetings are scheduled for Tuesday afternoons as a part of our teacher time dedicated  to Professional Responsibilities.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         The members of the LPT can schedule full staff workshops or presentations throughout the year if necessary by requesting  presentation dates and times from the Teacher Leadership Team. Full staff presentations allow the LPT to share best practices  in terms of ELL support in the classroom.     All unit plans and lesson plans employ the lastest Understanding By Design templates which require all teachers to capture ELL  and ELL-SWD adaptations and modifications in their planning. Teacher teams are all required to make specific ELL  interventions in their curriculum, instruction and assessments - and to capture these plans in their lesson/unit planning in all  content area teams. All lessons and units - an all subject areas - are aligned to Common Core Standards.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The first and third meetings of he LPT professional development workshops (see #1 above) have 9  th   grade transition built  ino the agendas. The first meeting arranges meetings with 9  th   grade ELL students and our support staff, including social  workers, our guidance counselor and Liberty Partnership social work interns from Hunter College; they all create a "meet and  greet" sessions with ELL students and their parents to speal about school wide supports for 9  th   grade transition to high  school. During the third PD session, the same team conducts a "check in" meeting with the 9  th   grade ELLs to see if they are  making academic progress - and if they are making progress in terms of social/emotional goals with teachers, staff members  and peers. The LPT assists all staff involved in the 9  th   grade meetings by providing PD on best practices for supporting  successful transitions for new ELL students.    To sustain our ELL program, we make ELL professional development a high priority. This school year teachers prepared a 3 part  series of in-house professional development activities around differentiation with the aim of developing a usable catalogue of  best practices for ELL students. Because our PD sessions are 1.5 hours in length, teachers received a total of 4.5 hours of ELL  training.    The members of the LPT have an additional 4 hours of in house ELL PD (see #1 above). The LPT members also attend ELL  workshops that are created by the NYS Performance Standards Consortium every year (meeting dates and times vary; these  workshops provide another 5-8 hours of PD for our ENL teachers.  All notes and minutes from these PD sessions are recorded in teams and sent digitally to administration. The principal keeps  the records and maintains the digital files and also prints hard copies for the Professional Development Folder kept in Room  400.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Advisors schedule individual parent meetings for this purpose, Parents are called personally to set up the one hour  conferences, which include narratives from all content area teachers. One member of the LPT and one administrator alos  attends the meetings. Dates and time vary, but all meetings must be completed in the first twi months of school.         2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   ELL parents are invited (via letters, parent newsletter and backpacked announcements - all provided in English and Native  languages) to participate in all parent activities, including the School Leadership Team and the Parent Association.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, William Klann, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      To assess our school’s written translation and oral interpretation needs, we poll parents to identify those who  require parent translation. Information on the translation needs of families if recorded and stored in our internal  database with contact, emergency, and demographic information. We also review ATS (RCPL) to create a list of  parents of non-ELLs who prefer to be contacted in a language other than English.       Vanguard holds monthly meetings of Parent Teacher Leadership Team (PTLT) to develop programming that will  promote and enrich parental communication and engagement in all languages. The Vanguard Parent Engagement  Team plans to hold bimonthly activities i.e. workshops, discussions and special celebrations that foster parent   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      involvement at the school level. Translation is provided for Spanish speaking parents for both written materials  and during student/parent/advisor conferences.    All parents in the school system complete a Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS). This survey helps identify  students who may have limited English language proficiency due to the primary language spoken in the home.  Students are also given an informal interview, with the ESL teacher, in which the student is asked various  questions pertaining to previous education, countries of origin, interests/hobbies and goals/aspirations. Once  potential ELLs are identified, if they are new to the NYC Public School system, they are administered the revised  Language Assessment Battery (LAB-R) test within ten days of enrollment; administration of the LAB-R is done by  the ESL teacher, Jennifer Cruz. We use LAB-R results to determine which students are entitled to ESL program and  services and to inform instructional programs. If a student has already been enrolled in a NYC Public School, the  data specialist and ESL teacher use ATS to determine ESL services required for the students. Using these data  collections, we analyze the students' NYSESLAT scores and city/state assessments to determine the students'  progress annually.    The HLIS is the first step in parental involvement; it is sent to the child's home in both English and the student's  first language. During school orientation and our summer bridge program, parents are educated about our  freestanding ESL immersion program aims and processes, instructional approaches and practices, and available  language support. A translated overview is also provided to non-Native English speakers. Before the start of the  academic year, entitlement letters, Parent Survey and Selection Forms are sent to parents in both English and the  language identified in the HLIS. Once these are returned, students are scheduled for the appropriate ESL support  classes. If forms are not return, administrative personnel contact the homes to speak to the parents and to give a  friendly reminder to complete the forms. Only 5 of our ESL students’ parent did not choose to participate in our  ELL program.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.
