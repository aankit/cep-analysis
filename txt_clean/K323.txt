This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The school’s mission is to facilitate a learning climate which supports the educational needs of all students, including  English Language Learners, special education students, and high achieving students to achieve academic foundation  essential for success in high school, college and life. Our school motto is “I am a winner and an achiever! I am gifted,  talented, and smart! We are a team of winners, because we work hard together!” In addition to offering a rigorous  and challenging curriculum, P.S./I.S. 323 also offers a wonderful arts program.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   As per the school’s 2015-2016 Quality Review and Quality Snapshot the following identifies the school’s strengths  and areas of growth:   Student Achievement   ● 91% is the average pass rate for course in math, English, social studies, and science.   ● 77% of the school’s former 8 th graders earn enough high school credit in 9 th grade to be on track for high school  graduation.   SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT   ● 91% of students feel that their school offers enough variety of programs, classes, and activities to keep them  interested in school.   ● 98% of parents are satisfied with the education that their child has received.   ● 93% of teachers would recommend this school to parents.   ● 86% of students feel safe in the hallways, bathrooms, locker rooms, and cafeteria.   AREAS OF GROWTH   The New York State Department of Education indicated that our school has exceeded established targets with respect  to Student Progress.

In summary Student Achievement across the school on The New York State English language Arts and Mathematics  Test is approaching mandated target. The school’s objective for the 2018 – 2019 School Year is to have Student  Achievement ranging from meeting to exceeding the targets established for the school.   Quality Review Findings -    As per our 2015 - 2016 quality Review, assessment feedback has yet to reach the level of specificity to provide a clear  portrait of student mastery.   With regards to engaging in structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes  shared leadership and focuses on improved student learning, the school’s 2015 - 2016 Quality review generated a  rating of Well Developed. However,with regards to Instruction (Proficient) the findings suggested the following :  Develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best that is informed by the  instructional shifts and Danielson's Framework for Teaching, aligned to the curricula, engaging, and meets the needs  of all learners so that all students produce meaningful work products.

With regards to engaging in structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes  shared leadership and focuses on improved student learning, the school’s 2015 - 2016 Quality review generated a  rating of Well Developed. However,with regards to Instruction (Proficient) the findings suggested the following :  Develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best that is informed by the  instructional shifts and Danielson's Framework for Teaching, aligned to the curricula, engaging, and meets the needs  of all learners so that all students produce meaningful work products.

Retention and Support   In our efforts to retain highly qualified teachers and ensure they have the support and strategies to grow  professionally, we are highly invested in professional development. We offer professional development to teachers  on current topics provided by other teachers, administrators, as well as support staff from our network. Mentoring is  implemented as per teacher requirements.   We believe in an individual professional development plan specifically designed to focus on each teacher’s needs.  Teachers are active participants in the process and collaborate with administrators to review their goals and monitor  progress and development. Each teacher will develop an individual Improvement Plan in accordance with their  continual self-assessment mainly to move towards a highly-effective practice. The Danielson’s Framework for Teacher  Effectiveness (2007) will be used as a professional course of study.   All professional development is researched and evidence based. Research Based Strategies are emphasized  throughout our trainings. Inter-visitations are encouraged for all teachers as well as participation in external  professional development opportunities.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)           1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   456,000.00     36,359.00     0     0   3,422,653   X     N/A     N/A     N/A     X      Column B   Section Reference(s)  12,14,17,20 and 23     N/A     N/A     N/A     12,14,17, 20 and 23     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS/IS 323, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       [P.S./I.S. 323] will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Early literacy skills of ELLs are assessed with Fountas and Pinnell three times a year.  Teachers use Fountas and Pinnell to  identify the instructional and independent reading levels of all students and document student progress through one-on-one  formative and summative assessments.  Fountas and Pinnell illustrates students’ awareness of phonics, listening, writing and  oral expression. Teachers also have weekly and monthly benchmarks for their class. Results indicate whether or not students  have fundamental skills in reading and writing.  These types of assessment tools are critical for successful planning, grouping  and providing differentiation of learning.  This assessment has given insight into the lack of prior knowledge and vocabulary  needed in order to fully comprehend some of the passages on standardized assessments.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         In accordance with school policy, teachers must maintain an updated Data Binder which includes results of formative  assessments given throughout the year.  This includes teacher-created assessments and results of standardized  assessments.  In addition, formative assessments given by the ENL teacher must be included.          3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  NYC Performance Tasks, ELL Periodic Assessment, benchmarks in Go Math and MOSL are used to identify baseline, progress  and areas of need.  Although the ELL population does not make an AYP category due to the number of ELLs, Overall, their  achievement is in line with the achievement of the rest of the P.S./I.S. 323 population.  We have high expectations of our ELLs  and in fact for recent years, the valedictorians were former ELL students.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We have a number of interventions stuctures in place once the summative data has been gathered.  For starters, students are  identified and discussed in teacher-led inquiry groups.  Alongside administration, teachers place students in groups to receive  Response to Intervention (RTI).  This early identification and support of students with learning and behavior needs is  paramount to making sure ELLs don’t fall behind.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The school uses data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention framework.  The framework is essential  in providing ELLs with rigorous, culturally responsive instruction.  The guideline has been designed to assist teachers,  instructional leaders, and ELL support services.  Educators respond to the type and intensity of intervention needed.  It begins  at rigorous instruction.  As a school, instruction is rigorous and based on evidence in the development of ELLs.  When it is seen  that the student requires more intervention, the school gives them a “double dose”.  This simply means extra attention,  activities, and experiences and given to ELLs to target the learning experiences needed.  The final step of intervention is  intensive and individualized instruction.  Students receive this type of intervention in after school and in AIS throughout the  day.  Teachers collaborate between content area and the ENL teacher to create a learning community that is knowledgeable  and experienced in researched based Instructional Strategies. The math coach works closely with teachers to support rigorous  instruction.  The math coach also provides intervention services to whole classes. As a school we incorporate all language  modalities during lessons (as per Common Core).     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The ENL teacher has seen distinct patterns on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT.  Students tend to score at least one level higher on  the speaking and listening section as compared to the reading and writing section.  In addition, advanced students have  difficulty in critical thinking and analysis.  They have problems drawing conclusions and inferencing when  reading.  Intermediate and Beginner students are more inclined to encounter unknown vocabulary and have problems with  facts and details. Other patterns found were with regards to moving up a level.  On average, entering/emerging students move  up two level by the next school year.  However, the transitional/expanding students tend to take a little while longer to move  up a level.  Our rationale is that since the NYSESLAT is a comparable to the Common Core aligned ELA, results of both show  that overall students have issues in critical thinking; critical thinking and analysis being an expanding/commanding level  feature.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teacher meets with the principal to discuss findings and changes necessary for maximum students achievement.  The  ENL teacher then meets with teachers across grade levels during common prep periods and/or teacher-led  inquiry.  Adjustments to the program are only successful if all parties meet using all the student's data.         Part IV: ELL Programming  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57        Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   As per CR Part 154, there are 2 types of ENL:  Standalone and Integrated.  Standalone instruction helps ELLs to  develop English language skills so that students can succeed in core content courses.  It is delievered by the ENL  teacher Ms. Brathwaite.  Integrated ENL instruction builds English language skills through content area instruction.  It  is delivered by the ENL teacher and the content area teacher.  ENL strategies are used.  For the elementary level at  PS/IS 323, ENL is delivered via the Push-In model and the Pull-out model.  For Push-in, the ENL teacher plans carefully  with classroom teachers to ensure curricular alignment.  The planning and articulation are documented.  The classes  are organized to ensure that students receive instruction tailored specifically to their needs.  In this way the ENL  teacher can differentiate instruction more appropriately and make certain students get what they need.  The push-in  model is also used to reinforce content missed.  The ENL teacher works with ELLs during content instruction in  collaboration with regular classroom teachers to provide language acquisition and vocabulary support while retaining  content instruction time.         b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Not applicable   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not applicable      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Entering students receive 360 minutes of ENL which includes 180 minutes standalone and 180 minutes integrated.  Emerging  students receive 360 minutes of ENL which includes 90 minutes of standalone, 180 minutes integrated, and 90 minutes of  flexibile time.  Transitioning students receive 180 minutes of instruction which includes 90 minutes integrated and 90 minutes  of flexible time.  Expanding students receive 180 minutes of ENL all of which is integrated.  Commanding students receive 90  minutes of ENL all of which is integrated.  HLA is delivered through Performing Arts class called Hispanic Heritage  Club/International Club which is 90 minutes per week in grades 4-8.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   The goal of our ENL program is to foster full English proficiency in a supportive classroom environment to the demands of  Common Core Learning Standards. Both the ELA and ENL teachers that work with our ELL in the ENL program are fully  certified.  In order to help students to progress, we utilize the following practices:•               Collaborative planning between  ENL and ELA teachers for each unit.•               Scaffolding is an essential part of the instructional delivery, such as Modeling,  Bridging, Schema Building, Contextualization, Text Representation and Metacognition.•                Assisting students during work  periods, Conferencing with students in and out of class, informal assessments, and running records.•               Additional small  group AIS sessions for each grade prior to all state assessments, to focus on literacy and academic language. Beyond explicit  ENL, collaboration between teachers means that there is a consideration for the language needs of ELLs. Some aspects of this  policy include: •               Content area teachers monitor the understanding of linguistically challenging material and use a  variety of phrasings and synonyms to clarify meaning.•               Math teachers devote extra class time to untangling difficult  word problems, and require students to make verbal explanations of the problems they work on.•               Social Studies  teachers scaffold their instruction with visual aids such as maps, atlases, and illustrations to increase  comprehension.  Differentiation occurs through curriculum content, the learning process, the end product, and the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      environment.  Differentiation must occur for ELL subgroups as well.  Lessons are scaffolded in depth and complexity allowing  students to understand and apply knowledge in ways that make sense to them.            4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   The content area instructional component provides grade and age level appropriate instruction in the required content area  subjects in the native language (Spanish, Arabic and Haitian Creole) and English, in a systematic and structured way, and is  designed to develop the cognitive skills of limited English proficient pupils.  The ENL teacher provides content area support for  ELLs by aligning instruction with the social studies teacher and science teacher.  Home language support is provided with  bilingual books in social studies and science.  Home language is also supported during Performing Arts class (Hispanic Heritage  Club/International Club).      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.  Currently, there are no SIFE students.  However, when there is, there is an urgency to provide academic intervention  services as an extension of the regular school program.  In order to do this the ENL teacher makes an individualized student  needs assessment, create an AIS plan for the student focus on the literacy and math component, grade appropriate  instructional support materials, and differentiate instruction in all areas.  In addition, staff will receive professional  development on SIFE students and strategies that benefit the SIFE within your classroom instruction. b.  When new student  registers in our school, we provide the following resources to facilitate the transition:•               An informal student  orientation•               Buddy system identifying a similar student in his/her class that will assist during the  day•               Encourage student to participate in After School activities.•               An informal assessment to provide to identify  possible Academic Intervention programs.•               Home school communication.Moreover, since NCLB requires ELA testing  for ELLs after one year, our schools uses tests such as the periodic assessment from Pearson to prepare for such  examinations.   c.  The group of ELLs that sometimes gets ignored is the ELLs receiving service for 4-6 years.  This group of ELLs  is no longer newcomers and because listening and speaking proficiency is high, teachers sometimes forget that they are still  learning English.  In order to provide the best quality of education for this group, there must be differentiation in  instruction.  In order to do this, we create language rich instruction.  Our policy also includes:•               An after school  program, targeting reading and writing three days during the week.•               Offering a variety of clubs to middle school  students including Spanish club taught by the ESL Teacher to support ELA instruction.  d.  Long term ELLs are often ignored in  their content area classes because of their proficiency in speaking.  An analysis of their scores on the NYSESLAT, ENL, and Math  assessment suggests that their problem is one of reading and writing.  Our action plan for this group involves.•               An  after school program, targeting reading and writing three days during the week.•               Monitoring the progress of students  in all content areas to differentiate instruction for literacy needs. e. Former ELLs are an important aspect of the ELL  population.  They need to be monitored two years after receiving instruction.  Teachers are aware of ELLs who have received  proficiency on the NYSESLAT and pay attention to these students in case they need additional help in the form of after school  or AIS.           6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our policy for special needs students includes:•               Ensure that teachers of students with an IEP are familiar with students’  particular needs and all services are provided accordingly to the IEP mandates.•               Collaboration between the EnL  teacher and IEP contact person.•               Monitoring newcomer and SIFE student for possible special needs  status.•               The delivery of AIS services after school.Since English language learners with disabilities face many obstacles  when reading literature in English we have developed practices that will help them overcome these issues.  The inquiry team  implements AIS services for targeted students providing them with appropriate remediation strategies to increase reading and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      comprehension ability.  The inquiry team identifies these students and pulls them in small groups.  ELLs with disabilities receive  one on one attention as well.  In addition, the Pupil Personnel Team (PPT) meets on a monthly basis to discuss and come up  with solutions to academic issues seen in the classroom with ELL-SWD students.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The school meets curricular and instructional needs by allowing for flexibility in the ENL schedule.  The special education  teacher and ENL teacher along with any other teacher or teacher's aid associated with the student track progress.  During the  annual IEP meeting, teachers will discuss goals with parents.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  In order to assist our students in both academic achievement and assessment in ELA, math and other content areas, there are  a variety of intervention services that we are working with this year. All ELLs receive small group instruction with teachers, AIS  or the coach.  All ELLs participate in the After School program as well.  Targeted interventions for ELA includes differentiated  instruction based on the RAI, teacher assessments and previous year’s ELA scores.  AIS teacher then uses small groups and  ansillery materials to target specific skill areas.  Students have the opportunity to work one on one and in small group  settings.  Targeted interventions for math include differentiated instruction based on diagnostics such as the RAI, teacher  assessments and previous year’s math scores.  The teacher uses Continential Mathematics, ansillery materials and teacher  created Common Core assessments to target specific skills.  Targeted interventions for social studies and science include  teacher based self assessments.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Data shows that there is a long term benefit of early childhood education, particularly for low-income children.  Beginning in  the 2017-2018 school year, New York City will offer free preschool for all 3 year olds.  The program is starting in District 7 and  District 23.  Our school will be one of the few in the city offering free preschool for all 3 year olds.  This will greatly change the  literacy experience of those students in Kindergarten and beyond.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Not applicable     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs- curricular and extracurricular.  School programs include Performing Arts  (International Club, Dance Club, Basketball Club, and Art Club), holiday assemblies/shows, Broadway Junior, Disney Junior,  District Spelling Bee, District Art Contest/Show, After School, zero period tournaments, double dutch, basketball, CHAMPS and  the Beacon Program.  There is 100%  ELL participation in all curricular activities. There is heavy participation in the Beacon  Program.  After school programs are funded through Title I.          12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials used are aligned and/or support the Common Core Curriculum.  As per Common Core, dependent on  grade Ready Gen, Go Math, Code X, and Connected Math are used.  In content area such as Social Studies, the textbook United  States History by Holt McDougal is in English/Spanish.  Teachers also use supplementary materials to develop vocabulary and  learning experiences in general.  Technology provides ELLs with a variety of visuals and interactive learning.  At P.S./I.S. 323  there is an abundance of technology and technology support. There is a Smart Board and desktop computers and laptops  accessible in every ELL classroom.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         There is a large Native language library and a number of educational bilingual DVDs that students use for support.  Students  also supported through Performing Arts (International Club) offered.  The Parent Coordinator, Mr. Kenneth Williams is another  support system used.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    ELLs who received a proficient on the NYSESLAT continue to receive support for at least two years.  These former ELLs are  identified in ATS by all pedagogues in the building and are closely watched throughout their transition.  The are many testing  accommodations that ELLs receive.  They include time extension, separate location, third reading of listening section on the  ELA, and use bilingual dictionaries.  Newcomers are supported via the buddy system and through ELLs and Former ELLs in the  building.  Students in both middle school and early grades have the opportunity to join a variety of extracurricular activities to  support their English language learning experiences.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Instructional materials used are aligned and/or support the Common Core Curriculum.  As per Common Core, dependent on  grade Ready Gen, Go Math, Code X, and Connected Math are used.  In content area such as Social Studies, the textbook United  States History by Holt McDougal is in English/Spanish.  Teachers also use supplementary materials to develop vocabulary and  learning experiences in general.  Technology provides ELLs with a variety of visuals and interactive learning.  At P.S./I.S. 323  there is an abundance of technology and technology support. There is a Smart Board, desktop computers and laptops  accessible in every ELL classroom.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELLs take part in our buddy system.  Our school takes great effort to ensure ELLs never feel isolated.  Many new  ELLs join the Performing Arts International Club which puts on an assembly during the first month of school during Hispanic  Heritage Month.  During that time many newcomers are introduced to other ELLs and Former ELLs in the building.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish elective is offered to ELLs.  Spanish speakers make up at least 70% of the ELL population at P.S./I.S. 323. Having the  opportunity to take Spanish is a great way to support the native language.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   There is no dual language program at P.S./I.S. 323.        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The LAP team consists of Principal Linda L. Harris, Assistant Principal Ms. Shawna Miles, Math Coach Mr. Keith Bailey, English  Teacher Ms. Jannell Jones, ENL teacher Ms. Shari Brathwaite, Technology Teacher Ms. Samone Thompson, Parent Ms. Donna  Allwood, and Related Service Provider (Speech teacher) Ms. Kalimah Muhammad.  These team members support the staff in  order to best service our ELLs.  School staff, community learning support personnel organization, provide professional  development.  School Staff focuses on a variety of ELL needs.  Primarily, the literacy needs of our ELL population within the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         Common Core Curriculum. Sessions are also given in Math and Science in scaffolding instruction through the use of  manipulatives and experiments. Furthermore, technology sessions instruct content area teachers how to use online resources  to make instruction more comprehensible.  The support personnel takes workshops by teachers on our ENL teacher that  include: scaffolding in the content areas, native Language Literacy Development, differentiation in the ENL classroom, ENL in  the Mathematics classroom.  Our ELL teacher attends a variety of off-site workshops to promote collaboration between  content area and language teachers. Quality Teaching Workshops and various workshops offered through BETAC and the  Office of English Language Learners.  City-wide professional development regarding Common Core is offered to teachers of ELL students.  Many teachers take  advantage of MSQI professional development.  All teachers of ELLs attended ReadyGen, CodeX, Connected Math, and Go Math  Common Core Curriculum sessions.  There are still sessions related to ELLs and Common Core offered throughout the  year.  The ESL teacher will be in attendance of those sessions and Common Core professional development offered through  the Network.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The transition from elementary to middle school and from middle school to high school can be rather difficult.  The guidance  services are a source of valuable information.  Many of the high schools that our ELLs attend already have an abundant  amount of ELLs there.The school provides professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically  addresses the needs of English language learners.  A minimum of 15% percent of the required professional development hours  for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 80 must dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co- teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English Language Learners.  The ENL teacher provides  this professional development to the staff either during professional development Mondays or a lunch and learn.   For the ENL  teacher, a minimum of 50% of the required professional development hours is dedicated to language acquisition in alignment  with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and  content instruction for English language learners.  The ENL teacher receives professional development via the Office of English  Language Learners, P-credit, UFT, or annual/bi annual conferences such as NYSTESOL and TESOL.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Since only a portion of a student’s day is spent in school, parental involvement is key to the successful development of  students.  Here at P.S./I.S. 323, we understand the value of parental involvement and hold our parents (along with ourselves  and the students) accountable for student achievement.  In the triad of parent, student, teacher, parents are the  foundation.  Therefore, we orient the school year around educating our parents with a variety of workshops and classes.  For  instance this year there will be two workshops centered on the NYSESLAT preparation and other state exams.  Parents will  have the opportunity to ask questions and share their ideas and concerns.  Workshops are open to parents of former ELLs as  well.  Workshops and gatherings are excellent ways of assessing the needs of parents as well as developing shared  priorities.  Traditional workshops are parent centered so we like to take the round table approach. Parents are encouraged to  share and take on important roles at the workshops.  The PTA is a vital factor in developing the parent-student-teacher  relationship.   The parent coordinator markets different functions we hold at school and is the contact to the parent leaders at  the school.  As most schools do, we are looking to boost parental involvement every year.  The parent coordinator assists in  providing translation services for the parents for all letters home and activities taking place at the school.  Furthermore, the  parent coordinator evaluates the needs of parents using informal and formal questionnaires.  Parents are asked what kinds of  activities they would like to see.   The school also provides parents with the opportunity twice a month to visit the child in the  class while they are working as well as every Tuesday.  In addition, a group of teachers including the ENL teacher host a parent  engagement celebration on the last Tuesday of every month.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62                     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   ELL parent involvement at 323 is on the incline.  Parents are invited to attend the weekly Parent Engagement and month  Parent Engagement Celebration.  Parents come out to participate hands on so many of the workshops are product or service  based.  For example, last year the "Cluster" team held a Zumba class to address Hispanic Heritage Month and fitness needs of  the parents.  The children of the parents were allowed to stay and workout which provided necessary childcare.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Linda Harris, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   323                                                                              School DBN: 23K323  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Our objective, when conducting assessments, is to find out how many families are in need of translation services.  We initiated this by first conducting a Home Language Survey for families. The survey was created to inquire as to  the number of materials parents typically read and in what languages. We also scanned our data file for families  who HLIS indicated that more than one language was spoken in the home, ATS reports (RAPL, RCPL), and Student  Emergency Contact cards. Based on the responses we received and other numerical data (regarding population  and percentages), we assessed that we have a small Spanish speaking population in need of written translation.  This written translation was mostly in the form of school notices and teacher notations in regards to homework.  Our parent coordinator has also been a bridge between the concerns of our parents and our institution as a  responsive unit. Translation services are utilized during important meetings and conferences between parents,  guidance counselors, evaluators, and teachers. Most of the parents preferred school notices and notes home  from teachers or the office in their native language. The majority of parents are English speakers but we also have  a small Hispanic population. There is an even smaller Haitian Creole, Chinese, Arabic and Bengali population. To  accommodate families we have used all available bilingual personnel for the use of written translations of all   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      office documents. We have a trained staff in regards to both recognizing and responding to the needs of bilingual  families in the classroom. Sensitivity training and materials have been present to staff in regards the methods and  means in which they may have materials translated as needed. We are constantly assessing ourselves and well as  are changing population to ensure that our approach is successful. In response to the request for oral translations  during meetings and conferences with counselors, evaluators, and teachers we have responded favorably.  Licensed supportive staff, as well as, community volunteers has dedicated their time in an effort to accommodate  the specific schedules of families. Professional development meetings (other than the mandatory ones) have  served as a platform to voice and address growing concerns of the community regarding oral translation.  Meetings, whether during school, after school, or on Saturdays have been conducted to further the dialogue  between bilingual families and staff. Should such a situation arise, where a more experienced guidance is needed  on a bilingual compliance issue, we feel confident that we can depend on our CFN bilingual liaisons will be able to  guide us.         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Staff will receive a copy of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 at the first Staff Development meeting in September.  Teachers and other staff members will be made aware that providing these services are obligatory. The poster for the  translation services numbers will be located in the main office. Staff will also know who the Language Access  Coordinator for the school year will be.
