This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of Walter Francis Bishop Magnet School of the Arts is to create a supportive culture that nurtures the  greatest level of student achievement, by understanding and promoting the value of effective effort. To further this  mission, students will be involved in learning cycles, which require them to engage, explore, explain, evaluate and  elaborate upon their thinking. As a school community, we believe in educating the heart and mind. We believe that  hard work leads to student achievement. We also believe in the value and use of creative processes and that  character counts.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9                  2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 160Q was built in 1939. We are a Title I school located in a high poverty area in South Jamaica, Queens. It is a  community of private homes, many of which have been altered to house several families. PS 160Q has 29 classes,  servicing children in grades Pre-K to 5. Of the 29 classes, 6 are Integrated Co-Teaching classes in Kindergarten-5th  grade, and 6 self contained classes (12-1-1) in grades Kindergarten-5th grade. There are two sets of portable  classrooms in the schoolyard housing a total of eight classrooms, of which two are full day pre-kindergarten classes  with the additional space used as an indoor play area or movement room. Two of pre-kindergarten classes are housed  in the main building. The remaining set of portable classrooms are used for adult education classes.   At PS 160Q all grades devote 120 minutes to Literacy. Professional development is provided by administration,  Instructional Specialists and Content-Area Lead Teachers. Teachers also receive on-going professional learning by  attending Showcase School learning sessions as well as Field Support Center pd sessions. All grades devote 60 minutes  per day to math instruction. Assessment and pacing calendars are developed in conjunction with the Math vertical  team. This year, we will implement the Amplify Science program in K-5, as we begin to unpack the Next Generation  Science Standards.    Teachers will continue to use common preparation periods to plan lessons that will enable students to make their  thinking visible. As a team, they will review student work, refine unit plans and incorporate change strategies based  on areas of growth. Academic Intervention Services are conducted daily and students are provided with additional  intervention services during after-school.     We created a learning community that was focused on student outcomes with a vision to continue to accelerate  learning. Our teachers were able to demonstrate their level of commitment by using the results of informal  assessments, performance based assessments, writing on demand and math performance tasks to develop goals for  groups of students. With these goals in mind, teachers were able to provide students with actionable feedback that  they in turn used to improve their practice.   The areas in which our school has made the most growth during the previous school year has been implementing our  school's instructional focus of making thinking visible. As a school community the use of Thinking Maps as a common  language resulted in improvements in the transference of learning across multiple subject area . Teachers  implemented a rigorous curriculum and crafted lessons aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. This school  year, we will continue with the Chancellor’s Algebra for All Initiative by continuing to departmentalize our 5th grade  and 4th grade as well. We will also be teaching literacy with the use of the Teacher's College Reading & Writing Units  of Study school-wide.      Our strength lies in Trust amongst parents, teachers and the Principal in the School Quality Guide. Our vision is shared  with parents and students through monthly newsletters, Class Dojo and parent-child workshops. Our school has had  several accomplishments, one of which is being accepted into the South Jamaica Reads program. This program will  allow us to bring in several programs such as Read Alliance, Reading Partners, Springboard Summer Program, Queens  Public Library and Literacy Inc. These programs are geared toward academics as well as parent engagement. We are  also proud to be recognized as a Change for Kids Partner School. Through this collaboration, we are able to provide  students with a Story Pirates residency, a Children’s Museum of the Arts residency, a residency with Learning  Gardens, field trips and volunteers during our monthly Family Night events.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      A challenge that is prevalent within our school is around the issue of attendance. Our attendance rate of 92% is below  the city average of 94% and we are trying to rectify that situation. We have put various programs in place during the  school day to get students excited about coming to school. We will continue to address this issue during attendance  team meetings, celebrations during assembly programs and throughout all parent communications. Another  challenge that we have been faced with is educating bilingual students in a mono-lingual setting. We have had an  increase in students arriving from other countries, speaking little to no English and we are trying to find the most  effective way to provide them with a valuable and equitable education.       This year we will continue to build teachers capacity to progress monitor the goals written in the Individualized  Education Plans as well as incorporate Specially Designed Instruction within their lesson plans. With this practice in  place, rigorous instruction will be provided and goals will be monitored to ensure equity and excellence for all.       One of our primary goals for this year is for students to show measurable growth in their ability to read closely and  find meaning in complex texts. Teachers will explicitly model strategies for close reading and ask open-ended  questions to further deepen students understanding. An additional goal remains that students will show measurable  growth in their ability to solve complex word problems. Teachers will enable students to continue to make their  thinking visible in mathematics by utilizing our problem solving paradigm, CUBESSS and Math Exemplars. Success will  be measured by student performance on the New York State English Language Arts and Mathematics exams in grades  3-5 and the NYC Performance Assessments in grades K-2.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our SWD's continue to struggle with reading grade appropriate texts. Some of the standards that were noted to areas  of struggles dealt with vocabulary and inferencing. On the NYS exams, it was found that students had difficulty  determining word meaning of academic and domain specific words within informational texts. We also found that in  math students struggled with NBT standards in the area of multiplication which led to correlations found in the  Operations and Algebraic standards when asked to solve multi-step word problems.    Our ENL population is also growing. we have seen an influx of students in our upper elementary grades, that speak  little to no English at all. We have been faced with the challenge of educating bilingual students in a mono-lingual  setting. As these students are placed in grade where the literacy instruction is focused on reading to learn, we are  tasked with first getting them to learn how to read.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   An area where we have made the most progress over this past year has been in the element of Strong Family- Community Ties. On the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, there was an increase of 0.69 points which was 0.01 points  lower than the citywide average. 100% of the teachers agreed or strongly agreed that their professional development  experiences this year were sustained and coherently focused. 93% of the parents agreed or strongly agreed that  school staff regularly communicated with them about how families can help their child learn.    A key area of focus over the course of this school year will be Collaborative Teachers. This year there was a 0.12 point  decrease within this framework element.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

During the Principal's Performance Observation it was noted that the there was evidence of a coherent system for  teacher practice around learning targets and language objectives as well as student conferences. Teacher practice in  the areas of high level tasks, scaffolds, delivery of instruction and student discussion were inconsistent. We would like  to continue to see an improvement in this area by focusing on student’s ability to read closely and think critically  when answering text dependent questions in order to synthesize the text. A review of the Spring 2018 State  Standardized Assessments indicated that in English Language Arts there was an increase of 4%. However, we noticed  that student reading levels were stagnant and they struggled to read complex texts above their level. On the state  wide assessments in ELA (Grades 3-5), 32% of the students scored a Level 3 or 4. The key area of focus for this year is  will be to decrease the amount of students that scored a level 1 and move our level 2's to 3's.   As a result, our Instructional Focus is Making Critical Thinking Visible .      All Walter Francis Bishop Magnet School of the Arts students will show measurable growth in their ability to   read and understand complex texts. Students will continue to make their thinking visible in order to help  them strengthen their ability to cite evidence, and draw multiple conclusions as a result of explicit instruction  and open-ended questioning.   In order to support our instructional focus, teaching plans and learning activities need to be differentiated and match  instructional outcomes. Through Data Days, teachers will meet to analyze data and create appropriate plans to meet  the needs of their students through differentiated instruction.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.      By June 2019, students in Grade 3-5 will make their thinking visible by citing evidence and drawing conclusions  as they determine the theme and make inference within texts, thereby resulting in improved student outcomes  in reading as measured by a 10% increase in the number of students scoring a level 3 or higher on the NYS ELA  Mini Assessments.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Students scoring at level 1 Trait 1 - Reading and Answering text  dependent questions will receive small group instruction twice a  week to address student targeted skills.      Teachers will work with the IEP Teacher and ELL Teacher to plan  for differentiated, rigorous instruction in reading and writing.    Teacher teams will analyze student data to determine how  students learn best, specifically Students with Disabilities (SWD)  and English Language Learners in order to modify lessons to  include the use of Thinking Maps, annotations keys and modeling  thinking strategies.   Teachers will provide workshops for parents around close  reading and citing text evidence.     Quarterly newsletters will be sent to parents highlighting reading  and writing strategies.     Parents will participate in our Coffee and Conversation sessions  as well as at Parent Teacher Association meetings where the  Common Core Learning Standards will be addressed.    Teachers will use the data collected during the TC Reading  Assessments, Running Records and Close Reading Responses to  provide actionable feedback to students.     Administrators will meet with teachers during monthly data  meetings to discuss trends and design close reading lessons and  performance tasks.     Results from all assessments will be shared with staff in the  “Dose of Data” assessment newsletter.

During the 2017-2018 Principal Performance Review it was noted that the school was rated "Well Developed" in  maintaining a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the academic and personal growth of  students and adults. The learning environment showed an excellent rapport between teachers and students, with  structures in place to foster positive attitudes and opportunities regarding the personal growth of students. Students  are given voice through the various clubs and programs, and they are known by more than one adult.    Despite having created this supportive environment, attendance continues to be an issue. We ended the year with an  attendance rate of 90.2 which is below the city average. We will need to strengthen our attendance team and develop  new initiatives to address this ongoing problem.

High quality instruction is the strongest influence on student achievement. According to the 2017-2018 Principal's  Performance Observation an area of focus was found in Indicator 1.2 - Develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set  of beliefs about how students learn best.    It was also noted that there was evidence of a coherent system for teacher practice around learning targets and  language objectives as well as student conferences. Teacher practice in the areas of high level tasks, scaffolds,  delivery of instruction and student discussion were inconsistent. A suggestion was to consider the strategic use of  rubrics as a way for students to take ownership of their learning and monitor their own progress as we the impact and  growth of student learning was minimal.   According to the results from the 2017-2018 NYS Mathematics exams, the number of students reaching proficiency  increased by ___%. They key area of focus this year is to enhance students methods for annotating math word  problems. We would like to decrease the amount of students that scored a level 1 and move our 2's to 3's. The  instructional focus is Making Thinking Visible Across Content Areas. During math, students will be provided with  strategies to break down a word problem and annotate it to determine not only what was being asked, but to develop  a plan to solve it and make connections to past learning.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, 90% of teachers and teacher teams will work collaboratively to analyze student work when  solving multi-step word problems to make informed decisions about instruction, so that all students in grades K- 5 will improve a minimum of one performance level in the area of Representation as measured by the Math  Exemplar Performance Rubric.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          20     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed  to impact change.

Teachers will modify performance tasks to monitor student  progress in the NBT and OA standards.     Teachers will analyze data to identify students’ methods of  learning and plan for differentiated instruction and rigorous  tasks.    Teachers have common preps and professional learning cycles  to collaboratively plan, develop a deeper knowledge of  curriculum and differentiate instruction.   Teachers will analyze student data to determine how students  learn best, specifically Students with Disabilities and English  Language Learners in order to modify lessons to include  scaffolding using multiple means of representation, expression,  and engagement.        Teachers will develop and present parent workshops  highlighting strategies to help parents support their children's  learning. Workshops will also target the mathematical practices  and shifts in Common Core as well.  Monthly newsletters will be sent to our parents highlighting  problem solving strategies.     Parents will participate in our Coffee and Conversation sessions  as well as at Parent Teacher Association meetings where they  will learn how to support mathematics fluency at home.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   During the PPO, it was noted that the long term goals were derived from various assessment findings and were clearly  set to drive instruction. These goals were aligned to the action plans with clear expectations. Short term goals where  assessments were administered were used to monitor and track student progress. Moving forward, we need to  ensure that our goals are connected to classrooms' expectations and that it is evident in the teachers' practices.    Additional findings in the PPO, highlighted the fact that there was a cycle of assessment practice taking place school  wide and that teachers gathered0 the student data accordingly. However, school wide data monitoring is inconsistent  across subject areas. Monitoring of student progress for groups of students such as ELLs, or SWDs needed to be more  strategic and purposeful.It was suggested that a system for school wide data monitoring be consistently implemented  to gauge student progress throughout the school. This would allow for the development of plans of action on a wider  scale in order to improve student achievement, particularly for your level 1 and 2 students, ELLs and SWD students.      On the 2017-18 School Quality Snapshot 76% of the teachers felt that they were eager to try new ideas. 92% of the  teachers stated that they were actively trying to improve their teaching. To continue to build on this trend, it was  decided that the school would continue the implementation of Thinking Maps as a way to address all learners and  differentiate instruction. The use of Thinking Maps also aligns to our Instructional Focus of Making Thinking Visible  Across Content Areas.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, school leaders will provide targeted professional learning to all teachers around the use of data driven  instruction and progress monitoring resulting in a 10% decrease of teachers receiving a Developing rating in Domain 3 of  the Danielson Framework for Teaching.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          24     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed  to impact change.

Parent Involvement in the school has often times been low with an average of 20 parents at various events. We found  that many parents came out to see their children perform in a show or during a parent child workshop. We have  continued to conduct monthly family nights where parents and children can engage in activities together. Attendance  during these events average 80-100 parents.   Based on our school survey, about 70% of our parents agree that the school has invited them in to volunteer time to  support the school, which is a 7% increase from last year.   This year an area of celebration was the school wide use of Class Dojo. We were able to connect with 554 parents and  65 teachers were connected as well. Survey results revealed that 97% of families felt that the school communicates  with them in a language and in a way that they can understand. 93% of families felt that the school staff regularly  communicated with them about how families can help their child learn.    Parents receive a monthly newsletter that informs them about what units are going to be taught, a Parent Handbook  that lists all of the school’s policies, a copy of the chancellor’s policies regarding student attendance, as well as a  monthly calendar that lists the various meetings, extended day and after-school times, assembly programs and parent  workshops.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  All students receive teaching from 100% Highly Qualified Teachers according to the BEDS survey. Teachers receive  professional development in all content areas, on the CCLS, during Common Preps, Chancellor’s Conference Days,  with Queens South Borough Field Support Center Staff, Magnet Resource Specialists as well as our Program partners .  When a vacancy becomes available, there is a hiring committee that meets with the principal to go over resumes,  interview candidates, and observe demonstration lessons before hiring. The hiring committee then selects highly  qualified staff members. In order to retain highly qualified teachers, support and professional development are given  from our Administrative team, Magnet Resource Specialists and Program Partners. New teachers are mentored by  their mentor during their first year. When teachers switch grades they are mentored by a colleague on their grade for  an additional year. Teachers meet in teams during common preps and during their professional responsibilities time.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Differentiated professional development opportunities are offered to all staff members, including principals and  assistant principals, teachers, paraprofessionals and other staff members. This year our staff participated in Project  Based Learning, Elementary is Engineering, Lego, Queens Historical Society, Queens Museum, the 5E’s Learning Cycle,  Network facilitated Response to Intervention, Special Education, behavior management and ELL workshops. All  trainings are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and support teachers to implement the instructional  shifts required for student success in ELA and Math. The Principal and Assistant Principals have received training from  our Talent Coach, in aligning our ratings on teacher practice as assessed on Danielson"s Framework for Teaching.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  Families are invited to Kindergarten Orientation where they are introduced to administration and staff members who  will offer their services throughout the school year to their children. Part of the orientation schedule includes a visit  with one of the Kindergarten classrooms. General school information is distributed to parents/guardians (available in  English and Spanish). Information includes contact information, pre-school preparation activities, Common Core  Learning Standards, monthly calendar and a sample of the monthly Kindergarten newsletter.   During the registration process, incoming families complete Home Language Identification surveys and Program  Selection form for ELL’s to determine their needs i.e. oral and written language preferences, special education needs  and requirements. English Language Learners also meet with an ELL staff member for evaluation.  Families are encouraged to come to monthly meetings such as PTA meetings and Coffee and Conversation – both  offer a parent-child activity to help communicate to our families the academic and social expectations for their  children and how they might support this process at home. Parents are also encouraged to sign up for Pupil Path to  receive current information about their child’s academic progress.       4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teacher teams meet to discuss instruction and the assessments associated with them to measure student growth.  Grade Level (horizontal) and Inquiry Teams meet monthly to review data gathered from these assessments. The MoSL  Team will select the Measures of Student Learning for the 2017/2018 school year. Differentiated Professional  development is aligned to the findings of the data and offered during Professional Development Days. The  instructional cabinet/administrative team meets weekly to review student progress, review the findings from informal  and formal observations and adjust future professional development.     Teachers on the professional development committee meet to discuss trends seen amongst the grades. Once these  trends are identified we look at the assessment tools used to gather that data. Each team member discusses the  strengths and weaknesses of each tool. Together the team determines the next steps for the school.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 160Q , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the  school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   PS 160Q will support parents and families of Title I students by:            ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement  level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;  ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning  and decision making in support of the education of their children;  ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support  and monitor their child’s progress;  ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format,  and in languages that parents can understand;  ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to  improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between  parents and other members of the school community;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of  the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School  Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their  members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the  school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the  implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are  allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting  skills;  ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and  strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team,  the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes  providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership  skills;   ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report,  Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;  ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise  parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their  right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section  1118 and other applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act;  ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of  the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations  and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;  ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the  school year;  ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent- Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;  ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;  ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;  ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of  their children’s progress;  ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed  about school activities and student progress;  ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a  format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.   School-Parent Compact (SPC)                PS 160Q , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act,  is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded  by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share  responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be  developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?   To assess the early literacy skills of English Language Learners, P.S. 160 uses TCRWP to assess the literacy skills of our ELLs as  well as teacher observations and informal assessments.  Running records are used to record the child’s oral reading skills.  Running records consist of a set of conventions to provide data that will allow the teacher to evaluate the child’s decoding  skills, reading accuracy, comprehension and fluency.  Other informal assessments include, but not limited to: letter-sound  awareness inventory, conference notes and teacher made assessments based on individual student needs.    The data from the assessments are analyzed and used to provide insights about the reading abilities of our ELLs. This is  important so that interventions can then be put into place for our ELLs.  Based on the data and assessments given, the ELL  program includes phonics instruction(letter/sound connection) to improve the reading fluency of ELLs.  Thinking maps are  integrated into lessons for all grades in order to improve students’ organization of writing.  Instructional plans as well as  reading goals are based on the individual needs of our ELL students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?      Reading conferences conducted by the classroom teacher as well as the TCRWP Assessments provide the teacher with  valuable information on the reading skills of the ELL as well as their individual abilities.  Through teacher collaboration,  differentiated instruction and multiple entry points across all modalities will be implemented based on the needs of our ELL  population.  This data will also help to create an instructional plan that best meets the individual needs of our ELLs. Varying reading  strategies including read alouds, shared reading and guided reading will be incorporated into daily instruction.  The results  from running records indicate that some of our English Language Learners have not met the benchmarks in reading.  Vocabulary development will continue to be a focus to assist ELLs with language acquisition.   Targeted instruction is needed in  the areas of phonics, higher order thinking, inferential and literal reflection of texts as well as text to self-connections.          3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Observations, informal assessments, research-based assessments, along with program assessments such as those attached  with the Wilson Program help to evaluate success of the current program for ELLs. This also includes TC running records, NYS  exams as well as the NYSESLAT and grade specific Mosl's.  ELL students are expected to meet their annual goals and their  progress is monitored throughout the school year.  Data reveals that our ELLS are advancing proficiency levels on the  NYSESLAT exam.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once summative data has been collected, the ENL Vertical Team meet to analyze results to measure student learning,  From  the summative data, we can determine the effectiveness of our ENL program, such as: if the curriculum is aligned as well as if  the interventions being used are successful thus far.  The data will also provide us with valuable information to guide our  curriculum interventions and improve our instructional practices for our ELLs.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   For English Language Learners who score below specified levels of performance on their annual English language proficiency  assessment,  the determination will be made on whether or not they are in need of additional support services.   Data  collected for English Language Learners within the Response to Intervention framework is used to serve ELL’s who are at-risk  for academic difficulties.  It is used for prevention and early intervention based on a tiered system of instructional  support.  Data revealed indicates differentiated instruction is needed to meet the diverse needs of our students.  Instruction  for ELLS is also based on their language needs as well as understanding the language learning process of ELL’s.  Within the RTI  framework, information is being gathered through formal and informal assessments.  The data from these assessments are  being interpreted and read in a non discriminatory way.   Additional data is obtained from service providers as well as  classroom teachers.  Collaboration between providers and teachers is critical.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].     Outcome Assessments such as NYSITELL and NYSESLAT, English Language Arts and Math State Exams, standardized tests and  Mosl's are used to evaluate the success and needs in order to move ELL students.  Data patterns across all proficiency levels reveal that listening and speaking are the stronger modalities.  Students are more  deficient in the reading and writing modalities.   Data revealed from the NYSITELL indicates that students' English language proficiency skills are limited as scores were low in  listening and speaking.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         The ENL Vertical Team disseminates information from assessments, analyzes results in order to adjust curriculum and provide  additional strategies and supports necessary to meet student needs.  The data collected will be used to determine reading  groups within the classroom and inform instruction.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   P.S. 160 implements a Freestanding English as a New Language Program.  The program focuses on providing  instruction in English while providing home language support to emphasize English language acquisition.    The two types of ENL program are Stand- alone ENL  instruction as well as an Integrated ENL instruction.   Stand-alone  ENL instruction is to help ELL students develop English language skills in order to succeed in their core  content subject areas.  Integrated ENL instruction is provided to the  ELL student in order to help build their English  language skills through content area instruction. ELL students receive core content area instruction as well as English  language development instruction. Integrated ENL classes are taught by a teacher who is dually certified in the  content area and ENL or are co-taught by a certified content area teacher and a certified ENL teacher. Content area  instruction is taught using various ENL strategies.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Instructional minutes are provided according to the proficiency levels for ELLs based on their results from the NYSITELL  and NYSESLAT.  Beginner/ Entering students  and Low Intermediate/ Emerging students receive 360 minutes a  week.   Intermediate/Transitioning students and Advanced/ Expanding students receive 180 minutes a week.  Students who  are Proficent/Commanding receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL or ELA.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      For each program model,  content area instruction is delivered to build English language skills while using different ENL  strategies.  The focus of our ELL program is to enhance student understanding of English while at the same time learning  classroom content.  Content areas and thematic units are delivered throughout each program model.  Language is not taught  in isolation , but rather within the content areas. This allows for ELLS to be supported through both language development and  support for content instruction in their native language.  To meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards  students are presented with cognitive academic language within language and literacy instruction.  Visual aides including  pictures, picture books and usage of technology including Promethean board lessons are crucial in supplying  scaffolded  instruction for multiple entry points.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50          ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language throughout the school year.  New York State Tests in Math and  Science are available in translated versions for ELLs.  ELL students are given the Spanish LAB  to determine language  dominance. There are  bilingual teachers and paraprofessionals who are able to provide translation when necessary.  Reading  of texts are done in English to assess reading levels,  but the comprehension questions may be given in the child's native  language.  This would be done  to ensure that the child comprehends the text they are reading and assures student maximum  performance.  ELLs are able to use content specific glossaries.  Classroom teachers work with the ENL teacher to ensure that  information from assessments are consistent with the student's knowledge of content area..      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     SIFE students are students who have experienced interruption in their formal education.  These students will be informally  assessed once they return to a New York City Public School.  SIFE students are provided with extra support from math and  reading teachers.  In addition, the ENL teacher will meet with the child's classroom teacher to provide any additional support  and help that is needed.  These students are also being given the opportunity to attend before and after school  programs.  Sentence frames are provided as well as visual representations of words and stories to assist in differentiating for  SIFE and newcomer students.  Test taking strategies are emphasized for newly enrolled ELLS in preparation for the English Language Arts and Math State  Exams.  Students are given sample questions as well as practice tests.  This helps students learn the format of the test as well  as how to bubble in their answers.  Newly Enrolled ELLS are encouraged to attend after school programs where reading  strategies are the focus.  Skills addressed include listening and speaking  as well as reading skills such as how to make  inferences and how to make predictions. etc.. Newcomers will receive instruction that is simplified for them through different  ENL methodologies such as Total Physical Response (TPR) and modeling.  For ELLS receiving service for four to six years their  NYSESLAT scores help to determine their area of need.  They are given support through ENL methodologies.  Long-term ELL students will receive continued transitional support. For these students, there will be emphasis on academic  vocabulary in both spoken and written form through language enrichment.  Long-term ELL students receive instruction  focused on reading comprehension and writing. Students who reached proficiency on the NYSESLAT, continue to receive  support from their classroom teacher.  This is done as part of the extended day program or small group tutoring during the  professional prep period.   ELL students who were tested and are classified as Commanding are still given additional time for standardized testing for two  more years.  These students also receive 90 minutes of instruction a week.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    Instructional strategies used provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development.  They  include academic language and vocabulary development that is aligned to grade level writing and reading demands,  differentiation and scaffolds to help ELLS meet standards,  provisions of native language supports as well as integrate  technology.  Students are given support individually and in small groups.  The ENL teacher meets with the classroom teacher to  discuss student data and classroom observations.  Scaffolding strategies are implemented during instruction to assist in making  content understandable in order to accelerate English Language Development.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL students with disabilities are accountable for their goals that are standard based.  Their IEP's reflect New York State  Learning Standards and their educational outcomes for the long term.  P.S. 160 has curricular, instructional and scheduling  flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL's with disabilities.  Service providers including: Speech, Resource Room, ENL,  physical therapy and occupational therapy meet with the classroom teacher to make sure students meet their IEP goals and  expectations.  Scheduling of their services is done collaboratively to ensure that ELL-SWDs receive their mandated services   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      while being in the least restrictive environment.  Scheduling is flexible and is subject to change based on the student  needs.  Schedules of providers are checked with each other as well as the classroom teacher.  Careful records are kept and  maintained throughout the year by service providers, classroom teachers and administration.  This is achieved through  observations, assessments, SESIS and notes.  This is done to ensure ELL-SWD's mandated services are consistent so each  student can meet their ENL and IEP goals while meeting and /or exceeding their curriculum expectations.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   Interventions for ELLS are during independent reading time,  (At Risk) services and an after school program.  ELL students who  are identified as at risk, are provided with individualized and small group instruction in content areas as needed, in order to  strengthen the knowledge of content related materials for these ELLS.  Services also focus on explicitly teaching academic  language across all content areas.   When possible, the native language of ELLS is used to clarify and reinforce key concepts in  content area instruction.    Targeted intervention programs for ELLS in English Language Arts and Math are for ELLS in need of these services.  For ELLS in  need of testing support, we make sure they attend an After School Program.  The After School Program will focus on different  ENL strategies, content area instruction and math methodologies.   ELLS who have reached proficiency on the NYSESLAT,  are given continued support in their classroom.  Some of these students  are paired with newcomer ELLS who share the same language. Classroom teachers are made aware of these ELLS and so they  can be grouped accordingly for classroom lessons and projects. We offer continued transitional support for ELL students who  have reached proficiency on the NYSESLAT.  These students are given extra time on the New York State Math and New York  State English Language Arts Tests for the next two years.    These students are also provided with extra help in reading and  math as needed.  Proficient ELL students are invited to extended day in the morning as well as any after school programs  offered.   Close collaboration between the ENL teacher and classroom teacher is crucial and ongoing.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       For the upcoming school year we will offer interventions through Wilson Reading, Fundations and Just Words.  We will also be  using Imagine Learning to support English language learners with tools, resources, and research-based strategies.  The  program is designed to achieve success with social and academic English.  The four modalities of reading, listening, speaking,  and writing resources are organized in content area topics.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?    We do not plan on discontinuing any programs that we have in place for our ELLs.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELL's are afforded access to all school programs including intervention services and after school activities.   After school  services are to be determined based on deficits established during on-going review of the ENL program.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Teachers use a variety of realia, print, technology and visual media.  Modifications are made based on individual student  needs. Scaffolding is used for content areas and academic language to support ELL students.  The Balanced Literacy Program  follows the workshop model of Teachers College. It is used as well as guided reading for differentiated instruction.      Every classroom is equipped with laptops with internet connection.  As part of differentiation, teachers are using computers  as part of their program and curriculum. Classrooms are equipped with Promethium boards as well as ELMO visual projectors.    This technology gives ELLS additional support with visual aids.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?    In order to assure for communication,  students’ native languages are taken into consideration.  Students are provided with  bilingual books, bilingual dictionaries as well as audio books.   Translation services are available if needed.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Every effort is made so that ELL students are given resources to support their age and grade level such as leveled trade books  that support their interests as well as ability. All ELL materials used within our ELL program are age and grade appropriate to  support our ELLs in meeting Common Core Learning standards.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Registration generally occurs while schools is already in session, so there is not currently a program offered prior to the start of  school.  Activities that assist our newly enrolled ELLs  include monthly assemblies, musical productions and STEAM. The school  staff involved in these activities include our parent coordinator, The PTA as well as the music and classroom teachers.  New Ells  are paired up with another student who share the same home language to ensure a smooth  transition into the classroom.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?     N/A      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   There will be ongoing professional development for the staff in order to meet the needs of ELL students. The ENL teacher  attends workshops throughout the school year.  In addition, the parent coordinator attends different workshops to provide  parents with the necessary information on services for their children.  The literacy coach will provide professional  development to support staff and teachers.  The professional development will include understanding and the use of  instructional strategies in order to meet the needs of ELL students.  The ENL teacher will facilitate workshops to assist the  classroom teachers in incorporating ELL strategies in their classrooms.   These workshops are offered throughout the school  year to meet the needs of each ELL student.    The literacy coach, along with the ENL teacher have professional development workshops as well as monthly liason meetings  throughout the school year.  These workshops include testing procedures, promotional criteria and testing modifications for  ELL students.  ENL methodologies and scaffolding strategies are also demonstrated for all staff members.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53           The guidance counselor coordinates articulation meetings for parents and ELL students so parents and students are able to  address their concerns and questions before entering middle school.   Our ENL teacher is also involved in the TC Reading and  Writing Project and is adapting many of the reading and writing strategies for our ELL students.  We also have common  planning periods during which the classroom and ENL teacher meet in order to plan the best practices for our ELL students.       Professional Development is provided to all teachers in order to address the needs of our English Language Learners.    As per CR Part 154.2, there is a minimum of 15 percent of total hours for all teachers addressing language acquisition with a  focus on best practices for how to integrate language and content instruction as well as co-teaching strategies for our English  Language Learners.  For ENL teachers, 50 % of professional development focuses on integrating language and content  instruction and aligning language acquisition with core content area instruction.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Each year in September, parents are invited in to meet with the ENL teacher and parent coordinator for a parent  orientation.  Individual meetings with parents or guardians of ELLs are provided annually in order to discuss their child's  language development progress as well as the goals of the program .  A qualified interpreter or translator will be present if  needed.   This meeting is in addition to parent-teacher conferences and parent orientation. Teachers are given time weekly to  meet with and connect with parents.  This can be done through email, in-person meetings or phone calls.   Whichever is more  convenient for the parents is how communication is made.  This is where the goals, progress, if the child needs support,  assessments that have been taken or that are coming up as well as the development in language acquisition and content areas  are discussed.  The ENL teacher will keep a log to document when these meetings occur as well as the  information  discussed.  The meetings held with parents are to discuss and share their concerns for their children.  It is  important to work together in order to meet the needs of their individual child.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.    Upon identification of newly enrolled ELLs, parents are invited to attend a Parent Orientation meeting.  This is where where  they view a video in their native language  Parents are given information regarding city and state assessments, school  expectations as well as classroom requirements. Parent Orientation meetings are held at different times during the day to  accommodate working parents and meet their needs.  Additional orientation meetings are held throughout the school year  based on registration.. Teachers are given time weekly to connect with parents in person, through email, phone calls  or  letters.  Our bilingual parent coordinator has helped to create more parental involvement. She conducts a variety of  workshops that focus on test taking strategies, help with homework and ways parents can help increase their child's English  language development.    Parents attend a variety of workshops and assemblies throughout the school year as well.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.      Outreach is made to our ELL parents in order to ensure that their needs are being accommodated.  Annual individual meetings are  held with our ELL parents in addition to parent-teacher conferences and initial parent orientation meetings.  These individual  meetings are designed to address their child's language development as well as their language development needs in their content  areas.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54                     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Tiffany Hicks, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Walter Francis Bishop                                                                              School DBN: 28Q160  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      At registration, the ENL Teacher, assesses the home language of a student and issues the OTELE code on the HLIS  form. This data is then entered into ATS by the secretary. Our secretary downloads the RHLA and the RPOB  reports from ATS to identify the written translation and oral interpretation needs of our parents. This report is  given to our ENL teacher as well as our Parent Coordinator. This report is used for the distribution of any  materials, flyers and information to our parents. An informal survey is conducted by our Parent Coordinator with  the classroom teacher to collect any information on student languages and home language needs.The information  is updated as needed periodically throughout the school year.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    Spanish   Bengali   Urdu   Arabic           64   9   5   3   8.59   1.21   0.67   0.4   67   10   5   2   8.99   1.34   0.67   0.27      3.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      P.S. 160 will fulfill Section VII of Chancellor's Regulations A-663 regarding parental notification requirements for  translation and interpretation services in the following ways: important documents will be translated in a timely  manner, interpretation services will be provided, signs are posted indicating translation services are available and  information on the primary language of each non-English speaking household. There are translated versions of the  Parents Bill of Rights available in the main office. To ensure translation is available to parents, staff members and well  as parent volunteers will be available and present during registration, parent orientation workshops and meetings in  the school building with administration.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information.

Our bilingual parent coordinator is available to serve as a translator during  parent-teacher conferences as well as meetings throughout the school year. The Translation and Interpretation Unit  will be used as needed. In order to ensure a timely provision of translated documents to parents, translation request  forms are submitted well before the document is needed. This is if the Translation and Interpretation Unit is being  used. P.S. 160 also uses in-house school personnel to help translate needed documents.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Limited-English-proficient parents will be provided with a translation and interpretation survey in order to receive  feedback on translation and interpretation services. The results from the survey are used to improve the availability  and quality of services.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61
