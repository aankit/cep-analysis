This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      As a school-wide dual language program in its sixth year serving K-5th grade students, our goals are related to  supporting and developing students’ bilingualism and bi literacy, providing structures to support analytical thinking  and inquiry, ensuring a strong foundation in literacy and math, and working with families to establish positive and  trusting relationships that support productive school practices and strengthen student achievement.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Most of our students come from Spanish-speaking homes and are English Learners. Our most important initiative is to  connect inquiry-based learning with bilingual instruction to provide a rigorous context for language development and  analytical problem solving. Language learning and analytical problem solving are deeply related to the Common Core  Standards. Using a dual-language model allows us to build from students' home language as they learn a second  language.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   More than 75% of our students come from homes where a language other than English is spoken (mostly Spanish)  and more than 35% of our students are English Learners. Our initial Kindergarten students demonstrated that many  children lacked oral skills in their home language as well as their new language. While we have worked significantly to  support oral language development, it is an area we want to continue to improve.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Because we believe that developing the oral language development and analytical reasoning is fundamental to  developing all academic skills especially in the early grades, and math is an area that requires the ability to apply  concepts and is often less understood by elementary teachers, our instructional focus for this academic year is rooted  in math. Our math data from last year’s MOSL and 3rd grade State Assessments revealed developing proficiency in  student achievement. Upon analysis of these results, the coach, lead teacher, and principal decided that within  instruction we would prioritize inquiry work with all teachers around math development. Further, because “math  talk” is supported by numbers and often by quantity that can be expressed with objects, it is inherently scaffolded  when alternating between languages.      By focusing on developing a strong foundation in mathematical reasoning, number sense and fluency, reading and  writing foundations in math, and working with teachers to deepen their own practices to support discussion and  problem solving abilities in young children, our students will be equipped to further develop these skills as they  continue their education. Using inquiry within the curriculum provides the context for children to ask and answer  their own questions and both share and seek new information.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 06M103   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   351   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.           Dos Puentes believes in instruction that is customized, inclusive, and aligned to the Common Core. We believe in  bilingualism, biculturalism and biliteracy. Our students are learning to read in two languages and their reading  instruction must be targeted to build from one language to another. In the fall the teachers administer The Fountas  and Pinnell Reading Benchmark Assessment System in both languages. Each teacher analyzes the results of this  assessment and with the support of the administration and the Reading Specialist, they create individualized reading  goals for each student. The school’s assessments are compiled and entered in a schoolwide spreadsheet to monitor  progress and identify trends among the different subgroups. In February 2019, mid-point through the school year,  students will be re-assessed using Fountas and Pinnell. Teachers will analyze the progress of each student using data  from their running records. Teachers will create strategies for students to reach end-of-year goals. Targeted small  group instruction with our reading specialists and classroom teachers will focus on moving children toward mastering  their reading level goal. Creating individual goals is rigorous and inclusive for all of the students in our dual language  classrooms.   During the 2017-2018 Dos Puentes’ strengths and needs in literacy were:   Strengths:    Striving children and advanced children received targeted instruction in cycles with the Reading Specialist.     K-4th grade students receive targeted instruction by the reading teacher and an intervention teacher.    Teachers built foundational literacy skills with the help of the Teachers College coach.      Teachers led 10 parent workshops before, during, after school, and on selected Saturday mornings.    Teachers met every six weeks to look at reading progress and create next steps.     Schoolwide literacy was encouraged during “Reading March Madness” involving parents, teachers and  students.     Each of the three week-long vacations had a reading challenge. Students were reminded through a robo call   system throughout the week to read daily and fill out reading logs.   Needs:     Despite progress, we still have children reading below grade level.    More than 35% of our students are ELLs and the majority have remained in expanding for at least 2 years.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12           More than 23% of our students are students with disabilities and are reading below grade level.    Many of our teachers are new to the profession and are still developing literacy pedagogy     Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

While our QR rating for teacher pedagogy 1.2 was a Well Developed, we continue to consider the ways to adjust and  deepen our teaching to best support student progress. Analysis of teacher ratings through the Danielson Framework  reveals more work needs to be done in component 3C, Assessment in Instruction. By focusing on assessment we can  help children to understand what is being asked of them and how they can work towards their next steps for  progress. Making our goals more concrete through the use of rubrics and checklists will help to deconstruct the  various elements of an activity or assessment, making the learning expectation more transparent for the student and  support the teacher in his/her teaching. Focusing on assessment will also allow us to be more transparent with  families in the areas of strength and areas that need continued reinforcement. This will give families clearer ways to  help their child.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, we will move 20% of teachers from effective as of June 2018 to highly effective on Danielson 3D: Using  Assessment in Instruction.

We have university partnerships with Teachers College-Columbia University, City College of New York, and Bank  Street College that place student teachers in our building. These student teachers are getting their Master’s degrees  in Bilingual Education often with a Special Education extension. We recruit from these pool of candidates that we get  to know within the context of our school. We have a new teacher orientation in June to support teachers becoming  familiar with our community. The entire staff meets for a few days prior to the first week of school for a retreat to  deepen understanding and plan for our instruction priorities and learning focus. Each new teacher is given a mentor.  Lastly, new teachers work within a grade team to provide support for planning and assessment as well as staff  developers in reading, writing, and math.

High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Throughout the year teachers participate in in-school and out-of-school professional development through the  Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP), the Math Collaborative, and other Science and Language  Development opportunities. We are a Learning Partner School and work closely with the other schools in our  partnership to support teacher development through inter-school visits, instructional rounds, and individual school  inquiry around our learning focus. Para-professionals have participated in a district-wide weekly series on supporting  management, social and emotional development of children, and further literacy skills. Teachers, paraprofessionals,  student interns (BPS) and administration also worked in one of four Professional Learning Communities over a six- week period looking at enhancing literacy, guided reading, social and emotional practices, as well as differentiation.  All groups present findings and implications for the school. The principal also participates in a Principal Series at the  Teacher College Reading and Writing Project, study groups with other principals in our district as well as the principal  group of our Learning Partners Partnership. This last group focuses on oral language development for emerging  bilingual students.        Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

Prior to the application process, we have school tours so families can see what our school is like. In mid-June,  incoming Kindergarten children come to the school for an afternoon to participate in small groups with our current  Kindergarteners. In July, we have an incoming family BBQ for all the new families. In the late spring and summer, all  incoming children receive a home visit when two staff members visit students’ homes for about half an hour, bring a  Dos Puentes t-shirt, and answer any questions the family may have. Records of matriculating students are requested  from given preschools and pre-K programs. Students with existing IEPs are reviewed to ensure the appropriate  services are in place and appropriate class assignments are made for students needing an ICT classroom. As we grow  as a new school, we continue to develop partnerships with Pre-K programs to share K expectations and support  curriculum development in their programs to ensure children are prepared for the rigor of Kindergarten.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     There is a leadership committee comprised of the two model teachers, the coach, reading specialist, and grade  leaders of which two are Special Education Teachers. They meet with the principal weekly to consider assessment  results and plan next steps. Additionally these results are shared in grade teams, with next steps as part of the  assessment process. After each writing and reading unit, we use a Schools A Tune protocol to look at students work as  a grade team.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32      each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33     State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)   Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Dos Puentes Elementary School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36            Dos Puentes Elementary School , will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   * providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   * providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input.       Parental Involvement and School Quality  To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      hold an annual Title 1 Parent Curriculum Conference prior to Oct. 30 of each year outlining the given  allocation of funds and how they will be spent as well as the activities planned for family engagement  throughout the year. The Title 1 Representative will work closely with the Parent Coordinator to organize and  publicize this event.

Further many of our young children have limited  opportunities to develop academic language. With these concerns in mind we have developed  three programs to support further linguistic and academic development for all of our  Kindergarten through Fourth Grade ENL students.     The first program will be an after-school, small group institute:  Rationale:  This program will be created to support ENLs and EP from our DL program who are  struggling in literacy skills.  In grades K-2 we will target entering through transitional levels.  Subgroups & grade levels of students to be served:  5 groups of 4-6 students, grades K-2.  Schedule and duration:  2 afternoons per week (Thurs, & Friday); February 23 through April 8  (12 sessions) for 1 hour a session.  Language of instruction: Three groups will use ENL strategies and be taught in English. Two  groups will be taught in Spanish to support Native Language development.  # and types of certified teachers:  5 bilingual teachers;   Teachers will provide direct instruction to their particular group.  There will be no need for a supervisor as one will be on-site already for another program.  Types of materials:  leveled guided reading books in Spanish and English: RAZ kids on ipads in  Spanish  and English; Fountas and Pinnell Assessment kits. These materials are from the general  curriculum of the school (thus no purchase will be necessary).    The second program will be a Saturday Learning series:  Rationale:  This program will be designed to help students develop deeper oral language  proficiency in  Reading and/or Math as they work along side their family member to practice skills that can be  reinforced at home.  Subgroups & grade levels of students to be served:  2 groups of ENLs of 10 students with their  parents at the Entering to Transitioning level and 2 groups of EP students reading at F&P levels  lower than F in grades K-2  Schedule and duration:  2 Saturdays from February to April, 3 hours each session  Language of instruction:  Spanish and English, groups will be divided by families language of  dominance.  # and types of certified teachers:  4 bilingual teachers  Teachers will provide direct instruction to their particular group.  Types of materials:  Leveled libraries in Spanish and English; big books in Spanish and English,  teacher made materials for families to follow up with at home.     The third program will be a Saturday academy for our 3rd , 4th, and 5th grade ENL students:  Rationale:  Students will participate in activities to help develop academic vocabulary and  improve oral language proficiency  and reading, writing, and Math in English.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Subgroup & grade levels of students to be served:  6 groups of 3rd and 4th, and 5th  grade ENL  students of 8 students each, targeting our "expanding" level students who have not moved in two  years.  Teachers will provide direct instruction to their particular group.  Schedule and duration:  6 Saturdays from February to March, 2 hours each session  Language of instruction:  English  # and types of certified teachers:  8 bilingual teachers.  Types of materials:  Writing Materials in English from the TCRWP curriculum, articles to  support discussion from the Social Studies Third Grade and Fourth Grade Curriculum. For Math  we will use Engage NY curriculum. (These materials will not have to be purchased as we have  them in our building.     $1018 will be used for K-5, Spanish and English leveled books from Santillana to support each  of these 3 programs.

Teachers to receive training:  all bilingually certified teachers and teachers in the process of  being  bilingually certified (about 8 teachers)    Schedule and duration:  Nov.. 1-January 15; once a week, for 8 weeks, for 45 minutes.  Title III Funds will be used to pay for the books (about $200)  As we anticipate having at least 8 members in these sessions. Compensation for these session  will be the purchase of the book used in the study group (we will choose a book from the Young  Adult category in Spanish)  Topics to be covered: nuances/structures of Spanish literature; vocabulary development; high  level  conversations  Name of provider:  Rebeca Madrigal (4 hours per session to plan facilitation)     Professional development will also include preparation for the Direct Instructional Supplemental  Programs listed above.  Approximately 28 hours will be given to each of the teachers to  collaborate and prepare for each of the programs.  As we are a consolidated school with Title 1  funding, additional funds will come from the school budget to support any deficit in funding.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44           Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  As a school we use Fountas and Pinnell (F&P) to assess all our students in Spanish and English. Students are first tested in their  dominant language or English if they speak a language other than English or Spanish . This assessment is implemented at least  three times a year, and more often for students who are not at benchmark levels. We have similar practices to support  phonics including Estrellita and Palabaras a Paso as well as Fundations and Words Their Way for our 2-4th grade students.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Once children are assessed for their Fountas and Pinnell level in English and Spanish, teachers create guided reading groups  based on the reading data collected allowing them to meet with all their students 2-3 times a week. For children who are  significantly below the bench mark level, an intervention Specialist meets with children two to three times a week between   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48   assessment cycles to support progress. These intervention specialists include: our Reading Specialist, a Spanish intervention  teacher, a Bilingual SETTS teacher, or our Upper grade coach.  Students with IEPS are served by the SETTS teacher or the  Special Education Teacher in the ICT classrooms.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We use NYC performance Math tasks in the beginning of the year for Math assessment data as well as some inventory  assessments provided by the Math Collective. For Literacy we use the F and P System for assessments in both English and  Spanish baselines and progress monitoring throughout the year. Pre and post on demand writing assessments are  administered for each of the 5 Writing Units of the year.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once data is collected, a reading and math goal is created for each child for the year. These goals are created to ensure at least  a year's worth of growth. Through MOSL we use the Goal Setting Option, thus the goals are entered in the NYC Advance  system.  Classroom teachers monitor progress through sharing data during grade level meetings and to the academic team  that meets weekly. This team is comprised of the Reading Specialist, the 2 academic coaches, the ULT Coach, and the principal.  Children who are behind grade level goals are provided RTI intervention in 6-8 week cycles by the Spanish intervention  teacher,  Bilingual SETTS teacher as well as targeted support by the coaches.  Children are then progress monitored with  formative assessments to measure improvement every 4 to 6 weeks.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   We support our ELLs under the RTI structure; design research-based instruction that is linguistically and culturally appropriate  for ELLs; best use assessments to guide daily instruction (Tier1); and best design instructional routines and interventions in  Tiers 2 and 3. We ensure our Tier 1, Core Instruction, includes instruction that supports the needs of our ELLs by teaching the  language through the content. Teachers design lessons with language objectives throughout all content areas by ensuring  strong scaffolds for a variety of language levels access, As an example, teachers implicitly and explicitly teach vocabulary used  in content area studies, read alouds, and inquiry-based studies. Students have multiple exposures to new words and see those  words used in context.   Any student who is below the grade level benchmark for language arts after the first four weeks of school, is given reading  intervention in small groups with in the classroom. These groups work 2-3 days a week for a 6-8 week cycle. At the end of the  cycle students are reassessed and the groups are reformed according to students' needs. If progress is slow or not evident, the  child is given more frequent time in small groups with an emphasis on a particular strategy. If after more frequent small group  instruction, the child still has slow progress, they begin to work specifically with the Bilingual Reading Specialist by being pulled  from the classroom to work 2-3 times a week for 30 minutes a session. The reading intervention teacher works closely with the  classroom teacher to share information and collaborate on reinforcing particular skills.  While Spanish ELL students are served  in both Spanish and English, students who are ELLs who speak Russian or Korean are given intervention exclusively in English  with strong language development strategies in place as part of the intervention.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    English and Spanish Fountas and Pinnell levels, end of unit assessments in Math, Math performance tasks, NYSESLAT, and  ELA and Math State exams, as well as the ELE.  All students take these assessments including all students taking the ELE.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Sharing Data with the grade leaders from each grade team identify school wide trends. Then having the grade leaders share  this data at the grade level to consider grade level trends. Further members of of the Language Allocation Policy Team also  review this data with the Academic Planning team that meets weekly to determine goals and action plans for whole school  trends.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our ENL Program is specified for our Entering and Emerging Students and Students from Languages other than  Spanish and English who are part of our Dual Language program. Specifically we have one former Russian ELL and  one  Korean ELL student. These students are provided ENL services for their mandated minutes by the bilingually  certified teachers who at the elementary level can provide ENL services. These students are pulled into Small groups  for services within the English Classroom in our school wide dual language model.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Dos Puentes follows a Dual Language Program through a 50/50 alternating day model.  Therefore, ENL instruction is  provided during English instruction and instruction is differentiated based on student proficiency level and time  allotments as per CR Part 154.  All content and literacy instruction in English is delivered using ENL methodologies and  all instruction is differentiated to support the linguistic and literacy diversity in the classrooms. All K-4 students  receive literacy instruction and content instruction in the new language and the home language.  Classrooms are  comprised of heterogeneously mixed ELLs and Non-ELLs as peer language models are essential for the oral language  development of all students.  Within our ICT dual language classrooms, instruction occurs in self-contained classrooms  provided by two certified and highly qualified bilingual teachers. During ENL instruction, the bilingual teachers  provides targeted and differentiated ENL strategies and scaffolds for ELLs to ensure language progression.  Teachers  plan for content and language objectives (the latter reflecting differentiation based on level of language  proficiency and literacy data).           2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              We use the guidelines from CR Part 154 and we program class schedules and student schedules accordingly in STARS,  ensuring  that all mandated minutes are explicitly accounted for and that these are integrated within content area instruction  as well as English language skills. We have a literacy block of a minimum of 120 minutes, which is inclusive of all components  of balanced literacy.   Students in Dual Language Classrooms receive literacy instruction in both languages as Read Aloud, Shared Reading, Shared  Writing, and Interactive Writing occur in both languages on a daily basis (through the literacy component and through content  area instruction). In addition, ENL integrated instruction is included as part of the literacy block and the content area  instruction as teachers plan for content and language goals in all content areas.    ENL instruction and ELA instruction is provided during the 120 minutes literacy block and an additional block for ENL for  students who are in the Entering, Emerging and Transitioning stages. The students receive targeted instructional that builds  upon oral language development and English literacy skills through explicit teaching, addressing all four modalities.            3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         Teachers plan intentionally for content, literacy, and language objectives using:  literacy data (F&P Benchmark in either one  language or both languages); NYSITELL/NYSELSAT data; CCLS (inclusive of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, Reading  Foundational Standards, and Language Standards); our core curricula--TCRWP Units of Studies, Fundations, Estrellita, Inquiry  based units which integrate literacy and the NYCDOE Scope and Sequence for Science, NYCDOE Scope and Sequence for Social  Studies, Math Units of Studies aligned to CCLS; and knowledge of best literacy and ELL research based practices.      We use the Student Oral Language Observation Metric (SOLOM) to assess students social and academic oral production  especially in Math. We are currently aligning it to the NYSELSAT Speaking rubrics to assess for additional oral language  development. Teacher teams meet and analyze student transcripts and videos using these rubrics along with the above data  and resources to intentionally target language outcomes.      To support background knowledge and vocabulary, we use an inquiry-based approach to learning (thematic/interdisciplinary),  where students are immersed in hands-on experiences through trips, media, visual, and front-loading of vocabulary. In  cooperative group settings students use graphic organizers, such as concept maps and semantic maps, to support the oral  language development and academic language and writing. Technology is weaved into the curriculum as a means to  differentiate and support all learners in all four modalities. Sentence frames and starters (differentiated for various proficiency  levels) are provided to support students to engage in academic discourse. Explicit teaching of tier 2 words throughout the  school allows for the development of academic vocabulary for all students.             4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      We use the following assessments:           Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark in Spanish, Estrellita, Engage NY Math End of unit assessments in Spanish and English,  TCRWP Literacy Rubric to assess writing samples in Spanish, and teacher-created assessments. Lastly, we are using the SOLOM  with a NYSESLAT-revised speaking rubric to assess academic language in Spanish and English. Classrooms are suoplied with  English and Spanish libraries, word walls, content word walls, and other bilingual materials. Bilingual speakers are brought in to  share experiences with children in both English and Spanish. Field trips that provide experiences in either Spanish or English  are also provided.           5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    As a  K-4 school, Dos Puentes has very few SIFE students currently as only our current 3rd or 4th graders could qualify. This  past year we had one SIFE student in 3rd grade. We kept him in his age appropriate grade and provided one literacy pull out  support to support his Spanish literacy development. Within in the classroom, he also received individual ESL support from one  of the two bilingually certified teachers in the room daily.           For our Newcomers, who are potentially the majority of our students, we provide differentiated instruction as teachers  intentionally plan literacy, content, and language objectives with in all content areas. Entering, Emergent, and Transitioning  students are provided with daily explicit language instruction in heterogenous and homogenous grouping through shared  reading and inquiry based tasks that support the targeted linguistic need. This is in addition to the integrated ENL instruction.  Teachers differentiate by planning for language demands based on analysis of text complexity and student needs for all ELLs.  ELLs who are in the Advanced and Commanding Stages, are also provided with targeted integrated ENL instruction based on  literacy, and linguistic data, throughout the content areas and literacy block.          In addition, targeted language instruction is provided as part of our after-school Title 3 program, as students are immersed  in rigorous inquiry-based/science units of studies that focus on academic language development.           For students who are Developing ELLs, and students who are potential Developing ELLs, additional targeted instruction/  intervention is provided by a ENL or Bilingual Certified teacher as part of RTI for ELLs (Tier 2 services).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51              For former ELLs, we provide all supports needed as per their data and as per CR Part 154.2 mandated services. Since we  have a fully implemented dual-language program, former ELLs will continue to receive ENL services with their classroom  teachers.  Teachers use ESL strategies and scaffolds to ensure students have supports needed to access the CCLS aligned units  of study          Testing accommodations for ELLs and Former ELLs are as follows:  Students will received time-and-a-half on all  tests/assessments requiring time limits.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers continue to plan for language and literacy outcome for all students in order to provide differentiated instruction.  Through flexible grouping, multiple entry points, and Universal-by-Design planning, teachers ensure IEP goals are met.  Students continue to be immersed in TCRWP units of studies and mentor texts, as well as texts used in our inter-disciplinary  units of studies. Teachers include (add on) text sets of various levels to support the content understandings.           Targeted goals for students include language goals and language of instruction as needed, to ensure 2nd language and  literacy progression. Teachers use both grade leveled texts with appropriate scaffolds for comprehension and guided texts  based on their level of instruction, as per running records and F&P benchmark. In addition, teacher teams study and  implement strategies for intervention. All students are immersed in rigorous CCLS aligned instruction that is developmentally  and grade level appropriate. Texts are never "watered down", rather the scaffolds placed allow for students to access the  content.          ELL-SWD students are also supported through the use of Fundations phonics program, afterschool tutoring, our summer  school program for non-mandated students, and reading intervention during the school day. Our SETTS teacher also uses Max  Scholar to support additional phonics intervention through an Orton Gillian approach.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Of our 15 K-4 classrooms, 5 are ICT classrooms.  All classrooms follow a dual language, 50/50, English/Spanish  Model.  Therefore we offer our ELL-SWDs the least restrictive environment with highly qualified personnel in the DL ICT  classrooms, as these teacher teams are specialized in special education, bilingual education, and early childhood education or  common branch licences.  Our teacher teams provide small group and differentiated (targeted) instruction throughout the day  to ensure students meet their IEP goals. In addition, we have a support staff comprised of a reading specialist (who is  bilingually certified) who provides additional targeted intervention. Our bilingual SETSS teachers (2) provides mandated at-risk  services and ensures articulation with all teachers. We have 2 bilingual speech teachers in the building, who in addition to  serving their mandated students provide support with at-risk intervention services and "consults" as needed.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  We provide targeted instruction as per student needs. For students who are in the transitioning stage and above, and where  the literacy data reveals comprehension and phonics instructions needs to be strengthened, we use The Fountas & Pinnell  Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) as a small-group, supplementary literacy intervention as data demonstrates that LLI  is an effective short-term intervention for struggling readers who are also classified as English Language Learners. We also use  a double dose of FUNdations in English and a double dose of Estrellita in Spanish. In Math, teachers use End-of-Unit  assessments through Engage NY to identify and target specific skills/strands to focus in on and provide small group instruction  with progress monitoring.            9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      In addition to our bilingual reading specialist and bilingual SETTS teacher, we will add a second bilingual SETTS teacher and a  second bilingual speech teacher providing more intervention and support for struggling ELL students.   While we will continue to use Estrellita teaching strategies and curriculum, we will add Palabaras a su paseo for upper grade  Spanish word study and grammar.  We are currently in the pilot implementation of Palabara a su Paseo as we only recently  received the materials.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs are included in all school programs. They all are programmed to participate in the wonderful arts programs we offer  such as: Studio in a School; Music; and Afterschool Drama and Dance. The Arts teachers plan for linguistic and cultural  competencies, as questioning and discussion are intentionally planned for, as is awareness of various cultural traditions (which  are reflective of our families). Afterschool enrichment programs are available to all ELLs and include Dance, Chorus, Gardening,  Soccer, Cooking, Chess and extra support through Zankel Fellows (a program from Teachers College).      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Each of our units are thematically planned to incorporate hands on experiences, field trips, and connections to science and  social studies. Technology is used to provide visuals of the subject matter. Ipads are used for individual student research and  taking photos of the subject at hand. Google Chrome books are used starting in 3rd grade to conduct research and sharpen  technology skills. Because gardening is a big part of our science curriculum, having the students actually garden in front of our  school provides realia and actual experiences to support the understanding of the language and content.  Some specific  material for each subgroup is listed below:       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language is supported through the 50/50 Spanish English Dual language model followed throughout our school. Families  of our few students whose home language is neither English or Spanish, are invited biweekly to the classroom through a period  called Family Friday. At this time, these family members can work with the child in their home language and introduce the  language and culture of their home (Russian and Korean).      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Because the whole school follows a 50/50 dual language model, and all teachers hold a bilingual license, all content area  instruction and the majority of enrichment activities are available in each grade. Language planning for different levels of  acquisition are provided in all content areas.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Because both schools have extensive afterschool programs we coordinates space to ensure all children in the building have  access to outdoor space, the gym, auditorium, and cafeteria. For the past 3 years we have also shared a WELLNESS in the  School Partnership for healthy eating and exercise.   The ELL coordinators of each school share test resources and information  on compliance when need to ensure all assessments are administered effectively. PS 132 our co-located school has given us a  number or Spanish titles to support our upper level Spanish classrooms. We provide models for visits to PS 132 and have  recently shared our Kindergarten Spanish adaptations of the TCRWP English  materials.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly arrived students who are entering first or second grade, who register in June or in the summer, are invited to our  Summer institute, a four week half-day program for academic support in English and Spanish. Further we conduct home visits  for all our students (by two staff members) to provide direct information to the families, get to know the child, and create a  link to the school before they arrive. These visits are conducted in student's home language.         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53            18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We follow a 50/50 Spanish English Dual language program. Approximately 60% of our students are EP. Of  these about half are truly balanced bilinguals, and 50% are EP's who are learning Spanish. All K  classrooms, and all ICT classrooms are self contained. They alternate languages with Monday,  Wednesday, and Friday morning in Spanish and Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday afternoon in English. All  out-of-classroom classes follow this schedule (e.g. PE, art, music, etc.). The remaining two classes on each  grade follow a side-by-side model and alternate language daily. All content is taught in both languages,  always extending the previous day's lesson.          Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  As all staff are bilingually certified and serve students through a DL model, language planning is a centerpiece of our  Professional Development. Last year we had a whole staff inquiry group where we considered language development through  math and math talk. We read the book "Number Talks" as a staff, conducted intervisitations, and turn-keyed various outside  PDs that individual teachers attended. We continue to use the SOLOM assessment tool for language development. Each staff  member had one child (as a case study) to practice and implement this tool. We will continue with this assessment by  collaborating to create language interventions for these kids and correlating the rubric to the NYSESLAT rubric.     This year we are a Host School for the Learning Partners Partnership. Our cohort is made up of two schools that both of dual  language programs. Our Partnership focus is considering the transfer from Speaking to Writing. Each month we have  interschool visits that include observations of Ells of various levels through the lens of oral language transferred to written  language. There will be a total of 6 interschool visits and three collective meetings to review and refine our data as it relates to  our year long goals. Dos Puentes hopes to improve Math End of the year performance task scores by 7% for all our ELLs in 3rd  and 4th grade.     Additional professional development opportunities for Teachers and non-pedagogic staff include attending  Fordham University's language series, Speech Teachers attending ELL workshops by the Office of Speech, Dr. Ofelia Garcia  addressing our staff in December about Translanguageing, a partnership with Teachers College Bilingual Special Education  Program and training future bilingual teachers, our BPS interns attending monthly ELL training, and our secretary attending PD  opportunities offered by the office od English Language Learners.   Our bi-monthly Inquiry group considers linguistic development in Math as mentioned above. Our literacy planning is done on  each grade with experienced bilingual teacher leaders. Teachers attend sessions at Teachers College, through the ODELL series,  and work collaboratively with two other partners in our Learning Partner Network.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         Because our whole school is a dual language program, and all teachers are bilingually certified or ESL certified, most of our  Professional Development connects content and language development into all professional development  opportunities.  Language development strategies and ways to be culturally  inclusive to meet the various needs of our student  population are more than 80% of the activities in our annual Professional Development Plan.   Agendas, notes and sign in sheets are maintained for all grade level planning, professional development, and outside  conferences and workshops. As a dual language school, professional development always considers linguistic development as  well as academic development.    Given the above information we easily complete the CR Part 154 requirements for 15% of total areas for all teachers and 50%  of total hours for blingual/ ENL teachers to receive ELL-specific professional development.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   All parents of ELLs receive orientation about their program model during Curriculum Night. We ensure our parents understand  our goals, expectations, and services/supports for students for their language development throughout the disciplines.  Data  sources from NYSELSLAT, SOLOM with revisions based from NYSELSAT Rubric ,  F&P, Math Assessments, and other formative  assessments are interpreted and shared to demonstrate students' academic progress and students' language development  through Student Goal Sheets.  The dual language teams have Spanish-speaking teachers (which is a great portion of our  population). All new families also receive a home visit where language allocation is explained. We have parent workshops each  month in English and Spanish, to support families better understanding their children's progress and providing supports to be  used at home. Periodically, teachers meet with individual families targeting the ELL individually throughout the year during the  parent engagement Tuesdays to provide targeted support  and to discuss individual needs.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parent Engagement     We collaborate closely with our parents to create an environment of trust, respect, and mutual support. Therefore we have  on-going discussions and surveys with our families in order to create learning opportunities and meetings that foster student  academic achievement and well-being.      There will be workshops for Parents of English language learners regarding:   o     Supporting English Language Development through technology   o     Homework help in English   o     Developing the native language to support the second language   o     Resources in the community   o     The speech teachers will conduct a parent workshop for parents on developing oral language.     There will be workshops for Parents of students who are learning Spanish:   o     Supporting Spanish Language Development through technology   o     Homework help in Spanish   o     Spanish Language Basics  o     Resources in the community   o     The speech teachers will conduct a parent workshop for parents on developing oral language    Additionally we have Family Fridays twice a month when families can visit the classroom, first period, to see the happenings of  the school. These sessions are always conducted in Spanish in our self-contained classes and Spanish side-by-side rooms.  This  helps the Spanish families understand the content and context. The English families get to see the rigor of what is being   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         expected of their children and their children's successes in the new language.    Each classroom also has an English dominant class parent and a Spanish dominant class parent to communicate school events,  answer questions, and provide school information as needed. Class parents meet as a group monthly to support one and other  and work with the parent coordinator.       Further we have monthly events in the evenings for families to gather to get to know each other and feel a part of the  academic community. These events include a family potluck, Carnival, a Harvest Festival, Movie nights in Spanish and English,  Gardening Day, and our end of the year celebrations. All events are held in Spanish and English.         Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Victoria Hunt, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Dos Puentes Elementary                                                                              School DBN: 06M103  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      100 % of our students' families are given the home language survey when they enroll in our school. This is done by  a trained bilingual pedagogue, as all our staff is bilingually certified. All staff, apart from our music teacher, speak  both Spanish and English providing immediate oral translation for any direct contact with our, more than 70%,  Spanish speaking family population. We also look through ATS Report of Preferred Languages, Blue Card data,  Parent Surveys, Teacher Survey (collect data by class) to ensure we are reaching students and families in their  preferred language.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    English   Spanish   N/A   N/A           274   257   N/A   N/A   51.6   48.4   N/A   N/A   273   258   N/A   N/A   51.41   48.59   N/A   N/A   3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.     N/A          Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      Document Name    Month/Frequency Distributed to   Families    All registration forms                           April - September, ongoing                       November 16,   Supplement to Stars Report Card and  Individual Student Goal Sheets   March 15,         June 28   How do you plan to translate? Include  procedures to ensure timely provision  of translated documents to parents.    We translate all documents that need  to be distributed to families in English  and Spanish. These include calendars,  handbook, newsletters, website, all  family notices, robo-calls, after-school  registration and notification, report  cards, testing dates, overview of  curriculum, and letters home from the  teachers, staff and principal. The  material is only translated to Spanish  since our families from the other  linguistic groups speak English as well  as read and write English. All families  will be informed upon registration that  translation services will be available  for access for all families. For low- incident languages not covered  through DOE language listed on our  RCPL, we will work with the DOE  translation service department to  ensure access for these families.  Additionally, our parent coordinator  will work with community and family  members to ensure language  translation is available for school  meetings, and to translate documents  to support information and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      communication with families of low- incident members.

Curriculum Night                                    Because all staff is bilingual, meetings  can be held in Spanish or English. Face  to face meetings happen at the  beginning of the registration process,  during initial home visits with new  families, at curriculum night, PA  meetings, principal chats, monthly  family events, scheduled parent  teacher conferences, additional ELL  family meetings, bi-monthly Family  Fridays, and daily at dismissal. A  monthly calendar goes to families in,  English and Spanish, of upcoming  events. We are also working on a  bilingual website.       We will work with the community and  the DOE office of translation services  to provide translation for low incident  languages spoken by our families.    PA Meetings   Following Family Fridays or second  Tuesday of the month. Dates have been  calendarized and sent to families.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      If it is an individual child, a member of the Office Personnel will call the family in their home language. In the event of  a school-wide emergency, Office personnel will send a robo-call in English and Spanish.   Students of low-incident languages will be contacted directly to ensure they are informed. We will build from the  language line through the DOE to support them.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      As a dual-language school with more than 90% of our staff fluent in English and Spanish (the languages of our  families), language access is discussed periodically in professional development and other staff trainings.      During Professional Development time on Tuesdays, we will address ensuring access as well as engagement with  various language groups. As the vast majority of families speak English and/or Spanish, we will work to support staff in  reaching these families in both languages but also target low incident languages to ensure access. This will be done by  informing our staff of the language translations features on Dojo, Remind, and through our school website.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      We will follow the implementation of all the items on the above checklist through fliers, communication with our  Parent Coordinator, Teachers and ELL Coordinator, PA meetings, and at parent workshops.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      At Principal monthly chats with parents, that are conducted in English and Spanish, we will illicit feedback as to their  needs and availability of translation services. All parent surveys are given out in either Spanish or English and we will  ensure that families of low incident languages are provided access to the Language Line so they can utilize these  translation services and complete the parent surveys orally.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63
