This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   We are growing and fostering a diverse community of young leaders and critical thinkers in a nurturing and  academically rich environment.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   03M165 serves the community from Pre-K to Grade 5. We grow all students by meeting them at their level and then  using rigorous, CCSS-aligned instruction to develop them to grade-level learning and beyond. We believe that  students learn by doing, and as a result of this belief, we have made student discussions, tiered activities, and hands- on engagement the instructional initiatives for the 2018-19 school year, all of which initiatives have produced  measurable growth in teacher practice. We also know that a student’s growth is not only in the classroom and not  only academic. We work with all students to become ready, responsible, and respectful leaders. We incorporate  multi-dimensional music, art, language, and technology curricula. We partner with community organizations to  extend student growth after school. We engage parents as collaborators in honing and expanding our vision and  mission. 03M165 has been a fixture in this community for more than a century. Our work will ensure that it remains a  fixture for centuries to come.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     - Strengths: Student work time, consistent lesson structure, differentiated instruction, CCLS-aligned curricula that is  engaging, partnerships with DOE Showcase staff, Number Talks, professional development that develops content  knowledge.      - Needs: In June 2018 we reached 65% Math proficiency as measured by the CGA.   Two years ago , data showed that the internal data (end of unit performance tasks) results did not correlate with the  proficiency results in the state tests. . In addition this year's baseline shows proficiency level at an approximate    Therefore, we decided to change our internal diagnostic from end of unit performance tasks to the Comprehensive  Growth Assessment to better assess the correlation between grade level standards and the New York State exam.  This new internal diagnostic will measure proficiency in a consistent manner and will be administered three times  during the year. By measuring proficiency on the common core standards for the grade we hope to identify the  growth and the areas of improvement in order to adjust teacher practice.       In conclusion, we will use a Comprehensive Growth Assessment and Exemplars to measure proficiency. We selected  70% proficiency as the target because that figure correlates with grade-level state test pass percentage. We designed  an assessment calendar that provides an opportunity for a beginning, midpoint, and end of year progress monitoring.      The data will be analyzed to create small groups for the guided math period, will be utilized to refine instruction.   - Data: CGI and Exemplars , MOTP ratings and learning walks will measure implementation of data analysis math  based student work.

The literacy coach will analyze reading levels and a whole  school data report will be generated.  Once a month grade level team meetings, grade level  teams will analyze their reading level and or state data and  give each other feedback and strategies to help students  grow in reading.   Learning rounds -3B- discuss planning around engaging  students in giving and receiving feedback.  After each data analysis , teachers will utilize information to  strengthen instructional tasks and questioning techniques  and form strategy groups based on data.  After each data cycle (September, January, March, June)  each grade level team will have a data meeting with their  immediate supervisor during which time teachers will  action plan.  Teachers College staff development and PD calendar days  will include reading intervention strategies. After school  foundations cycles will be implemented.  Service providers for SETTS & ESL will be included in all  reading professional developments in order to support  students with IEPs and ELLs in their growth and progress.  Students will track their own reading progress and be able  to verbalize their growth through the use of leadership  notebooks. They will have a personalized reading goal that  is tracked throughout the year.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38     may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39            IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS/MS 165 ,    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for  creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student  achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by  actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are  encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee  as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.         PS/MS 165 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting School/Family events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, and to the  extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?    WHAT FORMATIVE ASSESSMENTS OR CURRICULUM-EMBEDDED ASSESSMENTS (E.G. EL SOL, ESTRELLITA, FOUNTAS AND  PINNELL, DRA, TCRWP, TEACHER-CREATED ASSESSMENTS) ARE BEING USED TO GUIDE INSTRUCTIONAL PLANNING FOR YOUR  ELLS?  The formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments that we use at PS/MS 165 are the TCRWP/DYO running  records in English.  We also use the DRA (Developmental Reading Assessment) in Spanish.  The data that we have gathered  about our ELLs’ early literacy skills highlight the need for continued instruction in phonics, reading for fluency, and reading for  comprehension. Our students also have a need for greater vocabulary development.  These are the reasons we use  Flocabulary K-8, Fundations K-2, Words Their Way Spanish K-5. Gathering, reviewing, and studying our collective data allows   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      administrators and teachers to plan instruction with horizontal and vertical alignment.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2. WHAT STRUCTURES DO YOU HAVE IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT?    Staff developers from Teachers College provide professional development to our teachers throughout the year.  We also have  a full-time Literacy Coach and a full-time Math Coach to support our teachers and staff.  They support the implementation of  Flocabulary, Fundations, and Words Their Way Spanish to increase student engagement in vocabulary.    We also look at data to guide instruction.  With the NYSESLAT, for example, the breakdown of the four subscores (Listening,  Reading, Writing, and Speaking) tells us about our children’s strengths and weaknesses.  At the beginning of each school year,  the ENL Teacher gives to classroom teachers the ATS printouts with their students’ subscores.  This way, teachers know what  to address as they work with their ELLs.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?     3.  WHAT SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENTS OR BASELINE/BENCHMARK ASSESSMENTS (E.G. NYC PERFORMANCE TASKS,  PERFORMANCE SERIES, ELL PERIODIC ASSESSMENT, HLA ASSESSMENT) ARE BEING USED TO IDENTIFY BASELINE, PROGRESS,  AND AREAS OF NEED?    We use the NYC Performance Tasks in reading and writing from grades 3-8, and the NYC Performace Tasks in Math from  grades 3-5.  We also use the CGA Cognitive Growth Assessment in Math from grades K-5.  We used the ELE (Spanish Exam) in  Grades 3-8.            4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    4.  WHAT STRUCTURES DO YOU HAVE IN PLACE TO ADDRESS INTERVENTIONS ONCE THE SUMMATIVE DATA HAS BEEN  GATHERED?      Teachers are required to teach in small groups every day.  In reading, teachers hold guided reading groups daily.  Another  routine we have is cognitively guided instruction.  There is also a daily guided Math group.     Every day, we have 15 minutes of Number Talks with the students.  This is a short lesson (in addition to their Math periods) in  which different strategies are taught to solve mathematical problems.  In grade 3, for example, a lesson can be about how to  make landmark or friendly numbers to solve two-digit addition problems.  For our ELLs, it is beneficial to learn numerous  strategies that they can apply independently in their work to help them succeed.    Students in grades 6-8 have Advisory classes.  They also have weekly intervention classes.  Students are grouped according to  ENL, ELA, or Math levels.  They are provided targeted small-group instruction.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]         5. HOW DOES YOUR SCHOOL USE DATA TO GUIDE INSTRUCTION FOR ELLS WITHIN THE RESPONSE TO INTERVENTION (RTI)  FRAMEWORK (FOR GRADES K-5).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57           Data is gathered on ELLs whom we see as at-risk for academic difficulties.  Such data can be teachers’ conferring notes, exit  tickets, class tests, DYO running records, performance-based tasks, state assessments, and student work.  RTI is an  instructional model that aims at prevention through a tiered system of instructional support.  Levels of intervention and  instruction increase over time.  As students improve, the extra supports are removed.  There are three tiers of instruction and  intervention support.  Based on all the data that is gathered on students, we can then determine how to best support the  learner within the tiers.  Tier 1 is the instructional core that incorporates differentiation for the ELLs.  Tiers 2 and 3 provide a  more targeted and intensive academic support.  To improve our students’ language needs, for example, we determine the  students’ language levels and introduce language objectives into every lesson. Instruction is tailored to meet the language  needs of our ELLs.        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   6. WHAT OUTCOME ASSESSMENTS (E.G. NYSESLAT, ELA, MATH, REGENTS) DATA ARE USED TO EVALUATE AND INFORM YOUR  ELL PROGRAMS?    The data from the ELA, State Math Exam, and NYSESLAT are used to evaluate and inform our ELL programs. The staff is also  provided with results from the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT), which lets them know, for example, if their students are in  danger of becoming a long-term ELL due to consecutive years of a low LAT score or due to poor attendance.  Teachers are also  provided the ATS printout of their students’ NYSESLAT scores.  The breakdown of the 4 subtests (Speaking, Listening, Reading,  and Writing) lets the teachers know how each ELL performed on the 4 modalities.  This helps teachers understand their ELLs’  strengths and challenges, along with next steps for each child.              7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   7. WHAT STRUCTURES DO YOU HAVE IN PLACE TO DISSEMINATE THESE FINDINGS IN ORDER TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO YOUR  PROGRAMS?    Teachers meet in grade-level meetings once a month to review the progress of ELLs, determine the best practices, and next  steps.  For our middle-school dual-language class, we looked at the LAT data and decided how the Spanish instruction would  be given.  Math, Science, and Social Studies would be taught in Spanish, while ELA would be taught in English.  The LAT scores  were also looked at for scheduling of the standalone / integrated programming.  In the elementary dual-language program,  ELA and Math data are used to differentiate instruction. When we have had Newcomers in the dual-language program, if it has  been determined through assessment that the ELLs are low in Spanish, we let these Newcomers stay with the Spanish- component teacher on a daily basis.  After the initial few months of adjustment, we then start to transition the Newcomers  into the 50/50 model of English and Spanish.  We continue to meet on a regular basis to determine how to best meet the  needs of our ELLs.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         a.  Freestanding ENL program.      FREESTANDING ENL PROGRAM    ENL is delivered through a standalone and integrated model.  In standalone, ELLs receive instruction in order to  acquire English in core content courses.  In integrated ENL, ELLs receive core content area (ELA, math, science, or  social studies) and English language development instruction from either a dually certified teacher or from an ESL- certified teacher.  In integrated ENL, the ENL teacher stays in the classroom with the classroom teachers.  They work with ELLs during  content instruction in collaboration with classroom teachers to provide language acquisition and vocabulary support  while retaining content instruction time. The ENL teacher and classroom teachers plan together in order to run the  lessons smoothly.  Student learning is also maximized.  No time is lost for travelling between classes.  For the  standalone model, the grade levels do not exceed 2 contiguous grades unless it is a self-contained Special Ed Class.  In  both models, we aim to group the students homogeneously.  If the groups are heterogeneous, the students are  usually no more than one proficiency level apart.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.        We do not have a TBE program.      c.  DL program.  If applicable.         DL PROGRAM     In the Dual Language classes, grades K, 1, 5, and 6-8 are self-contained.  One teacher is with the same group of  children all year and teaches in English and Spanish, alternating the language each day.  Grades 2, 3, and 4 are side- by-side.  In a side-by-side model, there are two Dual Language teachers for that grade.  In grade 2, for example, the  Dual Language classes are 203 and 204.  The children of 203 study one full day in English, and on the next day they  switch to Spanish with the teacher of 204.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              2. HOW DOES THE SCHOOL ENSURE THE MANDATED NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES IS PROVIDED ACCORDING TO  PROFICIENCY LEVELS IN EACH PROGRAM MODEL?    a.  HOW ARE EXPLICIT ENL, ELA, AND HLA INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES DELIVERED IN EACH PROGRAM MODEL (SEE CHARTS 5.1  AND 5.2 BELOW)    The ENL Teacher works with our ELLs in the monolingual classes.  She maintains records of our ELLs school-wide and full serves  all the ELLs according to their levels of ENL.  The Dual Language classroom teachers are also aware of their ELLs’ proficiency  status.  As per 154.2, ELLs are entitled to either 180 or 360 minutes of ENL per week.  ELLs who score Entering or Emerging are  entitled to 2 units of ENL study per week.  ELLs who score Transitioning or Expanding get 1 unit of ENL study per week.  Former  ELLs who scored Commanding must continue to receive services for two more years.  They get .5 unit (90 minutes) of ENL  study per week.  Home language support for ELLs is never zero. In freestanding ENL, for example, 25% of home language arts instruction is the  students’ home language.  Teachers have a variety of resources to support our students’ home language needs: they speak   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      and teach in the home language; they have classroom libraries with books in multiple languages; with low-incidence languages  the teachers use Google Translate, iTranslate, and Google images.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   3.  DESCRIBE HOW CORE CONTECT IS DELIVERED IN EACH PROGRAM MODEL.SPECIFY LANGUAGE, AND THE INSTRUCTIONAL  APPROACHES AND METHODS USED TO MAKE CONTENT COMPREHENSIBLE TO FOSTER LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT AND MEET  THE DEMANDS OF THE COMMON CORE LEARNING STANDARDS.      All our teachers are committed to advancing the English proficiency of our ELLs.   In our Spanish and English Dual Language  program, the language of instruction depends on the day, language, and teacher.    The ENL Teacher works with the ELLs in the monolingual classes.  She maintains records of our ELLs schools-wide and fully  serves the ELLs according to their levels of ENL.  ELLs are entitled to either 180 or 360 minutes of ENL per week.  Based on the  ENL proficiency levels of the ELLs, they are mandated a specific number of minutes of ENL per week and guided on how service  should be provided.    The ENL Teacher uses ESL methodologies to enrich language development.  She aligns her lessons with those of the classroom  teachers.  Our literacy curriculum is the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project.  Realia, graphic organizers, Total  Physical Response (TPR), role-playing, picture books, songs, and manipulatives are some of the tools and strategies used to  scaffold our ELLs’ learning.  Teachers take into consideration the students’ learning styles: tactile, kinesthetic, visual, or  auditory.  The ELLs’ teachers also employ ENL strategies as they teach their students in English and Spanish.  All teachers of  ELLs modify their use of English to teach core subjects in order to ensure that the material is comprehensible to learners and  that it promotes their new language development.  Teachers adjust the language demands of the lesson in numerous ways by  modifying speech rate and tone; by teaching direct instruction of grammar and vocabulary; by repeating key words, phrases,  and concepts; by using context clues and making extensive use of modeling strategies; and by relating instruction to students’  background knowledge and experience.  Dual language teachers have resources for the students in English and Spanish.  The  ENL Teacher has resources such as iPads and bilingual dictionaries to support the ELLs’ native languages.  This enriches content  comprehension and language development.     We have three mobile carts that hold 25 iPads each.  Teachers can borrow and use these with their students.  Students have  used them with Lightsail, an online reading program.  Our school has two computer labs: one for the elementary school and  one for the middle school.    Teachers use their interactive Smartboards to enrich content-area instruction and language development.  Google Images and  Google Earth, for example, provide visuals so that students can internalize information better.  We also incorporate a daily ten- minute Brain Break that allows the students to dance and move while listening to a kid-friendly song.  During Brain Break,  teachers download “Go Noodle” videos and songs.  Our kids watch children sing and dance in the videos, and they can sing and  dance along. This fun activity is a great opportunity to get our students moving and singing.  They are more focused when they  resume academic instruction.    Our literacy materials include levelled libraries in English and Spanish, Fundations K-2, Estrellita K-2, and we are about to start  using Palabras a Su Paso.  Our Science and Social Studies materials include hands-on tools such as maps, globes, scales,  measuring cups, magnifying glasses, balancing scales, graduated cylinders, beakers, funnels, flasks, measuring spoons, and  droppers.  Culminating field trips enhance the children’s understanding and appreciation of the lessons taught.    Our math curriculum is Bridges in Mathematics K-5 and CMP3 Connected Math for 6-8.  Monolingual and Dual Language  teachers from grades K-8 supplement their Math instruction with Math Exemplars, a higher critical-thinking program that  teaches critical thinking skills.  Challenging word problems are presented and teachers help students analyze how to dissect   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      each problem to reach the correct answer.  Teachers also supplement their Math lessons with manipulatives such as cubes  and longs, practice clocks, decks of playing cards, tape measures,  3-D shapes, fraction strips, and scientific  calculators.  Students also have a 15-minute block for Number Talks three days a week and Cognitive Guided Instruction (CGI)  two days a week.             4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   4.  HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT ELLS ARE APPROPRIATELY EVALUATED IN THEIR HOME LANGUAGES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR?    The overwhelming majority of ELLs at our school come from Spanish-speaking families.  If the students are entitled for testing  based on Home Language Information Survey (HLIS), the NYSITELL is the first assessment administered.  If the child does not  pass and is therefore an ELL for the year, then the Spanish LAB is administered if Spanish is the home language.  Teacher tests  are given to assess progress during the year.  In Dual Language classes, a Spanish reading test called El Examen de Lectura en  Espanol (ELE) is given to students in grades 3-8.  The DRA is also an assessment used to evaluate proficiency in the native  language throughout the year.              5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       5.  HOW DO YOU DIFFERENTIATE INSTRUCTION FOR EACH OF THE FOLLOWING ELL SUBGROUPS:    A) SIFE:    Students who are considered Students With Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) come to school with many challenges.  The  children have had interruptions with their formal education and therefore come to an English language school system  academically behind in comparison with    their peers.  For these children, the transfer of the first language (L1) to the second language (L2) is challenging because their  knowledge and skills in L1 are not on grade level.  For these students, intense instruction in L1 has to be provided before  L2.  The trend with our SIFE population has been that they come from Spanish-speaking households and the parents always  choose to place their children into the Dual Language program.  To help our ELLs who are SIFE, upper-grade teachers  collaborate with lower-grade teachers to learn primary-grade strategies and to borrow primary-grade resources and books  that they can use in small groups with SIFE.  This way, instruction can be differentiated with the use of picture books, realia, or  graphic organizers.  The language of instruction is Spanish.     B) Newcomers:    ELLs who have been in school for less than three years also receive the mandated number of minutes that they are entitled to  for ENL services.  Instruction is tailored to the needs of the ELLs, whether it is for phonics, fluency, or reading for  comprehension.  Since ELLs are required to take the ELA after one year, they participate in rigorous test preparation  lessons.  In addition to ELA test prep during the school day, we hold after school Test Prep programs.  Our certified teachers  work with ELLs and offer ELA instruction 2 days a week and Math test prep 2 days a week.  We use Fundations K-2, Words   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      Their Way Spanish K-5, and Flocabulary K-8.    C) Developing:    Developing ELLs receiving ENL service from 4-6 years are at risk of becoming long-term ELLs. Small-group instruction during the  day is tailored to these children’s needs.  Strategy groups are formed in which teachers help students develop literacy skills by  teaching Balanced Literacy.  Activities can include Shared Reading, Guided Reading, or Read Alouds.  The focus is on  vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension.  We have used Ready New York ELA and Ready New York Math.  We use Flocabulary  K-8, and Words Their Way Spanish K-5.  Academic after school programs are also provided to further support their needs.    D) Long-Term ELLs:    Long-term ELLs continue to receive the mandated number of ENL minutes to which they are entitled.  Small groups are  strategically set up throughout the day to provide differentiation of instruction for students.  Strategy groups are formed in  which teachers help students develop literacy skills by teaching Balanced Literacy.  Activities can include Shared Reading,  Guided Reading, or Read Alouds.  The focus is on vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension.  We have used Ready New York ELA  and Ready New York Math.  We use Flocabulary K-8.  Dual Language classroom teachers have class libraries filled with books in  English and Spanish, and textbooks in both languages.     E) Former ELLs up to two after exiting ELL Status    Former ELLs are entitled to 2 more years of ENL service.  They get .5 unit of ENL study, which is equal to 90 minutes.  The  instruction should be integrated.  Classroom teachers and out-of-classroom staff continually meet to discuss the needs of the  former ELLs.  For those former ELLs who are in grades 3 and above, they are entitled to testing modifications when they take  state exams.  This applies for two years after they have passed the NYSESLAT.  For the Math and Science tests, these former  ELLs are entitled to accommodations such as bilingual glossaries, test booklets in English and in the home language (if  available), and an oral interpreter (if a test booklet in the home language is not available).  Even though these former ELLs  passed of out the NYSESLAT, the ENL teacher and classroom teachers still need to differentiate instruction by tailoring to the  needs of the student.               6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?      6.  WHAT INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES AND GRADE-LEVEL MATERIALS DO TEACHERS OF ELL-SWDS USE THAT BOTH PROVIDE  ACCESS TO ACADEMIC CONTENT AREAS AND ACCELERATE ENGLISH LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT?      Some of our ELLs have special needs, and we provide services in accordance with the children’s Individualized Education  Programs (IEPs) and mandates for ENL services.  The ENL service is provided via the integrated and standalone  models.  Teachers use scaffolding techniques to provide access to academic content areas and to accelerate English language  development.  Graphic organizers are a visual tool for students to divide information into categories.  They are also useful in  helping students plan for their writing.  The use of realia stimulates learning and gets students engaged in the lessons.  In dual  language classrooms, word walls are in both English and Spanish.  Words around the room are color-coded: labels in English  are blue, and labels in Spanish are red.  The color differentiation between languages is especially helpful for ELL-SWDs.  We  realize that allowing extra time for ELL-SWDs to orally respond gives them the opportunity to process their thoughts before  articulating aloud.  Helping them feel safe and empowered increases their sense of ownership in their education.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62               7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  7.  HOW DOES YOUR SCHOOL USE CURRICULAR, INSTRUCTIONAL, AND SCHEDULING FLEXIBILTIY TO ENABLE ELL-SWDS TO  ACHIEVE THEIR IEP GOALS AND ATTAIN ENGLISH PROFICIENCY WITHIN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT?    We are fully aware that each child comes to our school with his or her individual strengths and needs.  The diverse needs of  ELL-SWDs within the least restrictive environement are met with continual consultation among classroom teachers and  specialists who provide ENL, Speech, SETSS, Occupational Therapy, Audiology, Pjysical Therapy, and Counseling.  We have  provided flexible scheduling for students who benefit from it.  An example of this has been a child who sits in a self-contained  special ed class but studies Math in an ICT class setting because that curriculum is a better challenge for him.  This  accommodation is an example for how a child gets closer to achieving his IEP goals.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  8.  DESCRIBE YOUR TARGETED INTERVENTION PROGRAMS FOR ELLS IN ELA, MATH, AND OTHER CORE CONTENT AREAS  (SPECIFY ELL SUBGROUPS TARGETED).LIST THE RANGE OF INTERVENTION SERVICES OFFERED IN YOUR SCHOOL FOR THE  ABOVE AREAS AS WELL AS THE LANGUAGE(S) IN WHICH THEY ARE OFFERED.    For all of the programs mentioned, the language used during instruction is either English or Spanish.  We offer targeted  intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, Math, and other content areas in English or Spanish, depending on the class in which  students are being taught.    Every day, we have 15 minutes of Number Talks with the students.  This is a short lesson (in addition to their Math periods) in  which different strategies are taught to solve mathematical problems.  In grade 3, for example, a lesson can be about how to  make landmark or friendly numbers to solve two-digit addition problems.  For our ELLs, it is beneficial to learn numerous  strategies that they can apply independently in their work to help them succeed.    Students in grades 6-8 have Advisory classes.  They also have weekly intervention classes.  Students are grouped according to  ENL, ELA, or Math levels.  They are provided targeted small-group instruction.    We have one full-time Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS) Teacher and one DOE IEP Teacher.  They work with  children who have special needs, some of whom are ELLs.  They provide small-group intensive instruction in ELA, Math,  Science, and Social Studies.  The SETSS provider teaches in English and in Spanish, depending on the students’ IEP mandates for  language of instruction.    A Second Literacy period occurs every day.  Elements of this instructional block include the teaching of sight words and the use  of the Flocabulary program.  Flocabulary is a specialized vocabulary program in which students learn challenging words.  There  are visual and interactive components.  It is engaging for the students because there is an online library of educational hip-hop  songs and videos that help the children learn the meanings of the new words.    For word study, we are using Flocabulary K-8.  Students in K-2 are also studying with Fundations.  Students in Dual Language K- 5 use Words Their Way (Palabras a Su Paso) Spanish.  We also offer numerous after school academic programs to suit our  children’s needs such as ENL Newcomers, ELA test prep, and Math test prep.  All teachers follow the State Standards and review periodic assessments to develop the targeted instructional lessons that  address the needs of their students.  They are aware of the goals and standards that students need to achieve.  Based on the  data and knowledge of the students, teachers create differentiated lessons for the targeted intervention.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63               9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      9. BASED ON DATA AND TRENDS, WHAT NEW PROGRAMS OR IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR THE UPCOMING  SCHOOL YEAR?  We are introducing Palabras a Su Paso K-2, an engaging phonics program that will be used in addition to the word study  resources mentioned above.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We do not plan on discontinuing any programs/services for ELLs.          11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  11.  HOW ARE ELLS AFFORDED EQUAL ACCESS TO ALL SCHOOL PROGRAMS?DESCRIBE AFTER SCHOOL AND SUPPLEMENTAL  SERVICES OFFERED TO ELLS IN YOUR BUILDING.    ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs by participating in everything in which their peers are involved.  The  PS/MS 165 calendar is sent home monthly and is written in English and Spanish.  All school notices for parents are also written  in English and Spanish.  ELLs are given priority when notices about the ENL after school programs are sent home.  Our Parent  Coordinator works closely with families and community organizations to provide contact information and assistance with after  school and supplemental services to our ELLs.    We have partnered with organizations and nearby universities to provide supplemental services for our ELLs and our entire  student body.  Some of our partnerships are with Teachers College, Bank Street College, and The New York Philharmonic.    ELLs are invited to participate by receiving invitations and letters.    Our goals are for the ELLs to interact and learn with native speakers; to improve their oral language; to improve their academic  skills across all subjects; and to enjoy being at school.  The rationale for the programs is to provide the necessary social and  academic support for our English Language Learners.  It is crucial that we help ELLs with socialization and academic skills.  We  need to help them acclimate to their new culture while helping them acquire a new language.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.        12.  WHAT INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY, ARE USED TO SUPPORT ELLS?INCLUDE CORE CONTENT  AREA AS WELL AS LANGUAGE MATERIALS; LIST ELL SUBGROUPS IF NECESSARY.    To support our ELLs, we use a variety of instructional materials.  Our literacy curriculum is the Teachers College Reading and  Writing Project.  Teachers have levelled books in their classroom libraries.  Dual language classroom teachers have class  libraries filled with books in English and Spanish, as well as textbooks in both languages.  We have a school library and are  fortunate to have a full-time volunteer librarian who accommodates class visits and helps students borrow books to bring  home.  The ENL Teacher has a library in her room specifically for ELLs to borrow books.  Bilingual glossaries (downloaded from  Steinhardt NYU /  New York State Ed / The University of New York) have also been provided to our ELLs in Spanish and other  languages as needed in the subjects of Math, Science, and Social  Studies.  This helps our ELLs with their classwork and can also  be used during the State Math and Science Exams.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64        We have a Technology Cluster Teacher who runs our Computer Lab.  We are also fortunate to have a full-time volunteer who  assists in the Computer Lab.  We have three sets of 25 iPads that are kept in carts.  These are checked out by teachers to use  with their students throughout the year.  Apps have been downloaded in English and Spanish.  We have three iPads for ELLs in  the monolingual classes.  These students have used phonics apps to practice, for example, grammar activities or Math  games.  Every classroom at PS/MS 165 has a Smartboard to enhance lessons across all subject areas.  Teachers use programs  such as Brain Pop, Google Images, Go Noodle, and Learning A-Z.  Teachers can facilitate the lessons or allow students to  interact with the Smartboard.  We also have a new Computer Lab and three laptop carts exclusively for students in grades 6-8.     Our math curriculum is Bridges to Mathematics.  Monolingual and Dual Language teachers supplement their Math instruction  with Math Exemplars, a program that helps students understand the processes by which Math word problems are  solved.  Challenging word problems are presented and teachers help students comprehend how to dissect each problem to  reach the correct answer.  Teachers also supplement their Math lessons with manipulative such as cubes and longs, practice  clocks, decks of playing cards, 3-D shapes, and fraction strips.  They also use their interactive Smartboards and depending on  the grade, also have scientific calculators.  We also have a 15-minute daily block set aside to do Number Talks with the  students.           13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   13.  HOW IS HOME LANGUAGE SUPPORT ASSESSED AND DELIVERED IN EACH PROGRAM (DL, TBE, AND ENL)?    Currently we offer Dual Language and ENL.  Native language support is delivered through a 50/50 model in our Dual Language  programs in grades K-8.  All the teachers in our Dual Language program, including those who teach the English component, are  fluent in Spanish and can provide native language support for the ELLs as needed.  We teach phonics instruction and use  picture books and pictionaries as deemed necessary.  The ENL Teacher has downloaded bilingual glossaries from the website  of the State Ed Department / The University of the State of New York in language such as Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Korean, or  Haitian.  For grades 3-5 and 6-8, these glossaries are available for Math, Science, and Social Studies.  Glossaries have been  provided for our ELLs, who use them for classwork and homework.  These glossaries can also  be used as part of their testing  modifications for the State Math and Science Tests.  The ENL Teacher also has children’s and adults’ dictionaries in Croatian,  French, Farsi, Spanish, Chinese, Polish, Portuguese, and Russian to use with students to provide native language support.  As for home language assessment, the overwhelming majority of ELLs at our school come from Spanish-speaking families.  If  the students are entitled for testing based on the Home Language Information Survey (HLIS), the NYSITELL is the first  assessment administered.  If the child does not pass and is therefore an ELL for the year, then the Spanish LAB is administered  if Spanish is the home language.  Teacher tests are given to assess progress in the home language during the year.  In Dual  Language classes, a Spanish reading test called El Examen de Lectura en Espanol (ELE) is given to students in grades 3-8.  The  DRA is also an assessment used to evaluate proficiency in the native language throughout the year.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    14.   EXPLAIN HOW THE SCHOOL ENSURES ALL REQUIRED SERVICES/RESOURCES SUPPORT AND CORRESPOND TO ELLS’ AGES  AND GRADE LEVELS.    Required services support and resources correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  Throughout the year, there is close  contact among the classroom teachers and out-of-classroom teachers.  We need to ensure that the materials and resources  being used are age and grade appropriate.  We also confer with the ELLs to see how challenging the tasks at hand are.  The  support has to be “just right” in order for the child to need less and less scaffolding.  Only by focusing on the child and meeting  with teachers will the ELLs’ teachers understand whether the support is appropriate.  For our ELLs who also have IEPs, two of them are Alternative Assessment NYSAA.  Even though they are listed as being at a  certain grade, we follow their dates of birth to ensure that the NYSAA tests correspond to their ages and not the ATS grade  code.  This is an example of how the required services correspond to the students’ ages.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?       15.  IF YOUR SCHOOL SHARES A BUILDING (CO-LOCATION), HOW DO YOU SHARE RESOURCES AND/OR COORDINATE EFFORTS  TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE ELLS’ NEEDS (ACADEMIC, LINGUISTIC, SOCIOEMOTIONAL) ARE MET?    We share the gymnasium, cafeteria, and auditorium with another school.  This sharing of space allows ELLs from both schools  to participate in all that their schools have to offer.  The gymnasium has been used by the other school to have, for example,  their Career Day.  The auditorium has been used by our school, for example, for graduations and performances by The New  York Philharmonic.  This sharing of public space has been beneficial for ELLs’ and their families as they participated in their  children’s school activities.           16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   16.  DESCRIBE ACTIVITIES IN YOUR SCHOOL THAT ASSIST NEWLY ENROLLED ELLS BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL  YEAR.  INCLUDE ACTIVITIES FOR NEW ELLS WHO ENROLL THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL YEAR.  INCLUDE TITLES OF STAFF  INVOLVED IN SUCH ACTIVITIES.    Before the beginning of the school year, we hold “Meet and Greet” Orientations for all families in grades K-8.  This is how we  welcome families to the PS/MS 165 school community. The meetings are hosted by Administrators, the Parent Coordinator,  Classroom Teachers, and parent volunteers of the Parent-Teacher Association.  Since some of these families’ children will be  ELLs for the upcoming year, our Meet and Greets are a wonderful way for children and parents to meet their new teachers and  other staff of the school.    We also have a Curriculum Night every September.  Parents can learn about the curriculum that their children will be studying  throughout the year.  We also host a Math Night, in which children and their families can learn about the specific Math  curriculum they will be using.  Participants also get to try out Math games that teachers use, so that strategies can practiced at  home to help improve students’ Math skills.    Throughout the year, we offer Open Classrooms on Friday mornings.  The grades are rotated throughout the year.  For each  grade, parents have seven Fridays when they can come into their children’s classrooms and stay for the morning.  These are  wonderful opportunities for parents to see their children’s classes in action. On a certain morning they can see, for example,  how the teacher teaches a Math lesson, a literacy lesson, or a 7 Habits lesson (part of our Leader in Me Program).           17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?     Our school has a Dual Language program from grades K-8.  This means that the language elective for ELLs is Spanish for those  in the Dual Language program.              18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   18.    A)  At PS/MS 165, the target language is used 50% of the time for EPs and ELLs in each grade.EPs and ELLs  are integrated during all lessons, as facilitated by our skilled teachers.For K-1 and 5, the Dual Language is  self-contained.Grades 3-4 and 6-8 are side-by-side.The EPs and ELLs are integrated 100% of the time.    B) Content areas are taught in both English and Spanish.    C)   At our school, language is separated for instruction by time, room, and teacher.In the middle school,  language is separated by time, teacher, and subject.For example, in fourth grade, the students in 403 see  the 403 teacher on Monday and spend all day with her being taught in English.On Tuesday, 403 will  spend the day with the teacher of 404 and learn all day in Spanish.On Wednesday, 403 will go back to the  teacher of 403 and learn all day in English.The pattern continues: English, Spanish, English Spanish.    D)  Emergent literacy is taught in the native language first. As students progress to higher levels, both  languages are then taught at the same time For example, a new 4th grade ELL in dual language could  spend the first month or two with 404 learning in Spanish only, all day every day.The child then follows  the side-by-side model and moves with his classmates, from 403, to 404, and back to 403.          Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?        DESCRIBE THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR ALL ELL PERSONNEL AT THE SCHOOL (INCLUDE ALL TEACHERS OF ELLS  AND NON-PEDAGOGICAL STAFF).WHAT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS OFFERED TO TEACHERS OF ELLS (INCLUDING ENL  AND BILINGUAL TEACHERS) IN SUPPORTING ELLS AS THEY ENGAGE IN THE COMMON CORE LEARNING STANDARDS?  Many of our classroom teachers have ELLs.  Staff developers from the TCRWP meet with teachers and related service providers  on a grade-by-grade level or on an individual basis at least once a month.  These outside consultants provide professional  development for our literacy curriculum.  Teachers College offers professional development workshops called Calendar Days  throughout the year for ENL teacher and classroom teachers of ELLs.  ELL personnel will attend professional development  workshops throughout the year.  Our literacy and math coaches work closely with staff to pass on information about  workshops available.  Staff will also attend PD at Teachers College Columbia University to continue learning about the TC  Reading and Writing Projects.  The NYCDOE’s Department of ELLs offers a variety of PD workshops that teachers can attend.  A  minimum of 15% of the required PD hours for all teachers must be focused on language acquisition.  For bilingual and ENL  teachers, at least 50% of the required PD hours will be focused on language acquisition and how it aligns with core content  area instruction.  For both groups of teachers, there will be a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating  language and content instruction.    At our school we have Grade Teams, in which there is one Grade Team leader for each grade.  Teachers meet weekly as a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67         grade for one hour to collaborate on plans, examine student data and student work, and specify next steps for teaching and  assessment.  The principal has monthly meetings with teachers in which they review student data and implications for  teaching and consider the next steps.  We have professional development every Monday 2:30-3:40.  All staff members participate.           2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  2.  DESCRIBE HOW YOUR SCHOOL MEETS THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS AS PER CR PART 154.2: 15% OF  TOTAL HOURS FOR ALL TEACHERS AND 50% OF TOTAL HOURS FOR BILINGUAL EDUCATION /ENL TEACHERS RECEIVE ELL- SPECIFIC PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.INCLUDE HOW RECORDS ARE KEPT FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES  (E.G. AGENDAS, ATTENDANCE).REFER TO ELL POLICY AND REFERENCE GUIDE, PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SECTION.    Our school will meet the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2 by having them attend the PD  workshops that are offered.  Every Monday, teachers have PD from 2:30-3:40.  Teachers can also request to attend PD  workshops offered by the UFT, FSC, and the Department of English Language Learners & Student Support DELLS.  They can  attend numerous workshops that TCRWP offers at Columbia University.  They will also attend PD workshops that our Literacy  or Math coaches host.  Agendas will be saved and attendance will be taken.  A minimum of 15% of the required PD hours for  all teachers must be dedicated to language acquisition.  For ENL teachers, a minimum of 50% of the required PD must be about  language acquisition in alignment with core content instruction.  An example of the PD that all teachers attended on a Monday  was a showcase from select classrooms who shared ways that they differentiated their lessons for students (many of whom  are ELLs).  One teacher showed us how she taught a Math game to all her third-graders.  When it was time to play, not all her  kids were ready for the full game.  The teacher shared how she differentiated the game for four different groups.  This way,  even her Newcomers were able to access the game and play, even if it was different from what an advanced group was  playing.  There was discussion among teachers on how different groups of ELLs in the class can acquire and use language while  playing the game.             Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?      HOW DOES THE SCHOOL PROVIDE ANNUAL INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS WITH PARENTS OF ELLS TO DISCUSS GOALS OF THE  PROGRAM, LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS, LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY ASSESSMENT RESULTS, AND LANGUAGE  DEVELOPMENT NEEDS IN ALL CONTENT AREAS?INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR INTERPRETATION AND TRANSLATION AS  NEEDED.NOTE THESE MEETINGS DO NOT INCLUDE MANDATED PARENT ORIENTATION MEETINGS AND DOE-SCHEDULED  PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCES?  In addition to the mandated parent orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled Parent-Teacher Conferences, teachers of ELLs  must meet with the parents at least once a year to discuss the children’s overall progress.  Sign-in attendance is taken and  translation services with parents are provided when necessary.  Every Tuesday from 2:30-3:05 is Parent Engagement time  when teachers and parents can meet.  These scheduled weekly meetings are a wonderful opportunity for families to learn  about their children’s social, emotional, academic, and language development.  Parents can also learn about ways they can  support their children at home.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68            Our school has a website that shares information with our families.    Teachers send home a monthly newsletter that informs parents about the latest units of study across all subjects.  We use Big Word translation services to accommodate the needs of our parents.  This way we ensure that we can  communicate fully with our families.    We have found a Spanish Sign Language SSL interpreter for one of our families.  This way, the family and the teachers can  communicate about their child’s progress and the family is included in the child’s education process.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.      2.  DESCRIBE ELL PARENT INVOLVEMENT IN YOUR SCHOOL.INCLUDE SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES THAT FOSTER PARENTAL  INVOLVEMENT FOR PARENTS OF ELLS.    Monthly Parent –Teacher Association (PTA) meetings take place at our school and all parents are invited to attend and  participate.  During these meetings, various topics are discussed.  The PTA and Administrators are in close contact to address  the needs of the parents.  Workshops are offered to parents in which they can learn, for example, ways they can support their  children at home.  Parents can register and open a NYC Schools Account in which they can find out information about their  children’s progress at school.  They can find out the grades, attendance records, and other general information in one of ten  languages offered.  Parent Teacher Conferences are held two times a year.  For the other two evenings with parents, we offer  a Curriculum Night and a Promotion-in-Doubt Conference.  We offer “Open Classrooms” in which parents can sit in their  children’s classrooms to observe the classes in action seven Fridays a year.    We have an annual International Night.  This is a great way for families to showcase their cultures.  Families bring in potluck  dishes that are unique to their home countries.     We have a Spring Fair, Economic Fair, holiday celebrations, publishing parties, Muffins for Moms (to celebrate Mothers’ Day),  Donuts for Dad (to celebrate Fathers’ Day), End of the Year celebrations, Pre-K stepping up ceremony, Kindergarten  Graduation, Fifth Grade Graduation, Eighth Grade Graduation, and Character Day (in which teachers and students dress up as  their favorite book characters).    Families get free Raz Kids accounts to use at home.  This way, children can continue to read at home.  The middle school once again had their Fashion Talent Show.  The student MCs spoke in English and Spanish to introduce the  skits and performers.  Parents were invited and thoroughly enjoyed the show.    We hold annual Spelling Bees in English and in Spanish.    We give a Summer Resource Workshop that offers ideas on how their children can stay engaged when they are not in  school.  We inform parents about free or low-cost summer camps / programs, summer reading programs, free lunches at  schools that run summer school, and Summer in the City programs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Aracelis Castellano-Folkes, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities  are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Robert E.
