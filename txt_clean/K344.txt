This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of Rachel Carson High School is to provide every student with a student-centered and rigorous curriculum  that fosters critical thinking. We seek to ensure that each student displays grit, perseverance and empathy, is  prepared for  college or the world of work and has a post-graduation plan, is able to productively collaborate with peers, is open to  new  experiences, and is environmentally conscious. We expect that when students graduate from our school that they go  out   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      into the world as analytical, compassionate, thoughtful, and productive citizens who advocate for themselves and  those in  need.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Rachel Carson High School boasts a student population that is reflective of our community as well as surrounding  districts and boroughs. Our partnership with the New York Aquarium, The New York Peace Institute and other  institutions offer students opportunities for learning and developing experiences for educational excellence.    We are fortunate to have numerous collaborations with community partners. Among them is the New York Aquarium,  Kingsborough Community College, Malloy College, New York Wildlife Conservation Society, New York Environmental  Center, STEM Initiative, First Robotics, Sea perch Robotics, and Museum of Natural History.      Our students participated in projects and research at various sites and in classrooms. These included the Urban  Barcode Project, Horse shoe crab hatchery, STEM in the classroom and citywide presentations, International Robotics  Competition, Sea perch competition, and Intel Research competition.      We continue to utilize rigorous instructional practices that are designed to meet the needs of all constituencies,  especially our at-risk populations. We provided ICT classes for those students who are mandated for these supports.  We have implemented an ICT model for our English Language Learners (ELL) to ensure greater comprehension and  support in subject classes. Teachers continually utilize strategies to promote critical thought through the use of  Bloom’s measurable verbs to ensure that students are analyzing and responding to content topics at a level which  prepares them for college.   We have a supportive and nurturing environment which fosters student safety and focus on academics. All teaches  and administrators are known to the student body, and students are well known to all teachers. Additionally, the  2018-19 school year will be year four of our four year plan to embed restorative practices into our daily routines. This  plan includes providing students with weekly advisory sessions during 9th and 10th grade as well as taking new  approaches to disciplinary practices.   Our teachers meet collaboratively to plan lessons, activities and assessments that support student progress. Teachers  and administrators attend professional development city-wide and through our superintendency throughout the year.  Strategies learned are then turn-keyed to the entire staff.    The principal of our school ensures that teachers are given numerous opportunities to develop their craft by actively  identifying training and professional development as they become available. The staff at our school is well aware that  the principal and administrative staff always supports their growth and skills development to more ably engage our  students.   Parents and guardians are always welcome in our school. We are in ongoing contact with parents through letters,  phone messages and data system. We also meet with parents during PTA and SLT meetings as well as dedicated  meetings with parents of specific grades to inform them of upcoming events.   All staff members continually discuss student progress and supports. All constituencies are supportive of each other  and our school mission. For this school year we intend to further implement universal high standards for success in all   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      classrooms utilizing consistent approaches from class-to-class. We will support our learning environment though the  continued use of a Positive Reinforcement Behavior Initiative (PBRI).      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Students with special needs make up approximately 22% of our school population. We ensure that all of these  students receive all of their mandated services. Additionally, our English Learner students are also provided with  support in stand-alone and collaboratively taught classes to provide language skill development along with subject  content support. Theses students comprise approximately 20% percent of our population.       We continue to utilize rigorous instructional practices that are designed to meet the needs of all constituencies,  especially our at-risk populations. We provided ICT classes for those students who are mandated for these supports.  We have implemented an ICT model for our English Language Learners (ELL) to insure greater comprehension and  support in subject classes.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   We have made the most progress in the following areas:      Rigorous Instruction - Over the past year, our teachers have worked hard to deepen their knowledge of and  implement strategies for fostering student discussion. Additionally, they have continued to utilize annotation  strategies to promote student engagement with complex texts. This year we will be focusing on developing our  students' critical thinking skills as well as their ability to be metacognitive.      Effective School Leadership - Over the course of the 2018-19 school year, school leadership implemented new  accountability protocols including an enhanced version of our Assessment Data Tracker (a document on our Google  network that allows teachers to reflect on student achievement on specific assessments) and Scholarship Data  response form (also on our Google network, teachers have the opportunity to identify specific next steps to support  student progress) in an effort to provide students with the specific supports that they need to be successful. We also  implemented a guidance system called "Student Rebound Support" through which guidance counselors met weekly  with our most at risk students to provide both social emotional support and connect them with the necessary  academic supports to ensure their success.      Key areas of focus for the 2018-19 school year:      Rigorous Instruction - In the 2018-19 school year, we intend to focus our efforts on improving the rigor of classroom  tasks in all classrooms.

In the 2015-16 school year, Rachel Carson High School brought in the New York Peace Institute to support our  implementation of a Restorative Justice program. Since then, we have implemented advisories for freshman and  sophomore students and the use of restorative practices in lieu of traditional punitive discipline.   In the 2017-18 school year, we scheduled student advisories at the beginning of our students' day as opposed to the  end of the day as we had in previous years. This resulted in a dramatic drop in advisory attendance and an a rise in  student incidents and suspensions. At the end of the 17-18 school year, we registered a total of 58 suspensions, a  roughly 60% increase from the previous year.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element.

According to the 2017-18 School Environment Survey, only 74% "of teachers say the principal sets clear expectations  for teachers about implementing what they have learned in professional development." Additionally, our school's  shift to a multi session and initial lack of consensus on the appropriate use of professional time between teachers and  administration during the 17-18 school year resulted in a lack of professional learning for staff. This lack of  professional learning and comprehensive growth in pedagogical practices resulted in a decrease in passing percentage  for nearly every Regents examination for nearly every subgroup of students. We saw a particularly dramatic drop off  in passing for students with disabilities on the Living Environment Regents exam, with only 42.86% passing, dropping  from 73.1% passing the previous year.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, school leaders will implement and maintain a comprehensive system and approach to weekly  professional development, which will include specifically allocated time for co-teachers to plan and review student  work, resulting in a minimum 25% point increase of students with IEPs passing the Living Environment Regents  examination.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  We recruit teachers through the DOE recruitment fairs and through the Open Market transfer process. Prospective  candidates are asked to present a classroom lesson to school administrators to demonstrate competency in lesson  planning and content delivery. Hired teachers are provided with regular teaching schedules and assignments.  Teachers are assigned to an Academy based on subject and grade level. Academies and teams meet weekly to review  student progress and course content implementation.   Each new teacher is assigned a mentor for the first year. The mentor meets with the teacher several times per week  to assist in lesson planning and delivery. New teachers are also mentored by an assigned school administrator during  the school year. New teachers are provided assistance in lesson planning, classroom management, clerical  responsibilities by school administrators, mentors, and subject leaders. To ensure ongoing development of our new  staff members, we provide professional development by school administrators either individually or at weekly faculty  conferences. Additionally, professional development is provided through our Generation Ready consultants and  District specialists. New teachers are assisted in implementing inter-visitations to various classes in the school and to  community schools.           2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Our professional development is directly tied to our annual instructional focus. Teachers are presented with practical  strategies to support student needs and work collaboratively to conduct Student Work and Performance Task  protocols to ensure that instruction is appropriately rigorous and to guide teachers in making the shifts in practice  necessary to support students.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teachers are provided the leverage to select their own assessments for their students. However, teachers make use  of a collaborative document on our Google network through which they indicate the skills and standards assessed,  student strengths and weaknesses, and next steps for struggling and excelling students. Teachers then work in grade  or department teams to develop appropriate lesson and task modifications to address student needs.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35        Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. [Rachel Carson High School] , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School Act (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   [Rachel Carson High school] will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● Keeping our school website up-to-date with the latest information to keep parents informed;   PART IV ADOPTION    This School Parental Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact has been developed jointly with, and agreed  on with parents of children participating in Title I, Part A programs, as evidenced by the SLT and PTA of Rachel Carson  High School for Coastal Studies.   This policy was adopted by the Rachel Carson High School for Coastal Studies on 6 /18/2015 and will be in effect for  the period of one year. The school will distribute this policy to all parents of participating Title I, Part A children on or  before January 20, 2015.   _____________________________   (Signature of Principal)    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ___June 28, 2016 __________________________   (Date)                School-Parent Compact (SPC)   [Rachel Carson High School] , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary  School (ESSA) Act, is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student  achievement between the school and the families.

To support this task, we have implemented programs  which are designed to improve skills and culminate in advancement on the NYSESLAT exam.     We also intend to use the grant funding to support and service all immigrant students in 9-12th  grade, regardless of their English Language Learner status.    The programs that we offer are as follows:        After-school small group instruction  by ESL and content subject teachers on Wednesdays   from 2:50 PM to 4:00 PM.   1) Direct instruction for ENL students in after-school program: Living Environment ENL class.  2) Subgroups include Freshman ENL students (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning and  Expanding level ENL students) will receive extra support in English language skills and Living  Environment content to allow students achieve success in Living Environment class as well as on  the Living Environment Regent exam.  Also, ENL students in grades 10-12 who still require assistance in Living Environment or  English language skills are included in this after school program.        Saturday Academy  small group instruction by content subject teachers every Saturday   except on holiday weekends.  The hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM.         Ongoing support for former ELLS in after-school programs after they have demonstrated   proficiency in English as noted on the NYSESLAT exam.   Our student population is diverse and consists of immigrants from across the globe.  Some of the  countries represented are Russia, Georgia, Uzbekistan, China, Ukraine, Turkey, Pakistan,  Mexico, and various other Latin American countries.  Our ENL immigrant population is comprised of all high school grade levels, 9-12.  Additionally,  we serve the needs of students who have been identified as ELLs with IEPs.  We will provide after-school tutoring one day per week for one hour sessions for our ELL  population by our ENL staff and by Living Environment Teacher on Saturdays.  The Saturday  program will run from October 2018 until June, 2019.  All after-school programs will be in session between October, 2018 and June, 2019.  Our language of instruction for all ELL students is English.    Home language support is provided by in-school translations for parents as well as letters  translated into appropriate languages as available through the translation unit. In addition, school  staff frequently uses the over-the-phone interpretation services to communicate with guardians  and students about academic progress and school-related issues.     Our materials are separate from the classroom texts.  We use appropriate articles from National  Geographic which are leveled to support various language skills as well as Newseala and other  educational websites.  National Geographic articles are provided at no cost to our Title III   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   program. We also utilize dictionaries and glossaries in various languages to assist our students in  the classroom and on state exams.    In the 2018-19 academic year Rosetta Stone will be utilized in instruction to enhance the English  language skills of Entering, Emerging and Transitioning ELLs.   Teachers use classroom scholarship data as well as assessment data from NYSITELL and  NYSESLAT to identify and support student needs. Students need help in literacy and academic  writing.  Classes will be taught by a content teacher and an ENL teacher.  Teachers co-plan, co-teach and  implement instructional strategies for learning to meet every student's needs. Students are  grouped for instruction by proficiency level in their Stand Alone ESL classes.  Subject teachers as well as ENL teachers maintain records of student progress and meet to  review areas of need for each individual student and identify an action plan to help students  achieve proficiency both in their language skills and academic content.

It is the responsibility of  school administrators to ensure that the most current strategies are used by our staff. Strategies  are culled from current research, out of the building PDs and based on student needs.  All teachers of ELL students are notified of the language level of ELL students in Title III  programs in their classes.  We provide support to these teachers in the form of professional  development by our ENL teachers and by our Generation Ready consultants. Our ENL teachers  receive additional professional development by our consultants as well as our Field Support  Center, and through city-wide initiatives in an ongoing basis.   All staff receive their training  by our in-house ENL teachers and Generation Ready  consultants.  All staff members are acutely aware of the needs of our ELL population. Our  professional development is provided by our ENL staff and consultants to facilitate the tasks of  modifying content in order to benefit the understanding and academic progress of our ELL  students.  Our trainings take place at department meetings and at faculty conferences at  monthly meetings.  We maintain agendas, sign-in rosters and minutes of meetings.  Copies are  kept in the general office of the school.  Topics for discussion include differentiated instruction,  language acquisition strategies and  techniques of activating prior knowledge.     Our ENL teachers meet routinely with various departments during their monthly departmental  meetings.  At that time, the ENL teachers provide strategies in language acquisition  development.  Our ENL teachers have provided and continue to provide professional  development at faculty conferences as well.  They also provide strategies to use with individual  students.  Some of the topics covered are the use of extended time and  bilingual dictionaries and  glossaries for ELL students.  Instruction is provided through the use of glossaries, activating  prior knowledge and the benefits of visuals for those learning a new language.  All staff,  including our principal and assistant principals attend the professional development sessions.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         Part C: Professional Development   Some of our providers are our Generation Ready consultants and Field Support staff, as well as  in-house teaching staff.

Parents are the bond between the school and its students.  We continually reach out  to parents to inform them about their children's academic progress as well as to address their  concerns regarding their children’s education. Additionally, parents are also invited to attend  PTA meetings on a monthly basis to share their concerns. We also hold conferences for parents  of ENLs to introduce them to ENL content area classes and expectations. These meetings are  held in November, February and March after school.  The purpose of these meetings is to have  parental involvement and support for ENLs language development and ensure academic success.  We will also provide bi-monthly parent workshops/meetings offered to all ENL students. The  workshops will be conducted by Parent Coordinator and ENL teacher(s). The topics to be  covered include: Parent orientation, How to help your child succeed in school,  transcript and  graduation requirements,  college and career night and Family/Cultural celebrations. These  events will begin in November 2018 and run until June 2019. Each monthly workshop will run  for two hours each time in the afternoon/evening sessions.      We endeavor to support our parents with educational choices of ENL programs, programming  choices in courses, school safety, unique needs of those students who are IEP students, and any  other concerns that they may have.  We also provide tutorials on using our online credit recovery  and tutorial programs.  We provide professional development to parents to assist them in  accessing  Pupilpath parent link.  We also provide tutorials in reading and understanding student  transcripts and recognizing the State mandated graduation requirements.  These supports are given in November, February and March.  These tutorials are provided by our principal and assistant principals, guidance counselors,  college adviser, and parent coordinator.    To ensure that parents are well aware of these opportunities, we notify them through our phone  messenger system, letters backpacked and mailed as well as through translated mailings as are  available through the Translation and Interpretation Unit.  We endeavor to provide interpreters at  these meetings as needed.     Parent meetings will be scheduled with translated letter home.  Sessions will be structured to  include an agenda of the day's activities and relevant materials.  Sign in sheets will be maintained  to document attendance at meetings.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47   Part D: Parental Engagement Activities                      Professional salaries  (schools must account for  fringe benefits)                              Per session    Per diem   Purchased services     High quality staff   and curriculum  development  contracts.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  To assess the literacy skills of our ENL students, we use the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT assessments. This data indicates students'  language level and is broken down in terms of the four language modalities: Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing. This is  helpful because it shows exactly where each ENL student is at and what modality the student needs to improve on with the  support of ENL instruction and services. Therefore, this data provides ENL teachers with a detailed blue-print for planning and  designing instruction that is tailored to each individual ENL student's needs.    Additionally, our staff also uses teacher generated assessments along with internal tools like our Assessment Data Tracker to  monitor progress and make necessary shifts.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         Our ENL teachers make use of our Assessment Data Tracker--a document shared on our Google Network--through which  teachers record the skills being assessed for a given assessment, the strengths and weaknesses demonstrated by students, and  the modifications to meet the needs of struggling and excelling learners.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  As a small school, we are afforded the opportunity for our ENL teachers to create their own assessments (baseline,  benchmark, formative, and summative assessments) in an effort to monitor the progress of our ENL students.  Additionally,  our ENL teachers and school leadership review Regents data and marking period scholarship data to assess student needs.  Furthermore, our ENL teachers provide translated versions of class benchmark and summative assessments to support  students' HLA needs.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Our ENL teachers offer targeted supports to struggling learners in the form of freestanding instruction and  in various subject  areas, co-taught integrated teaching in  core subjects, such as Living Environment, ELA, Earth Science, Global History, US  Economy & Government, after school tutoring and Saturday school tutoring.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   NA     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSESLAT indicates students' language level and is broken down in terms of the four language modalities: Listening,  Speaking, Reading and Writing. This is helpful because it shows exactly where each ENL student is at and what modality the  student needs to improve on with the support of ENL instruction and services.  In addition to NYSESLAT results, school leadership carefully analyzed Regents results and identified Living Environment, Earth  Science, Global History, and English as areas of need.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   School leadership worked closely with ENL and subject area teachers to create ENL co-taught sections of Living Environment,  ELA, Earth Science and Global History. Each ENL student is given a program based on what Regents level classes they require  with support from an ENL teacher within that content area in order to aid comprehension of the subject matter. In other  words, all freshman ENL students receive CO-taught ENL classes with Living Environment in order to help them, achieve a solid  understanding of the subject and be successful on Living Environment regent exam. In addition, all freshman ENL students  receive co-taught ENL/ELA class to help them in achieving success in the English language and class.  In 10th grade, all ENL  students receive a program consisting of ENL/ELA co-taught class, Earth Science/ENL co-taught class in order to help students  be successful in the class and on the regent exams. In 11th grade, all ENL students receive a program consisting of ELA/ENL co- taught class and US History/ENL class to support students with these classes and to be successful on these regent exams.  Additionally, in 12th grade, all ENL students receive co-taught ELA/ENL class to  prepare them for college.  Furthermore, school leadership has hired an ENL consultant and an ELA/History Generation Ready Consultant to support ENL  planning and instruction in various core subject areas.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Students are homogeneously enrolled in ENL classes based on their levels. Entering students attend one ENL  freestanding class as well as several ENL integrated co-taught classes per day, for no less than 540 minutes per week.  Each Entering and Emerging student receives a unit of ELA/ENL co-taught class, A stand-alone ENL class and a co- taught content area class (Living Environment/ENL class). Emerging level students receive no less than 360 minutes  per week, comprised of a freestanding class and integrated co-taught classes.  Each Transitioning student at our school receives an ELA/ENL co-taught class and a content area with ENL co-taught  class, such as Living Environment/ENL, Earth Science/ENL, and US/History/ENL class).  Transitioning and Expanding students receive no less than 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week.  Each expanding student receives one unit of ELA/ENL or one content area/ENL class.    Commanding students receive no less than 90 minutes of integrated co-taught ENL instruction per week in a content  area where they require assistance in such, as major classes that terminate in a regent exam.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Students are enrolled in ENL classes based on their levels. Entering students attend one ENL freestanding class as well as  several ENL integrated co-taught classes per day, for no less than 540 minutes per week.  Emerging level students receive no less than 360 minutes per week, comprised of a freestanding class and integrated co- taught classes. During the programming we ensure that all Entering and Emerging level ENL students receive the  mandated number of instructional minutes in co-taught ELA classes as per CR Part 154.2     Transitioning and Expanding students receive no less than 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week. Commanding students  receive no less than 90 minutes of integrated co-taught ENL instruction per week.     The ENL and subject-area teachers all ensure that ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes are delivered in all classrooms  according to the following:  -all ENL students are provided with bilingual glossaries, dictionaries, and translated versions of classroom materials, which are  utilized simultaneously to promote home language and English language development and mastery.   - ENL and subject area teachers collaborate on the development of lessons and curricula that provide targeted supports for all  language learners.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Content classes are taught by the designated licensed teachers. Students are supported by the sharing of critical information  between the content area teachers and the respective ENL teachers. The ENL teachers then provide translations and  reading/writing support to assist the students in mastering the materials. Instruction in content classes is differentiated to  meet the needs of the various levels of ENL students language proficiency.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      Instructional approaches include: Team-teaching where the ENL teacher is responsible for making language comprehensible  and teaching Tier one and Two vocabulary while the content area teacher is responsible for teaching content words and  making the content comprehensible. Together both the ENL teacher and content-area teacher deliver instruction that focuses  on language and content at the same time.  Most importantly, in order to meet the demands of the CCLS, ENL teachers co-teach in various content area classes to foster  ENL, HLA, ELA, and content-area knowledge. To ensure that all ENL students will meet the demands of the NYS Learning  Standards, ENL teachers work collectively with their respective continent-area teachers to co-create and modify lessons based  on language level that also meet regent-level subject area requirements. In other words, the content area teacher shares  his//her unit plan and lesson plans with the ENL teacher and together they make adjustments and develop scaffolds for  vocabulary and literacy in order to aid student in developing language and content-area knowledge.  Additionally, core content instruction is delivered in the freestanding setting to provide supports in skill and content  knowledge to Entering and Emerging ENL students.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   We evaluate our ENL students in their native languages via teacher-generated assessments.  Moreover, ENL teachers provide  students with translated materials and assessments to further support student learning.  Students who are native Spanish  speakers are administered the Spanish Lab-R in addition to the NYSITELL exam.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a) Identified SIFE students are provided co-taught classes, scaffolded instruction and  tutoring in core subject-area classes to  assist them in developing their English language proficiency.  Each student that is identified as SIFE is provided with additional  support, based on their individual academic needs and initial diagnostic assesments. The SIFE students are scheduled for  required classes. They are also offered additional assessment preparation and review sessions after school. All SIFE students  receive extra support in co-taught Living Environment/ESL  Earth Science/ESL, ELA/ESL and History/ESL classes. These co- taught classes offer the students the differentiated instruction needed to make progress in the content area and in English  language skills. These students receive testing accommodations, such as extended time, translated versions as applicable and  available, dictionaries, glossaries on all assessments.  Also, separate location is provided as part of test accommodations on all  State Regents exams.      b) After the initial intake process, Newcomer students are placed in ENL classes based on their level  and receive English as a  New Language support in Content -area classes such as Living Environment, Earth Science, History, ELA classes and in stand  alone ENL classes if the language level requires. Also, these students are provided translations and other native language  supports in order to have access to content-area information and instruction. Newcomer and Developing students receive  continuous instructional support from all staff members. Test accommodations include extended time, translated versions,  dictionaries, glossaries on all class and Regents exams. Also, separate location and extended time are provided during Regents  exams.        c) Developing ENLs are provided support to ensure that they continue working towards language proficiency in English. These  students are provided with translations, dictionaries and other native language support in order to achieve academic success  in all content area classes. Besides these supports, time extension and separate location are provided on Regents exams to all  ENL students.            These students also receive support and differentiated instruction in co-taught classes, such as ELA, Living Environment,  Earth Science, and History classes.     d) Long-term ENLs receive additional support in integrated co-taught classes and tutoring during school days, during after  school, and during Saturday school. Test accommodations include extended time, translated questions as applicable and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      available, dictionaries, glossaries on all assessments. Separate location is provided as part of test accommodations on the State  Regent Exams.      e) Former ENLs continue to receive support in integrated co-taught classes as well as accommodations on assessments as  mandated by the appropriate regulations.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ENL students with IEPs are provided support by our ENL teachers as well as our ICT collaborating teachers. This target group of  students is offered additional tutoring in content and ELA classes. Students are allowed testing accommodations on all  assessments according to their IEPs. Materials to support this unique cohort of students are reviewed for academic rigor and  are ensured to meet the needs of students with below grade-level academic skills. Our SWDs are offered the state Regents  exams and we provide tutoring to ensure student success on these exams. The instructional strategies used for this group of  students' include the following: providing extended time for class work and assessments, audio-visual aids to students who are  eligible, sentence frames to aid in writing, word boxes to help with writing passages, read aloud and think aloud activities to  support understanding, group work, small teacher group work. Content-area teachers co-plan with ENL teachers and Special  Education teachers to set learning targets, modify instruction to support ENL/SWD students, pre-teach  vocabulary/concepts with use of visual and audio scaffolds and graphic organizers/charts to help students see connections  among concepts.           7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ENL students with IEPs are scheduled for either ICT or SETSS or related services as per the IEP. We ensure that students receive  the appropriate setting with the support of our Special Education teachers. The students in SETSS receive additional support by  their assigned teacher. All teachers of ENLs with IEPs are aware of students’ levels and support their academic, language and  social growth. Teachers provide additional remediation and tutoring as necessary as well as testing accommodations as noted  on the IEPs. These students are serviced in integrated co-taught content-area classes and receive support directly from content  area teachers, Special Education teachers, ENL teachers, paraprofessionals to ensure that their learning goals are met as  governed by IEPs.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  ENL students are supported in their content area classes by their respective teachers. Assessment results are reviewed to  identify areas in need of remediation. The ENL and designated content area teachers co-plan on a daily basis in order to create,  modify, deliver, and assess meaningful instruction. All teachers receive a list of our ENL students and their unique levels of  proficiency at the beginning of the school year.   For 9th grade, all ENL students receive a co-taught ELA/ENL class in order to develop and improve English language skills and  content area knowledge in English language arts. Also, all ENL students receive a co-taught Living Environment/ENL class to  develop and improve English language skills through the lens of science and to perform successfully on the Living Environment  Regents exam.  For 10th grade, all ENL students receive a co-taught content area class, such as Earth Science/ENL class to help students  develop English language and acquire scientific knowledge and to perform successfully on Earth Science regent exams.  For 11th grade, all ENL students receive a co-taught content area class, such as ELA/ENL to support with language acquisition  and to enable students to perform successfully on ELA Regents exam.  Also, for 11th grade, all ENL students receive a co-taught  US History/ENL class in order to help students develop language in in the subject and to be successful on the US History  Regents exam.  For 12th grade, all ENL students and former ENL students receive a co-taught ELA/ENL class to help them develop the language  and skills they need to be successful in college.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54        Additionally, our ENL and content area teachers offer tutoring sessions to ENL students both after school and during Saturday  school sessions.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      To assist our ENL students, we continue implementing the integrated co-taught class model in content areas with highest ENL  demands. Our ENL teachers collaborate and teach in various content area classes, such as History, English language arts and  Science. In addition, one of our ENL teachers will take on the teacher leadership role of a Model Teacher to support content  area teachers in delivering the highest quality of ENL instruction.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   NA     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ENLs in our school have equal opportunity in all programs. Our ENL students attend tutoring and other after- school  programs based on their language and subject area needs. We are an inclusive school supporting everyone. We have after- school tutoring, Saturday school and courses offered by our CBO, Liberty Partnership. ENL students are invited to, and often  participate in our annual talent show and International Night as well.  Furthermore, all invitations for programs and other school letters are translated into various languages before they are sent  out to parents.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Our ENL students have access to computers and laptops in classes and in the school’s media center. We use glossaries and the  Google Translate to assist in translations. Our ENL students are allowed to use electronic translators where appropriate in  classes as well.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We use native language as an aid through peer groups in subject and ENL classes. When feasible, we ask students with  language skills to assist fellow students who speak the same language. In addition, native language support is provided through  translations, bilingual glossaries and dictionaries.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   All services utilized have been identified as suitable for high school students. Reading materials are provided based on  students’ language level and cognitive ability. All resources have been reviewed by our ENL teachers to ensure that they are  effective, supportive, accessible, grade level appropriate and CCLS aligned.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    While we are a collocated school, we share our space with both a middle school and a charter school, making the sharing of  resources difficult.  As such, all services are provided by our staff to our students.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   At the beginning of the school year, we provide two days of Freshmen Orientation. All students, including ENLs, meet with  their teachers for one day to review course requirements and to get an opportunity to ask questions about the upcoming  school year. The following day, the students go on a trip to the New York Aquarium to conduct dissections and participate in a  guided “behind the scenes” tour.  To assist newly enrolled ENL students , we provide ENL Parent/Student orientation. At these meetings, the ENL teachers and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         Parent Coordinator facilitate these meetings to introduce the ENL student and his/her parents to the school system and to the  ENL program offered at our school. The parents are provided with the HLIS (Home Language Survey in parent's preferred  language) , ENL/Bilingual/Dual Language Parent orientation video in parent's preferred language, information brochures in  parent's preferred language and translations offered by our teaching staff who speak same language as parent or use of over- the-phone translation and interpretation unit. If students' are eligible for ENL they will take NYSITELL exam and afterwards  scores will be reported to parents in their along with Parent Selection forms in their preferred language.  We will also provide bi-monthly parent workshops/meetings offered to all ENL students. The workshops will be conducted by  Parent Coordinator and ENL teacher(s). The topics to be covered include: Parent orientation, How to help your child succeed in  school,  transcript and graduation requirements,  college and career night and Family/Cultural celebrations. These events will  begin in November 2017 and run until June 2018. Each monthly workshop will run for two hours each time in  the afternoon/evening sessions.    New ENL students arriving during the school year are introduced to their classmates and we try to find students with the same  home languages to serve as buddies as the students are acclimated to our school. In addition, our school is implementing a  senior mentoring program for all incoming Freshmen and mentors for ENL students will be selected based on common home  language.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We currently offer a three year sequence of Spanish as a foreign language course of study for all students, including ENLs.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  We provide professional development for our ENL teachers throughout the year. Both Ms. Horvath and Ms. Preda routinely  attend PD and information sessions to improve engagement skills and learn new instructional strategies. The two ENL teachers  disseminate information with the entire staff on a regular basis as they develop strategies for our ENL students. They conduct  workshops,which share best practices with content area teachers, such as Living Environment, History, English Language Arts  and Science teachers. They also co-plan with these teachers to create instruction that is tailored to meet the language needs of  all ENL students based on their ENL level (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding).  These strategies  help our ENL teachers to plan and deliver instruction that is aligned to CCLS in classes and in preparation for the NYSESLAT  exam.   In addition, both ENL teachers     2.

In addition, Ms. Horvath serves as a model ENL teacher for the entire school. She will deliver  monthly training to content area teachers to help them refien their curriculum to meet the needs of their ENL students. Also,  she will open up her class as a lab for all content area teachers to come and observe best practices/strategies for teaching ENL  students.    To support incoming students, we review their data from previous years on the ELA and Math State Exams as well as the  NYSESLAT and NYSITELL. We share this information with all teachers in order to more fully support our ENL population.    Professional development is scheduled as per the latest regulations to ensure compliance.  Services are provided in-house and  through staff developers and consultants.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In addition to our student/parent orientations and parent-teacher conferences, our ENL teachers have hosted ENL parent  nights to share important information and keep parents updated as to the curriculum and student progress. Furthermore,  teachers of ENLs keep parents informed about student progress via phone calls, e-mails. For phone calls, staff members utilize  the DOE Translation and Interpretation Services to aid communication with parents in their native language(s).    Throughout the year, teachers of ENL students (ENL teachers with Content area teachers and IEP teachers meet to discuss  student progress and update plans. Once a month, ENL teachers meet with IEP teachers to discuss progress of  ENL/IEP students and update accommodations or modifications, which then are communicated with parents in person or over  the phone.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   We provide all relevant notices in all languages available through the Translation/Interpretation Unit. We also conduct PTA  meetings and encourage parents/guardians of ENL students to attend. Parents of ENLs are encouraged to attend and  participate in the "Back to School Night" and "International Night".   We will also provide bi-monthly parent workshops/meetings offered to all ENL students. The workshops will be conducted by  Parent Coordinator and ENL teacher(s). The topics to be covered include: Parent orientation, How to help your child succeed in  school,  transcript and graduation requirements,  college and career night and Family/Cultural celebrations. These events will  begin in November 2017 and run until June 2018. Each monthly workshop will run for two hours each time in  the afternoon/evening sessions.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Edward Wilensky, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Rachel Carson High School                                                                              School DBN: 21K344  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

In order to provide accessible information to all parents across different languages we have instituted the  following protocols:   A. A database is created of all home languages spoken by our students.  B. We translate all important letters to parents through the translation unit prior to sending them home.   C. All parents that visit the school and require translation services are assisted either through our in house staff  teachers who speak the same language or through the interpretation unit over the phone.   D. Signs are posted in all available languages at our entrance and main office to advise parents of the availability  of the translation services.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      As new students arrive, we ascertain the parents preferred language. This information is entered into the DOE  database and a record is kept at the school. We run an RBIR report in ATS that highlights the parent's preferred  language. Parents visiting the school will easily note the signs posted indicating the availability of translation and  interpretation services. We always note the preferred language of a parent prior to contacting the home regarding  any school concerns and insure that we have an interpreter standing by to assist. Our Parent Coordinator maintains a  list of all parent’s preferred languages in our records and on our emergency contact cards.   When necessary, we will contact the interpretation unit or our DOE approved vendor and ask that they conference a  call to a parent using the preferred parental language.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive.
