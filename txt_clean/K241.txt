This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Vision    Section 4: CEP Overview      We celebrate diversity and strive to instill integrity, compassion and confidence in each child. We give each student  support and encouragement to become his or her own unique self.    Mission    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Our mission is to establish within every student the joy for the pursuit of academic knowledge and excellence, a love  for the performing and visual arts, good citizenship and high standards, and to provide an environment where every  student can rise to his or her highest self.                2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Demographic Data   P.S. 241 houses 477 students from grades Pre-K to 5. Our student population is comprised of children from Africa,  the Caribbean and Middle Eastern nations whose languages include Fulani, Haitian Creole, Arabic, French and  Spanish. Males represent 49% of the student body, while females account for fifty-one percent.       Narrative Description    P.S. 241 is located in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, amidst one of the most exciting cultural areas in New  York City. It is surrounded by the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens, the Brooklyn Museum of Arts, the main branch of the  Brooklyn Library, Prospect Park, and Lefferts Homestead. There are three neighboring schools: Prospect Heights, Clara  Barton H.S., and St. Francis de Sales School for the Deaf. A short walk away is Medgar Evers College. We are  functioning in what you might call an educational park.       P.S 241 provides many collaborative experiences for our children. Our partnership with the Brooklyn Botanic Garden  engages our students and staff in horticultural studies.    Through our collaboration with the Brooklyn Museum of Art, our children take guided tours with a museum educator  and explore various art subjects in depth.    Our collaboration with Young Audiences, Carnegie Hall, Ballet Tech and Behind the Book has brought the excitement  of the Arts to our students while combining it with our focus on literacy. Artists in residence work with our students to  produce art works connected to academic subjects.       P.S. 241 is now in its third year of participation in SEP Jr. (Software Engineering Program), a three year pilot program  which immerses students in coding, computer programming and robotics.       We will continue our association with Math consultant Christine King, who, in collaboration with the data team, has  been instrumental in identifying data trends In order to ensure conceptual understanding and build foundational  skills, this year we will continue to hold a "Math Bootcamp" with multiple purposes of developing content knowledge   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      and consistent pedagogical structures across grades, as well as immersing students in math exploration via games and  discussion. .       Learning Leaders, or trained parent volunteers, have become an integral part of P.S. 241. They work with teachers to  provide instructional support. Through their organization, four published authors visit the school to introduce the  children to the world of writing and publishing, resulting in published classroom books which are authored by our  students.       The following programs will remain in place for the 2018-2019 school year:      Partnership with Teacher's College will enable us to work with consultants in developing curriculum and   improving pedagogy, which will in turn help students become more skilled writers.      The Wonders Literacy Program, which supports students (including ELLs and SWD) in accessing complex text      through the use of games, multimedia and multicultural texts, will ensure that our students develop vital  skills.  I Ready, an evidence-based integrated learning program which personalizes student instruction based on a  diagnosis of individual learning needs, will allow teachers and paraprofessionals to provide Tiers 1, 2 and 3  intervention and monitor student growth in ELA and Mathematics         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our ELL and SWD populations remain at 7% and 8% respectively. Students in these subgroups must be met at their  current proficiency levels through the collaboration between general education, special education and ENL  teachers, and by means of specially designed instruction, make progress toward meeting Core Standards in ELA,  Math and Science.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, the school made progress in most of the Framework elements, i.e.  rigorous instruction, collaborative teachers, effective school leadership, strong family-community ties and trust. In  these areas, the percentage of positive responses at P.S. 241, per the School Survey, surpassed the district and  citywide averages. There were similar findings from the most recent Quality Review Report (2015-2016), where we  received a Well -Developed in four out of five indicators: rigorous curriculum, assessment, culture of high  expectations and professional collaborations. In the final category, teacher pedagogy, the school was rated Proficient       These results were made possible due to increased collaboration within and across grades. We have developed the  faculty's capacity to work together to improve instruction, hence teams of teachers have developed rigorous units of  study that are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. We continue to address the needs of individual or  groups of students through the creation of multiple entry points to lessons. In an effort to nurture and advance the  professional growth of teachers and staff to strengthen leadership skills, the development and delivery of professional  learning workshops were largely executed by faculty. For example, during the 2017-2018 school year, teachers and  paraprofessionals were engaged in book study groups and staff development around Growth Mindset activities, with  the goal of integrating personal academic behaviors into classroom culture.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         Overall, P.S. 241 has created an environment of shared leadership and high expectations where teachers engage in  such collaborative practices as participating in professional learning groups, designing rigorous curriculum and  coordinating instruction across grades, including the current practice of departmentalization which affords teachers  the opportunity to collaborate around Tier 2 intervention. As a result of these efforts, teachers have designed tasks  that are aligned with the standards and using Webb's DOK, developed questions that are tailored to students 'specific  needs. This, in turn,allowed them to be cognitively engaged, thereby extending learning and contributing to deeper  understanding of concepts. College and career readiness is therefore promoted for all students, including English  Language Learners and Students with Disabilities. Based on data from the 2017-2018 School Survey, 95% of parents  are satisfied with their children's education and with the overall quality of their child's teachers, 92% of teachers  agree that the school has well-defined learning expectations for all students, 90% of teachers say school leaders  communicate a clear vision for this school and set high standards for student learning, and 94% of teachers would  recommend our school to parents.       We have several challenges ahead of us, however.     Based on the 2017 - 2018 New York State Test, despite an increase of 6% in the number of SWDs who were   proficient in ELA, only 17% reached proficiency levels.     ELLs also saw an increase of 3% in ELA performance but only 8% were deemed proficient.    According to a 2017-2018 district-wide assessment and P.S 241's internal evaluations, the improvement of   writing across the curriculum remains a priority need.    According to our latest Quality Review Report, the only area in which we did not receive a rating of Well-developed  was in teacher pedagogy, indicating that although the school has articulated a set of beliefs about how students learn  and multiple entry points are provided for access to lessons, we must focus on school-wide consistency and  uniformity in providing supports and extensions into the curricula. To this end, teacher teams will adhere to the  current systems for collecting, analyzing and using data to set goals for individual students and small groups, as well  as monitor classroom practices and student progress. The addition of I-Ready will better enable teachers to address  students' specific needs.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 17K241   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   521   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Strengths :    The school incorporates the common core shifts in literacy and math in the standards -based curriculum maps to  provide students with a clear pathway for Common Core Learning Standards - based opportunities that raise student  achievement. Classroom teachers use various instructional strategies, such as direct instruction, peer assistance,  checks for prior knowledge, guided practice and modeling to meet the needs of their students. As stated in the 2015- 2016 Quality Review Report, P.S. 241's ongoing adjustments to the curriculum address the learning gaps of low  performing students,while ensuring rigor and coherence with multiple entry points via Universal Design for Learning.  In this area, we are 'well developed' in designing interesting and challenging curricula, as well as assessing what  students learn. In order to promote college and career readiness, the school has incorporated strategies such as close  reading and the inclusion of web-based reading and math programs.   According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, the school received a score of 4.18 out of 5, in the domain of  rigorous instruction. This overall score includes a 4.99 in both the, "interesting, challenging," and the, "how well the  school is assessing what students are learning" domains. This is an indication of how well the curriculum is aligned to  instructional shifts and content standards. Teachers have the resources and tools necessary for planning instruction  so that students may interact with academic language and complex text. Overall, teachers and parents feel that  administrators communicate high expectations for student’s success and 95% of parents feel that the school  effectively partners with families to support student success.   The school's 2017-2018 NYSED Report Card reflected an increase among all students who score proficient on the ELA  and Math assessments of 10% and 16%, respectively. With regard to the ELA, there was an increase of 9% who  achieved proficiency amongst black or African American students, and 19% for Hispanic or Latino students, as well as  a 10% increase in proficiency of economically disadvantaged children.    The state assessment results for mathematics were equally impressive. Overall, we saw a 16% gain over the previous  year of students achieving a proficient level on the state grade 3-8 mathematics assessment. This includes an 18%  gain amongst both black and African American, and Latino students, as well as a 16% gain for those who are  economically disadvantaged.   Needs:    Forty-eight percent of all students were below proficiency on the 2018 ELA State assessments. In spite of the  remarkable gains noted above there is much work to be done. Indeed, although 54% of all students achieved  proficiency in mathematics in 2018, 24% were still at level one and 21%, level two. Students With Disabilities saw an   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14      increase of only 4% proficiency but a simultaneous increase of level one students of 6% with 21% at level two. ENL  students saw drops of 24% and 9% of level one and two and while we also saw a rise of 4% ENL students proficient in  math, a full 64% were at level one and two (43% and 21% respectively).   The main focus of our progress monitoring will continue to be the F&P running records assessment given at the  beginning, and throughout the year. Currently based on data from last year, while we had 75% of students school- wide scoring at or above grade level in reading, 5% were only approaching grade level and 20% were below.    In order to increase performance in the above-mentioned content areas and subgroups, systematic intervention and  progress monitoring must be provided at the Tiers 1 and 2 levels to address how individual or groups of students,  including ELLs and SWD, access grade specific curriculum. Specifically, we will be targeting the 5 pillars of literacy,  including deficiencies in fluency, reading comprehension, and writing.       Our focus will be as follows:      Ensure research-based and uniformed instructional practices in accordance with the school’s belief system   (DARE {Danielson/Differentiation, Assessment/Accountable Talk, Rubric/Rigor, Encouragement/Expectation}),  the instructional shifts, Framework for Great Schools and best teaching practices, so students may produce  meaningful work products.     Consistency in teaching students how to build on each other’s ideas during class discussions and make   connections across content areas and to real world situations.      Establish and build on students’ foundational knowledge and skills for coherent progressions within the   standards from grade to grade.     The Wonders ELA program has been fully integrated across all grade levels so we will continue to develop  rigorous performance tasks and questions that are aligned with the CCLS, with a particular focus on the six  pillars of literacy development, especially as it pertains to ELLs and SWD. The program has a strong digital  component which uses data from diagnostic assessments to design targeted intervention     Examine proficiency levels for ELLs and integrate strategies for addressing their needs at each stage of   language development     Continue to refine our progress monitoring tool through frequent data analysis and mid-point assessments.         Focus on Individual or group of students using benchmark assessments.  Increase the number of SWD meeting IEP goals  Since rosters have been realigned so that all ENL students per grade now reside in the same class, the ENL  teacher will more effectively work with those classroom teachers in a co-teaching inclusive setting allowing  for additional scaffolding through true differentiation. The SETSS teacher will also be co-teaching with  teachers of SWD in particular classes.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.      By June, 2019, through an increased focus on data-driven differentiated instruction in literacy, 50% of all students  (includingi ELLs and SWD) will progress by 2 or more reading levels ,as measured by Fountas & Pinnell Reading   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15      Benchmark assessments and 20% of all students will perform at Tiers 3 or 4 on the CCLS ELA Benchmark Series and/or  Levels 2 to 3 in TC Writing samples.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

We have maintained a culture of mutual  trust, high expectations and positive attitudes that support students’ academic and personal growth   Structures remain in place to facilitate a positive learning environment, inclusive culture, and student success. Our  school coordinates social emotional learning, attendance, and youth development to promote academic success. As  attested by 86% of teachers, adults at P.S.241 teach students the skills they need to regulate their behavior (by  focusing their attention, controlling their emotions, or managing their thinking, behavior, and feelings).   As indicated in the School Quality Guide, a score of 3.80 (1 to 4 percent above district and citywide performance)  supports our conclusion that the majority of students are safe within and outside of the school. The 2017-2018 School  Survey Report and the School Quality Guide also report that 97% of families say their child is safe at school, while 94%  of families say the school will make them aware if there are any emotional or psychological issues affecting their  child's academic performance.    Needs:    Although findings reveal proficiency in this framework element, there is room for improvement. According to the  2017-2018 OORS Report, there was an increase in overall incidents, particularly in Level 4 and 5 infractions. Based on  the most recent School Survey Report (2017-2018), 45% of teachers say that students do not behave well in class. In  keeping with the district's goal of developing systems to support students' social and emotional development,  teachers and support staff will be provided the necessary training and supports, via RULER and Sanford Harmony to  directly teach social emotional skills, as well as recognize how their own emotions impact instruction.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Strengths:    The 2015-2016 Quality Review Report has indicated, through a rating of 'well developed,that the vast amount of  teachers are engaged in constructive collaborations to improve teacher practice and increase student achievement.  School leaders schedule weekly teacher instructional and inquiry team meetings that specifically analyze student work  and address their individual learning needs. In addition to Tuesday afternoon teacher team meetings, all classroom  teachers have at least one common preparation period that is used for lesson planning, analysis of data and their own  professional development activities. All teachers are actively engaged in scheduled, structured teacher team  activities, using specific protocols to deepen their understanding of content and the Common Core Learning  Standards and to develop grade-wide pedagogical strategies.   Of the teachers who were surveyed during the 2018-2019 school year, 98% of teachers report satisfaction with peer  collaboration, including opportunities to work productively with colleagues at professional development and design  instructional programs together.    Distributed leadership practices are in place so that teachers build capacity and have a voice in key decisions that  affect student learning. For example, 96% of teachers agree that they are given opportunities to work with  administrators and staff to make the school run effectively.       Needs:   Internal evaluation as well as data from the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide indicate a need for innovation. Only 52%  of teachers say that their colleagues are eager to try new ideas; 21% do not believe teachers are actively trying to  improve their teaching and 21% maintain that teachers should take more responsibility for improving the school.   This year, teachers, including Music and Science clusters, will have opportunities for inter-visitation with other  schools. For instance, teachers will look at those schools who have already implemented the Teacher's College Writing  Program. In our third year of the STEM Program, teachers will also continue to visit showcase schools to adopt best  practices. Additionally, classroom teachers will collaborate with the Arts in Schools teacher to integrate the visual arts  across all content areas.

Strengths:    School leaders have consistently nurtured the leadership development of teachers and educational assistants through  mentoring programs and professional development. The Danielson’s Framework is also used to implement strategies  that promote professional growth and reflection.    Based on the School Quality Guide of the 2018- 2019 school year, P.S. 241 received top marks for inclusive leadership.  Principals regularly involve teachers and special education service providers in hiring decisions, workshop initiatives,  and selection of instructional materials used in classrooms. Ninety-five percent of parents report that school leaders  encourage feedback from them and the community through regular meetings. Similarly, 95% of parents credit the  school leaders with creating a sense of community, promoting family and community involvement and shared  decision-making.   Another area of strength is instructional leadership. One hundred percent of teachers indicated that the school  leadership set high standards for student learning and that the expectations for meeting instructional goals are clear.  Ninety-seven percent also say school leaders set clear expectations for teachers about implementing what they have  learned in professional development and encourage feedback through regular meetings with parents/ teacher  leaders. The majority of teachers are pleased with administrators' involvement in their classrooms and the tracking of  student academic progress.   Needs:    District-wide assessment data indicate a need to ensure quality instruction is taking place in all classrooms. Our own  Internal observations also revealed a need for structured use of diagnostic tools and targeted instruction to support  student mastery. We must continue to develop the collaboration between teachers and paraprofessionals in the use  of diagnostic tools and targeted instruction so we may improve performance for student subgroups, including ELLs  and SWD.   Our focus this year is to create the conditions for teachers to effectively work together to identify common challenges  and evaluate instructional approaches. Much of our human resources, as evidenced by new prep schedules and  reorganization of special populations, will be directed towards departmentalization, as well as providing time for  planning, studying content and instructional support via Grade leaders, paraprofessionals,Title I experts, ENL and  Special Education teachers.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Strengths:    Per the 2015-2016 Quality Review measures, P.S. 241 was given a score of 4.99 out of 5 for effective partnerships with  families in support of student success. We are noted for our family and community involvement. The Learning Leaders  Program is one of the largest in the city with more than 36 parents trained every year to assist in classrooms and the  cafeteria. Teachers communicate regularly with parents through progress reports, conferences, telephone calls and  IEP/School Implementation Team meetings about how they can help their children learn. Parents are also invited to  visit classrooms and observe the instructional programs. The Parent Coordinator conducts parent workshops several  times per year and holds award ceremonies in celebration of parent contribution to the school.    According to the 2018-2019 School Quality Guide, 95% of parents say the school communicates with them in a  language and manner that they can understand, and praise staff for greeting them warmly when they call or visit.    Ninety-five percent of parents who responded to the survey expressed satisfaction with the education their child is  receiving, with overall family involvement and shared decision-making. Ninety-one percent are pleased with the way  teachers work closely with them to meet the needs of their children and ninety-seven percent agreed that school  leaders encourage feedback from parents through regular meetings with parent and teacher leaders.   Needs:    A review of parents’ attendance data reveals a decline in parental participation. More than one fourth of parents have  not attended parent teacher conferences and according to the School Quality Guide, . Of those who responded, 26%  reported they had not been asked or given the opportunity to volunteer time to support the school.    The prevailing thought among educators and researchers is that parental involvement is an integral part of student  success, which is why P.S. 241 has always had strong partnerships with parents. The above-mentioned areas of  challenge highlights the need for greater and more effective parental support for curriculum and school-wide  initiatives. To this end, we will increase outreach efforts to increase participation and accommodate parents by  varying meeting times.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 241, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       Emma Johnston Elementary School (PS241) will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before October 30 of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

At PS 241 we are committed to providing our English Language Learners with a  thorough and efficient education while being aware of the challenges these students face in social  and academic settings.  We recognize that becoming proficient in English is a process.  The skills  acquired over time are influenced by many aspects in life.  Our ENL and newcomer students require intensive remedial intervention in basic skills many of  our other students take for granted.  They need to be in a small supportive environment where  they can practice these skills without the fear of embarrassment while given the time they  require.  At PS 241 we strive to meet the needs of each child through level and age-appropriate second  language instruction with cultural awareness..  Description of Program:  ENL Students are arranged in groups consisting of contiguous grades, 2-3 and 3-4, after school  on Wednesday and Thursdays for two hours per day.  The session wil be divided into two fifty  minute periods, one focusing on math and the other on literacy.  Students will use the i-Ready  program and Imagine Learning under teacher guidance to address needs identified by in program  diagnostic testing with differentiated instruction.  Students will be sub grouped according to  individual need in each subject area for intensive skill and study in a supportive and nurturing  environment. More advanced students are invited to participate and will be given opportunities  for advanced study with teacher guidance. The focus will be on Teachers College writing  projects and supplemental math study to provide differentiated focus on our higher performing  ENL students.  The Title III Program is an After-School Program designed to provide specific and appropriate  language training for English Language Learners.   The program consists of one class with 25  students.   The teacher of the Title III After-School program has been trained in  ESL Methodologies, is English as Teaching of English to Students of Other Languages with an  English Language Arts (ELA) extension.  Students will be provided with instruction in Language Development, Math, Literacy, Writing,  and Technology.  The program will be in operation on Wednesdays and Thursdays, from 2:30 to  4:30 p.m. for 22 sessions.       The findings of a comprehensive needs assessment resulted in the identification of students  for the Title III After-School Program.  Students were selected based on assessment data,  including teacher observation, portfolios, Fountas & Pinnell Reading Assessment,  2016 NYSESLAT, ELA and Math tests.  Students in grades 3, 4, and 5, who were most at risk in  Language Development and who will take the 2017 New York state ELA and Math tests, are  given priority.       Several key factors were identified for the improvement of student performance.  These are:  school-wide implementation of effective strategies to address the needs of students lacking the  basic skills in both Reading and Mathematics;   intensive professional development for teachers  in specialized strategies to meet the needs of special populations. From the findings of this   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   comprehensive data analysis, it has been decided that the ELLs would participate in the  supplementary programs: Language Arts, Writing, Mathematics, and Computer Science.

Consultation is also made to ensure we are ENL aware for all PD at PS 241.  We are also developing plans with the Field Support Office to present Advanced Literacy to our  entire staff. This approach to vocabulary across content areas will provide us with a better  framework for coherent planning and curriculum development. We will begin by bringing in our  ENL PD liaison to introduce Advanced Literacy (AL) to our administrative cabinet. We have  also sent our ENL teacher to the first AL workshop and are in the process of sending our  Literacy Support/Testing Coordinator to the second AL workshop.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

We plan to provide three parent workshops in math for parents through CITE. These programs  were very successful last year in reducing parent anxiety in providing homework help and  becoming more involved with the challenges their students face. We also intend to provide one  workshop to address bullying online so that parents can exert more control over their child's  online/social media presence. These programs will begin in January and will run through April  on selected school nights, the schedule to be worked out with our PTA team.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school will use a number of assessment tools to assess the early literacy skills of our ELL population.  They are: Fountas &  Pinnell Running Records, DIBELS (Dynamic Indicators of Early Literacy Skills), and Treasure Chest. The data from these  assessments give us specific information in regard to the needs of individual students as it pertains to phonemic awareness,  phonetic development, vocabulary development, narrative skills and fluency.  This information will inform instructional  focus,differentiation of lessons, and type of intervention.  Data results indicate that 56% of first graders and 57% of  kindergarten students are performing at entering levels.  Consequently, our focus will be on developing early literacy skills for  these grades and for students in other grades who fall within this category.  From second through fifth grade, the majority of  students are at the expanding level, so the implication for teachers is that they provide opportunities for students to interpret  tables, pictures, and charts to effectively participate in discussions.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   For assessment initiatives to be effective and ongoing, our assessment calendars details the schedule in which  baseline and  periodic assessments are administered.  Time is structured in teacher programs to administer, score, and analyse data from  assessment results.  Teachers have access to assessment materials (assessment kits, testing materials, and technology).     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The effectiveness of our program will be evaluated through one or more of the following:  --NYSESLAT results ( Number of students who have made 1 year progress)  --New York State ELA and Math standardized test results (Number of students who have made 1 year progress.  -- Pre and Post test results for grades K-3(Number of students who moved at least 1 level in a year)  --Fountas & Pinnell Reading Running Records (Number of students who have moved 3 reading levels in one year  --State Science test results (Number of students who have made 1 year progress )  --Teacher Teams’ analysis of students’ work/Teacher Effectiveness      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Tier 1 is the instructional core that is intended to incorporate high quality evidence-based instruction for all students. This  includes instruction that has been shown to be effective for ELLs, and differentiation to meet students’ diverse needs.  Instruction for ELLs in English language development is provided at the Tier 1 instructional level after we have identified  characteristics of ELL students as children and learners.   Students move into Tier 2 and Tier 3 if, based on baseline or interim  assessments, they demonstrate a need for more targeted and intensive academic support.  This extra support can occur in the  classroom, but also in separate settings with instruction focused on specific learning targets .      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The Spring NYSESLAT results show that there are more students at the beginning level in grades K-2.  Historically, our school  has registered a greater number of early grade students who are new to the country.  So this accounts for the high number of  students at the beginning level. There is also a greater number of students performing at the expanding or advanced  level.  This number reflects the growth achieved as students become more immersed in the target language.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The students are placed in age/grade appropriate educational setting,giving consideration to all placement criteria  and adequate support to gain English Language proficiency as well as access to core content and all programs,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73         services and extra-curricular activities. Standard based literacy instruction is provided in English for the ENL Push - in/Pull-out program, following the Language Allocation distribution.    English will be the language of instruction in the program. The students are heterogeneously grouped within each  grade. All students receive instructions in general education or Integrated Co-teaching classrooms, in which cluster  teachers are deployed to enrich the curriculum. Instruction will be developed around real life, meaningful and  purposeful experiences. All of the lesson activities will be based on strategies that have been proven successful with  English Language Learners.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A     c.  DL program.

How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                Based on the students’ NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT scores and in accordance with CR Part 154, students at the entering  and                       emerging levels receive 360 minutes of ESL instruction weekly. Students at the transitioning and expanding levels  receive                        180 minutes of instruction. Students at the commanding (proficient) level continue to receive services for an  additional two years.                                                                                                                         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.        Analyzing the data from the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT, the school will make informed decisions on content area  instruction, taking into account  the language acquisition and development. The data reveal that our ELLs across the grades  perform poorly in writing. Therefore, thematic units of instruction will be planned to meet the performance standards for each  grade level. These units will provide differentiated instructions to group of students by level of language fluency and academic  proficiency in the content area. Instructional units will be designed to meet the Common Core Learning Standards for each  grade level while attending to the needs of our ELL students. Classroom teachers of ELLs, Title I, SETTS, ENL and cluster  teachers will collaborate to apply best practices (e.g. cooperative learning, think-pair-share, visuals, scaffolding, Picture  Inductive Model, the Total Physical Response, the carousel walk, and hands-on projects) in the delivery of instruction and  ultimately elevating the levels of students’ performance in standard based assessments.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?        N/A       5.

The instructional plan for ELLs who have been in the US schools for less than three years will be as follows:         1. Intensive English development instruction teaching social studies and academic language in small group settings         2. Extended 50 minute block small grouping         3. Title III After-School program         4. Individual tutoring         5. Language development         6. Cooperative learning         7.Integrated cultural activities         8. Recognition of students’ native language     6c. The plan for ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years is as follows:         The ENL teacher as well as the classroom teachers will follow the Children’s Initiative Curriculum using balanced literacy          program which consists of:        1.Independent/paired reading, shared reading, guided reading, literacy centers, literature circles, writer’s workshop,  interactive           read aloud and vocabulary word study.        2. Cooperative learning        3. Title III After-School program        4. Integrated cultural activities        5. Recognition of students’ native language     6d. The The plan for Long Term ELLs is as follows:   The Language Proficiency Team will examine:  --The quality of the core instruction  – The quality of the relationship between teacher and  students  – How ELL students are supported within the  classroom  – Quality of interest and motivation  – How we measure the students' opportunities  to learn  - The possibility that the student may need additional intervention by consulting with the Committee on Special Education  (CSE) if the student is a student with a disability or is suspected of having a disability that may impact the ability to speak, read,  write or listen in English.      6e. Former ELLs will receive .5 unit of study per week or 90 minutes of instruction per week per year.       two years.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?          Some common academic  intervention options are as follows:       1. Re-wording the text of the reading assignment in simple phrases       2. Writing hints or reminders in the text       3. Using real life experiences when discussing the reading material       4. Having the work or tests read orally (if indicated on IEP)       5. Pairing ELL students with other ELL students or general education peers   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75           6. Using a tape recorder to play books on tape       7. Provide visuals to support academic work       8. Break work into smaller pieces       9. Explicitly teach study skills/habits, as well as effective ways of using educational resources and materials      10. Provide native language to students in the classroom      11. Provide more time to finish assignments  The instructional plan includes a variety of strategies such as note taking, brainstorming, visuals, hands-on activities, concept  poster,   vocabulary word chart, music, poetry, role-play, Total Physical Response, activating prior knowledge, graphic organizer, Think- Pair- Share, and cooperative learning group, and online learning such as Imagine Learning, ST Math and Tumble Books, etc.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?    Curricular and academic tasks are planned and refined using student work and data so that these students receive the  modifications and supports needed to access the curricula.  Across the majority of classrooms, teaching strategies (including  questioning, cooperative group learning, visuals, graphic organizers and think-pair-share) provide multiple entry points which  allow  ELLs - SWDs to engage in challenging tasks.  Our flexibility in scheduling allow students access to interventions and  ,supplemental programs provided during and after school, as well as weekends.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.    ELA--The programs targeting our  ELLs in ELA is Treasure Chest, which supports all aspects of language acquisition; Imagine  Learning, an on-line program which offers instruction in several languages, and Engage NY, the school-wide program.  Math--The Go Math program which is used throughout the school, bolsters students’ understanding through a highly  interactive learning environment that presents even the most abstract concepts with ease. The program is presented to  students in the context of real -world examples. ELL students are able to develop fluency in critical skills, math reasoning,  conceptual understanding and problem solving skills.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?        We will continue to use technology as an innovative teaching tool in our program.  We will also improve progress monitoring  as it pertains to the RTI process for ELLs.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.    ELL students have access to all programs in our school, especially the Title III which provides high quality supplemental  instructions to this target group. ELLs scoring at the Beginning and Intermediate levels in ESL proficiency are given priority in  this program. Our primary goal in this program is to further develop their language acquisition skills in all the four modalities:  listening, speaking, reading, and writing. In addition to their participation in the Saturday Academy, our ELL students are  actively involved in the performing Arts.  As members of the Music Department’s Bell Ensemble and the Vocal Choir, they  perform at Carnegie Hall once a year.  Under the direction of our Assistant Principal, they participate annually in the P.S. 241  School Holiday Spectacular Show. All of the ELLs take part in Young Audience, a Performing Arts program in which professional  artists perform for our students.     Our soccer team, comprised largely of ELL students, won the Sports and Arts Foundation Soccer Tournament for ELementary  Schools.  Finally, the ELLs are also very active in student government.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.    The instuctional materials being used support the modalities of language acquisition - listening, speaking, reading and writing.  In our ENL program, we will use leveled readers and culturally relevant materials to accelerate the learning process. Our ENL  teacher will use a variety of literary genre and resources to enhance language acquisition.  For instance, our ELLs will have  access to Imagine Learning, a literacy-based online program, Treasure Chest which is a differentiated reading program, Options  Language for Learning, a Content Vocabulary-Based program, Comprehensive Reading Assessment, Engage New York and Go  Math.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?     To support the native language in our ENL program, ELL students are allowed to communicate in their home language with  their peers in class and anywhere in the school environment. Bilingual dictionaries as well as other cultural relevant materials  are available in the ENL classroom. The ENL teacher uses cognates with Beginning level students. Finally, some classroom  teachers adapt the Buddy system- pairing an English speaking with a non-English speaking student.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.      The students are placed in age and grade appropriate educational setting giving consideration to all placement criteria and  adequate support to gain English proficiency, as well as access to core content and all programs, services and extra-curricular  activities. Standard-based literacy instruction is provided in English for the ENL pull-out program.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?      The instuctional materials being used support the modalities of language acquisition - listening, speaking, reading and writing.  In our ENL program, we will use leveled readers and culturally relevant materials to accelerate the learning process. Our ENL  teacher will use a variety of literary genre and resources to enhance language acquisition.  For instance, our ELLs will have  access to Imagine Learning, a literacy-based online program, Treasure Chest which is a differentiated reading program, Options  Language for Learning, a Content Vocabulary-Based program, Comprehensive Reading Assessment, Engage New York and Go  Math.        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).     Our school provides an intensive English development to newly enrolled ELL students:  -Instructional planning integrates all four basic English skills-listening, speaking, reading and writing  -Extended 50 minute block small grouping  -Provide training in ESL techniques to classroom teachers  -Articulation between ENL and classroom teachers  -Title III After -School program  -Integrated cultural activities  -Recognition of students’ native language        17.

They regularly attend orientation,      PTA meetings, Parent teacher conferences, Assemblies, assist classroom teachers on educational trips, support      our fundraising and provide volunteer services in the lunchroom and other areas as needed. To support the efforts      on the part of the parents, our Parent Coordinator maintains constant communication with them. She schedules      and encourages the ELL parents to attend workshops to become Certified Learning Leaders, nutrition, parenting       classes, technology, the Title I in which Cluster and Funded teachers present their programs at the beginning of      the school year. In addition, the Parent Coordinator helps to update materials focusing on the various curricula, and      parents of ELLs receiving school related materials in English and in the other languages.         Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.     The school policy emphasizes the literacy and learning standards with high expectations for all children. It stresses assessment  driven planning and instruction. The P.S. 241 Plan desires to accelerate our students’ acculturation through the Title III program  and the Saturday Academy. Our LAP accepts the challenge of meeting the diverse needs of our ELLs so that they can rise to their  highest potential. We seek to establish in every student a lifelong love for learning. The goal of our LAP is to equip our English  Language Learners with the academic, social, and technological skills that will enable them to become productive members of  society.                                      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Using the information gathered  from the language survey and parent interviews, the school determines individual written translation and oral  interpretation needs to ensure that all family members of the school community are provided with appropriate  and timely information in a language that they can understand. There is a bilingual (French/Haitian) ESL teacher  who provides translation support, as necessary for our Haitian and African students and parents. The Principal and  Assistant Principal also provide translation support (Haitian Creole/French and Spanish) to families throughout the  school year. In addition, there are several school aides and teachers who help facilitate communication   with parents and family members who require translation or clarification.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          83     2.
