This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      PS 3 / The Bedford Village School is the oldest public school in continuing and contiguous existence in New York City.  Since the early 1700s, there has been a schoolhouse in Bedford, a farming hamlet and crossroads settled by Dutch  families. Photos of earlier buildings include a one-room school, which the Brooklyn Public Library claimed as home of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      the first public library in Brooklyn during its own Centennial commemoration in 1992. The Bedford Village School  continues to be the cornerstone of this historic, Bedford-Stuyvesant brownstone neighborhood.    This is our mission statement:    We, the staff and parents, envision P.S. 3 / The Bedford Village School as a stimulating learning center:    ● in which all children are leaders;    ● where parents and teachers work together and address the academic and social needs of our children in the school  and community;    ● where children will achieve an enriched, integrated curriculum that responds to the diverse cultural heritage of our  children;    ● in which independent study and critical thinking skills are nurtured;    ● in which citizenship is promoted and enhanced;    ● and, where a love for learning is perpetuated.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   We are a Pre-Kindergarten to fifth grade School-Wide Projects, Comer, Sanford Harmony and the Leader in Me School  with committed stakeholders, progressive leadership and instruction, community partnerships and support. student  academic achievement through projects and takes place in a standards-based core curriculum integrated with the  Arts, Technology and Physical Education. We have an active School Leadership Team involved in school management  and on-going comprehensive educational planning.    Our curriculum is New York State Standards-based, which is aligned to Common Core Learning Standards. We believe  that learning is actively constructed, is concrete and abstract, is socially mediated, emerges from building on  experiences, is influenced by culture and the context in which it occurs, and involves growth and development. We  use formative assessments to adjust and differentiate instruction. We believe in arts-integrated curriculum and field  trips to support content area teaching and learning.    We have a long-standing commitment to arts education as an essential component in our core instructional program.  Not only do we fund full-time arts teachers in 3 out of the four arts strands as per the Blueprint for Learning and  Teaching in the Arts ( visual arts, music and theater), but partnerships with arts-in-education organizations that  provide opportunities for our students to participate in all of the strands. Our students experience exhibitions,  concerts and performances in various venues around the city. Through a federally funded initiative, our theater  teacher acquired knowledge and skills in theater education. Our arts-in-education partners’ teaching artists model  arts lessons connected to ELA and Math curriculum, which classroom teachers observe. The Shadowbox Theatre, a  musical theater company that uses our auditorium as its home base, has received, for the sixth year, a New York State  Council for the Arts grant to implement literacy-based puppetry workshops with many of our classes. This is a form of  professional development, which enables classroom teachers to learn how to integrate strands of arts education into  their classroom instruction in all subject areas and provides opportunities for our SWDs and ENLs to interact with  their other classmates on a level playing field that is fun. We have weekly school wide meetings, that we refer to as  our Town Hall. During these meetings, classes take turns performing. This gives all students performing arts  experiences and teachers opportunities to implement arts instruction, while enabling the school to experience  community, cohesion and celebration of every one's talents. This year our arts-in-education providers are the 92 nd  Street Y, the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts Museum (MoCADA), and Forces of Nature Dance   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Theater Company. Our grade 3-5 classes attend an annual Black History month concert at Town Hall and two  Orchestra of St. Luke's concerts. Our PreK-2nd grade classes attend several musical puppetry performances by The  Shadowbox Theatre. Many of our students matriculate to schools that allow them to extend their participation in the  arts; some go on to arts-related careers. We have received support from the French Consulate and other established  DLPs around New York City.    Our teachers have an average of 22 years of teaching experience. They are engaged in on-going professional  development. We continue to develop teacher pedagogy to include effective questioning, discussion, and  differentiation techniques that result in multiple entry points so that all students are consistently engaged in learning  and discussion. We analyze assessment data to inform instruction and support specific goals for all learners. Teachers  share effective practices and activities. Inquiry teams plan next steps using what is successful and discarding what is  not. During Lunch-and-Learn sessions, grade-level common preps, and Monday PD sessions teachers meet  collaboratively for planning and evaluation. Protocols are in place for the documentation of work. Student work, as  well as teacher practice, is analyzed to maximize the effectiveness of instruction. Attributes of effective readers and  writers are documented in annotated conference notes, which are analyzed for strengths and weakness that also  enable differentiation and drive instruction. The checklist for rigor of instruction will also be used as a springboard for  discussions. Collaborative planning is aligned to the Common Core and involves depth of knowledge strategies, critical  thinking, and self-reflection. Conference notes in different subject areas and the exchange of feedback in student  notebooks and journals are evidence in this practice.    Administrators ensure effective, consistent and differentiated instruction across grade levels and throughout the  school. Formal and informal observations are followed by conversations and written feedback in which positivity  comes first and next steps are determined. From this, lab sites, inter-visitations and other professional development  activities are scheduled. This is a cyclical process. Administrators return for follow-up visits to ensure that agreed  upon revisions are implemented.      We are engaged in a school-wide transformative leadership process that is establishing a guiding vision, common  language, and culture within the school community. It builds mutual trust and positive growth of students and adults  and establishes a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students and families and  positively impacts the quality for the instructional core across classrooms. Through The Leader in Me process and the  Sanford Harmony program, students learn leadership, accountability, adaptability, initiative and self-direction, cross  cultural skills, responsibility, problem solving, communication, creativity and teamwork. The Sanford Harmony  Program is our partner for professional development and materials to help us address the social-emotional health and  development and success of our students.      Over the past few years we received numerous Grow to Learn NYC grants to develop our school garden as a  classroom. We received a Citizens Committee for New York City grant to plant our sidewalk gardens with native  species understory woodland plants, shrubs and trees. We are continuing our Education for Sustainability initiatives,  which began three years ago in partnership with the Children’s Environmental Literacy Foundation. We won a $5,000  award for reducing our electricity usage from Solar One’s Green Design Lab for two consecutive years.   We automated our library through a Department of School Library Services grant, and are a MYLibraryNYC member,  and participate in the Brooklyn Public Library’s Meet-the-Author Series .   Our after school programs are varied and inclusive: Reading Partners, CAMBA, MoCADA, Music Ensemble, Art Club,  and a Title III Supplemental Instruction Program for ENLs. The Digital Girls Inc. developed partnership to work with  students from grades 4.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Since 1990, we have been on the forefront of educational reform in New York City. Our initial efforts were sponsored  by the Department of Education’s Office of School Reform and supported by the United Federation of Teachers. We  were awarded grants from the DeWitt-Wallace/Readers’ Digest Fund for Library/Media Center enhancement and the  Annenberg Challenge for Arts Education for arts development. We have since received numerous New York City  Council grants for the improvement of Science and Technology instruction. NYC’s Department of Health operates an  in-school Medical Clinic.. We have an active PTA that promotes home-school communications, parental involvement,  and school development.    A review of our Learning Environment Survey indicated that parents wanted to use technology as a form of  communication. We have established a website to foster parent engagement. On the website we post notices, events  and our monthly newsletter. Teachers create web pages attached to our school website where they post homework  assignments and class news, announcements and photos. Teachers use Class Dojo to communicate with parents on a  daily basis. We sponsor monthly parent workshops regarding curricula, social/emotional development, and other  issues of interest to parents. Tuesday afternoon parent meetings have enabled us to communicate more effectively  and regularly regarding their child’s progress. They are encouraged to access the NYC Schools Account, and other  online resources to support their child’s learning at home. Our ENL teacher schedules regular meetings with parents  of our ENLs.           3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.     Regular education, SWD, ENL and students are engaged in the same grade-level curriculum. Using meta-  cognitive skills, students are taught to articulate their competencies in all academic subjects and are able to  bridge the unknown to the known. We believe that teaching and learning are social acts during which  students and teachers collaborate. We seek to instill in our students a love for learning and expectations that  they will be life-long learners, productive members of society, and good citizens. SWDs are in ICT classes or  self-contained classes. Those SWDs in regular education classes get Academic Intervention services. We also  have a Speech clinician, Adaptive Physical education and Physical and Occupational therapists. ENLs receive  mandated services from an ENL teacher. The children who are currently in domestic shelters will be provided  with additional social emotional support to help with anger and displacement issues.The guidance counselor  along with outside agencies will provide the support. The staff will be trained on strategies to help children  who are on the spectrum.   4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   In our 2017-2018 Principal's Performance Review we were rated Proficient in implementation Rigorous Instruction, as  per the Framework for Great Schools, and its assessments which inform instructional decisions. We were also rated  Proficient in Supportive Environment and Collaborative Teachers    Our challenges:    ● We need to show growth in learning in all subject areas as evidenced by the number of students who have scored  on or above grade level on City and State assessments and MOSLs. There were 7 teachers receiving overall rating of  Developing and 2 received Ineffective. Therefore presenting a need to focus on writing across the school.   ●We need to develop teacher pedagogy aligned to the curricula, engaging and meeting the needs of all learners so  that they produce meaningful work products.    ●We need to focus more on the social emotional developmental health of students.   ●We need to increase parental involvement to better support students at home.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12                     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 13K003   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   386   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  When recruiting highly qualified teachers we assemble a team of administrators, teachers and parents to interview  prospective candidates and evaluate their demonstration lessons based upon presentation, content, motivation,  student engagement and effective instruction based on evidence of student learning. The school environment  supports teacher satisfaction. Professional learning communities engage teachers in collaborative and sharing groups  in examining student work to impact instruction and student achievement. Teacher assignments are based on  expertise. While we honor the teacher union contract, there is a collaborative decision to promote teacher leaders  who attend leadership programs and workshops that they turnkey with their colleagues.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Staff attendance at continuing education and professional development workshops is encouraged. Selected staff are  assigned to various professional development sessions with the expectation that their knowledge will then be shared  with the rest of the school during common preps, inquiry team meetings and after school Mondays. Relevant  webinars and videos are utilized. Professional development will focus on the implementation of the CCSS and will  promote best practices, in designing units of study, lesson plans and tasks that include scaffolds, and instruction that  is rigorous, differentiated and cognitively engaging to address the diverse needs of all students and subgroups.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  For our PreK classes, In order to assist in the transition from PreK to Kindergarten, we implement the city-generated  curriculum which integrates ELA, Math, Social Studies and Science. We schedule vertical conversations between PreK  and Kindergarten teachers focusing on how students learn and their growth and progress. PreK students visit  Kindergarten classes. The conversation includes how ELLs and SWDs are prepared for Kindergarten. We sponsor Open  Houses for parents of preschool children from local early childhood programs. Administrators and Teachers provide  outreach to these programs. Their students also visit our Kindergarten classes. Parent workshops will be scheduled on  a regular basis using Sanford Harmony strategies. These strategies are implemented in the classroom as well. Sanford  Harmony is a structured program that addresses social/emotional needs of our students. This is a school-wide  initiative that encompasses grades Pre-K through 5.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     As a result of discussion at inquiry and grade meetings, decisions are made regarding the use and selection of  appropriate assessment measures and the professional development needed to ensure the use of assessment results.  These new assessments reflect the rigor aligned to the CCSS. Before we distribute the new assessments all teachers  attended professional development to review their content, the method of evaluation, the requirements, and the  rubrics used.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36        Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 13K003, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       P. S. 3K will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Research indicates that  native language art development accelerates the literacy gains in both the native language and  English, validates the prior knowledge students bring, and bolsters self-esteem.  In order to  capitalize on this resource, we are providing our English learners with books in their native  languages, bilingual glossaries and dictionaries, buddy systems, and technology enhancements,  such as CDs and DVDs. Some of these bilingual resource materials are also being made  available to parents to facilitate the student/families’ adaptation and to provide them with the  skills and knowledge to become active participants at work and in their children’s school.  Various sociological studies have indicated that culturally sensitive practices reduce the level of  anxiety in newcomers and contribute to accelerate language acquisition. In order to maximize  learning opportunities for our students, we strive to use practices such as dance, songs, and  performing arts that appeal to them.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our ELLs are assessed periodically with their mainstream classmates. We use FOUNTAS and PINELL, STARS,  MOSL, and  Wonders CCLS-aligned Reading Program. They also get Periodic Assessments designed specifically to measure their progress in  English language acquisition, particularly as it pertains to reading and writing. But above all, teachers design assessments that  are authentic and mirror reading and writing in the real world and in school. This objective is achieved through systematic  observation and documentation of progress; formal assessment which provides a snapshot view; informal assessment such as  student work samples and conferences with students and parents. The overall assessment is the New York State English as a  Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT), which is administered in the spring and ascertains every ELL's language  proficiency level for the following academic year. The date acquired help teachers modify their instructional plans to meet the  students' needs.  Tests data will be provided below.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      -Increased exposure to print and language. This access to books,reference materials,labels,posters and student work on  bulletin boards.  -Relationships between his own native language and English. Translanguage instruction.  -mainstream classroom teachers practice simplified language to engage ELLs ,in addition to using a variety of visual aids.  -Students are given frequent opportunities to work together in pairs or small groups.  -Teachers implement a feedback policy.  -Visual aids like pictures ,videos and graphic novels.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   Observations, formal or informal, conferences, students' work   and test scores , parents' feedback and professional  development meetings,  all these and more can help evaluate the success of the programs we are following and implementing  .The ELLs who took the state tests in ELA  this year 2015-2016  achieved very high results. 7uccess rates  are:  100% in third  grade, 57% in fourth grade, and 67% in fifth grade. The result can improve more when we keep in mind summer school and  modifications for special needs students.  The students in other grades from kindergarten through second grade are improving  at a  very satisfactory level. Till this moment , we have  not received the NYSESLAT results. But I can tell the results will  be  great for the majority of the students.  MOSL results indicate that most of the ELLs have improved tremendously.Their  MoSL scores jumped  very high They achieved a big leap and many of them surpassed their peers in the mainstream classes.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The summative data helps teachers measure the growth of individual and whole group learning so teachers reflect back on the  teaching methods and make necessary adjustments.  Teacher use scaffolding to modify instruction using sentence starters, translanguage, etc.  The data also helps teachers identify students'  weaknesses and points of strength.  Teachers use data to make instructional decisions to meet the needs of every individual student.  Obtainable,realistic goals should be set to push the students forward.  Teachers also use data to decide student grouping and differentiation.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The Response to Intervention framework provides data to ensure that all students receive high quality, rigorous instruction  matched to their needs. The RtI process identifies areas where students are struggling early, and provides them with  interventions that address those areas, and checks their progress to ensure they get back on track. Students are identified  through screenings, diagnostic and progress monitoring assessments.       RtI begins with strong core instruction, called Tier 1. Students identified as needing additional support receive increasingly  intensive, targeted academic support, called Tier 2 and 3 interventions. RtI helps ensure that small challenges that students  may face early on do not become larger difficulties later in their academic careers. Each tier provides instruction and support  with increasing intensity and/or time spent working on specific skills.     Student progress is measured by administering quick checks of understanding and learning called progress monitors. Using the  data gathered through assessment, observation, and student work, we provide targeted intervention to students who are  experiencing challenges with learning or who a struggling to make progress on certain skills or concepts. Students who do not  make progress in Tier 1 based on screening and ongoing checks of progress are provided with additional instructional support  in Tiers 2 or 3.  Students in need of additional support receive assistance that is designed to meet their needs, called “targeted intervention.”  These interventions are provided with increasing intensity, depending on how much additional support the student needs. This  can mean more time, smaller group or individual instruction, or a greater focus on the specific areas in which the student is  experiencing difficulty. Tier 2 intervention is provided in addition to regular classroom instruction. Typically, the student is  taught in a small group, receiving additional instructional time and/or taught using various techniques and with more intensive   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         focus on hard concepts.  Tier 3 intervention is also provided in addition to regular classroom instruction. Here the student receives more frequent and  intensive support than in Tiers 1 or 2, sometimes on an individual basis.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    The data required from NYSITELL and NYSESLAT help teachers know the proficiency level of each student.In this way teachers  know  the needs of every student , their weaknesses and strengths, so  teachers  can group them according to their test scores.  When the students are placed in the right group, they can perform well and fast.  Based on NYSITELL and  NYSESLAT classifications we find that   30% of the students  are  "Entering", 13% "Emerging" ,17% "Transitioning" , and 40%  "Expanding" .    Our ESL strategies are infused into content area instruction. The following is a partial list of approaches and methods we use to  make content and language instruction comprehensible:   1. The language experience approach (LEP) which focuses on reading instruction based on activities and stories developed  from personal experiences of the learner. This approach has several benefits. It brings together writing, reading, art, and  language. It extends the learners' creativity in storytelling through writing. It helps learners understand that what they think  and say can be written. It is learner-centered and demonstrates that the learners' thoughts and language are valued. It  provides reading material that is predictable and readable because it uses the learners' natural language.  2. Total Physical Response (TPR). This method allows the learner to internalize the patterns and sounds of the language  through spontaneous physical responses such as looking, laughing, smiling, turning, watching, grasping, holding, sitting, or  running. We employ trans-language to make content accessible to ELL students in their native language.  We instruct students in Basic Interpersonal Communications Skills by providing dialogue instructions to aid in communication  skills.  3. Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach (CALLA). This strategy was created specifically for students with limited  knowledge of English. It enables them to become more proficient so that they can take part in content directed instruction.  The main goal is for students to learn the content and skills necessary to become successful in their academic pursuits.  4. Sheltered Instruction Organization Protocol (SIOP). Also known as specially designed academic instruction in English (SDAIE),  Sheltered Instruction is a method whose main goal is to teach content to students learning English through a developmental  language approach. One advantage of this approach is the fact that it draws from and complements methods and strategies  advocated for both second language and mainstream classroom. In teaching ENL students we try to model and explicitly teach  strategies like note-taking , or doing think-alouds. We focus on using graphic organizers as a tool to record key information and  organize writing.We help students summarize or restate learned information and vary question formats or writing prompts to  help students develop critical thinking skills. .We always encourage co-operative learning .Throughout teaching of a topic, we  nourish ELLs' language  acquisition process with appropriate and frequent exposure to academic and social studies  vocabulary.we always in ENL instruction evaluate students' work  using a variety of assessments  including self-evaluation  learning logs, the sample progress indicators.We also use Follow-up Activities to reinforce concepts that have been  introduced.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?  We use the findings to modify language and literacy instruction, integration of language,grouping,differentiation, and  cooperative learning,  Tutoring and  after school programs are also provided to enhance students' learning. Above all, the classroom should be  welcoming and encouraging involving every student.  We modify instruction to meet the students linguistic needs.   Students get additional time to complete a task as well as dictionaries,pictures and small group instructions.  We also use sentence starters and model the correct responses.         Part IV: ELL Programming    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   We implement a Stand-Alone ENL program, using the pull-out and push-in models .We tend to group students  homogeneously  especially in lower grades so that they don't feel embarrassed or afraid to participate.When the  proficiency level is the same or a little different, students can push and encourage each other. Yet some  students are  grouped heterogeneously with instruction differentiation. so that they all learn and do work according to their  proficiency level. We deliver ENL instruction incorporating  content  areas in ELA, Math, Social Studies, and Science.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      The model that we are following is a half-day French, half-day English one in two self-contained heterogeneous  classrooms, one Kindergarten, one 1  st   grade.  These are taught by teachers with Bilingual extension certification.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Through collaboration with staff, our English language learners receive ENL services according to their levels   of proficiency, as mandated by the State Education Department. The time allocation is as follows: beginning  and intermediate levels receive 360 minutes of  instruction during the week; those who tested at the advanced   level get 180 minutes.                    3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Based on the students’ scores from the most recent NYSESLAT or NYSITELL  we have put in place a number of programs to  meet every ELL educational needs.  Special Education students are served as per their IEPs and appropriate services are  provided to all mainstream learners. Our ESL strategies are infused into content area instruction. The following is a partial list  of approaches and methods we use to make content and language instruction comprehensible:   1. The language experience approach (LEP) which focuses on reading instruction based on activities and stories developed  from personal experiences of the learner. This approach has several benefits. It brings together writing, reading, art, and  language. It extends the learners' creativity in storytelling through writing. It helps learners understand that what they think  and say can be written. It is learner-centered and demonstrates that the learners' thoughts and language are valued. It  provides reading material that is predictable and readable because it uses the learners' natural language.  2. Total Physical Response (TPR). This method allows the learner to internalize the patterns and sounds of the language  through spontaneous physical responses such as looking, laughing, smiling, turning, watching, grasping, holding, sitting, or  running.   3-Frame Sentences:    It helps ELLs understand text and sentence structures while learning content information.  4. Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach (CALLA). This strategy was created specifically for students with limited  knowledge of English. It enables them to become more proficient so that they can take part in content directed instruction.  The main goal is for students to learn the content and skills necessary to become successful in their academic pursuits.  5. Sheltered Instruction Organization Protocol (SIOP). Also known as specially designed academic instruction in English (SDAIE),  Sheltered Instruction is a method whose main goal is to teach content to students learning English through a developmental  language approach. One advantage of this approach is the fact that it draws from and complements methods and strategies  advocated for both second language and mainstream classroom.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         In Teaching ENL students we try to model and explicitly teach strategies like note-taking , or doing think-alouds. We focus on  using graphic organizers as a tool to record key information and organize writing.We help students summarize or restate  learned information and vary question formats or writing prompts to help students develop critical thinking skills. .We always  encourage co-operative learning .Throughout teaching of a topic, we nourish ELLs' language  acquisition process with  appropriate and frequent exposure to academic and social studies vocabulary.we always in ENL instruction evaluate students'  work  using a variety of assessments  including self-evaluation learning logs, the sample progress indicators.We also use  Follow-up Activities to reinforce concepts that have been introduced.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      We do not evaluate ELLs in their home language throughout the year.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Differentiations for ELL subgroups are structured as follows: An intensive Phonics curriculum which includes   elements of the Balanced Literacy Initiative, Fundations, and interactive computer softwares has been put in   place to help SIFE students and Newcomers develop language and build content vocabulary. For the 4-6 years   cohort, we use the Wilson Language Program and the STARS Program. These programs provide skill development in phonics,  fluency, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, spelling, and decoding. Although we don’t currently have nor foresee any long-term  ELLs in our school, we also have in place Response to Intervention plan to address their academic needs and help them  overcome the challenges they might face. Our former ELLs benefit from an array of Enrichment programs to help them   sharpen their skills and expand their knowledge base. They participate in After School instruction where they   receive support to complete their homework in various subjects. They are also involved in Art, Music, and Robotics.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELL-SWDs use content-based English and the Wonders reading program and carefully adjust instructional  materials, learning tasks,and classroom techniques for developing language, content, cognitive, and study skills. The  curriculum    materials provided by the school include an ESL-SWD component, complete with workbooks for the content    area subjects using Go Math and Science and Social Studies NYS/ NYC approved textbooks.   So the core of the materials  covered is made accessible to all the subgroups.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   In order to meet these goals, our schools has diligently created a slew of programs and resources as recommended by the  New York State Education Department:    _ General Education with Support Aids and Services;   _ Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS);   _ Integrated Co-Teaching;   _ Special Class Services.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  PS 3 has a very elaborate and level-specific intervention program. The schedule is set up in a clever way that affords levels 1  and 2 students a total of 225 minutes a week to work with an ENL Teacher in small groups of 5-7. This plan allows our ENL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      Teacher to use individual baseline assessments to tailor instruction and differentiate their intervention services for every  student, regardless of their academic levels or capacities.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Two new math programs - discussed below - will be consolidated. Pre-K students will be introduced to a new math program  called MATH FLASH, which is a fun, motivating, stimulating math training program for young minds      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our ELLs participate in all supplemental and enrichment services offered in the school: Intervention, After-School, which  includes literacy and math, Robotics, Art and Music. These are all well established and very successful programs.  They are  enrolled in heterogeneous general education or CTT classes with native English speakers, where instruction (except for the  Dual Language Program) is in English. We also provide Trans-Language instruction to communicate with parents and students  in their native language.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The school uses the Wonders Reading Program in grades K-5. This program includes a leveled library with 3 reading levels,  workbooks, and multilevel component for ELLs.  Grades K-5 use Go Math which is a focused elementary math curriculum designed to meet the goals of the Common Core  Standards for Mathematics.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is an important component of ENL instruction. Research indicates that native language art  development accelerates the literacy gains in both the native language and English, validates the prior knowledge students  bring, and bolsters self-esteem. In order to capitalize on this resource, we are providing our English learners with books in their  native languages, bilingual glossaries and dictionaries, buddy systems, and technology tools such as CDs and DVDs. Some of  these bilingual resource materials are also being made available to parents to facilitate the student/families’ acculturation and  to provide them with the skills and knowledge to become active participants at work and in their children’s school. We also  strive to use practices that are culturally responsive to students. Culturally sensitive practices reduce the level of anxiety in  newcomers and contribute to accelerate language acquisition     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    In addition to the application of approaches like the total physical response (TPR) that are susceptible to engage newcomers of  all ages before they can even produce oral responses, a fairly comprehensive array of services and programs have been put in  place to facilitate their acculturation and integration in the new school system.  (See next response).     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The school uses the Wonders Reading Program in grades K-5. This program includes a leveled library with 3 reading levels,  workbooks, and multilevel component for ELLs.  Grades K-5 use Go Math which is a focused elementary math curriculum designed to meet the goals of the Common Core  Standards for Mathematics.        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    Many new LEP/ELL students need a period of adjustment, not only to the education system they are entering, but also to the  social environment of this country. This is a time during which they need an emotionally safe educational atmosphere that   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         fosters rapid language learning, acculturation, and enhancement of self-esteem. Newcomer programs differ tremendously in  terms of general structure and setup, curriculum, length of stay, and language of instruction. What they do share is a  dedication to helping limited English proficient newcomer students’ transition to the American school system (and culture) as  quickly and painlessly as possible, and to provide educational approaches that emphasizes English language acquisition, while  recognizing that development of language skills is but one of the many steps in the transition process.  Newly enrolled  ELLs get official welcome by a school administrator, and receive, along with the accompanying parent, a tour  of the building to reduce anxiety and invite them to open up to the new environment. They get to visit specific locations like  the nurse’s office, the lunchroom, the gym, the auditorium, and the appropriate bathroom before they sit in their respective  classrooms.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Our DLP, this year in Kindergarten and 1  st   grade, take place in self-contained classrooms, with one  teacher each.  Students receive half of their instruction in English, and half of their instruction in the  other/target language. Language is taught through content areas as well as through literacy.  English and  French are the languages in which the core content areas are taught.  Emergent literacy is taught in the  child's home language first.        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Weekly Professional Development sessions take place on at the school level and at other venues throughout the city. In  sessions held in the school, the Principal, Ms Beecher and her Assistant, Ms Legere discuss the manner in which the school  curriculum must be implemented.  Their presentations are generally supported by teachers’ presentations of best classroom  practices, including ELL support and instruction.  Teachers of ELL attend professional development in supporting ELLs as they engage in the CCLSs.   Training in Response to  Intervention is offered all teachers, including teachers of ELLs.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The guidance counselor meets with staff to assist ELLs as they transition from elementary to middle school.  Weekly Professional Development sessions take place on at the school level and at other venues throughout the city. In  sessions held in the school, the Principal, Ms Beecher and her Assistant, Ms Legere discuss the manner in which the school  curriculum must be implemented.  Their presentations are generally supported by teachers’ presentations of best classroom  practices, including ELL support and instruction.  The ESL Teacher participates in off-site workshops, provided by the Office of English Language Learners and provides turnkey  training to the school staff.

In monthly staff meetings, classroom teachers, specialists, pedagogical support personnel and school  administrators share and discuss content and delivery of curriculum and their alignment to the Danielson's Instructional  Framework and to the Common Core Learning Standards.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Translation is provided as needed through our network of interpretation services, in-house and through the Legal  Interpretation Services. Often language and/or cultural barriers prevent parents from feeling confident in their own ability to  collaborate with schools and assist in their children’s academic achievement. Children from diverse cultural backgrounds tend  to do better when parents and professionals collaborate to bridge the gap between the culture at home and the learning  institution. Some examples of how schools can immediately increase parental involvement and subsequently establish mutual  trust and respect between themselves and parents are: (1) Translate parent meetings and informational materials into  community languages; (2) Offer adult English classes and family literacy programs; (3) Make explicit stated rules and behavioral  expectations (for example, that parents are expected to attend parent/teacher conferences); (4) Invite and encourage parents  to volunteer at the school; and, (5) Offer power sharing relationships by encouraging parents to form advocacy groups, and  enabling them to share in decision making about school programs and policies.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parent engagement activities and supports ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.  Meetings are held throughout the year for specific ELL populations (Bengali and francophone West African)  to make them welcome and where their voice and opinions are listened to and to encourage them to participate in school  activities..

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kristina Beecher, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S. 3/The Bedford Village                                                                              School DBN: 13K003  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The first step towards identifying the parents' language of preference is the home language survey which  determines the parents' home language, then the ATS report regarding the student's language. The parents are  also invited to an orientation meeting to be informed about the program that is available to their child/children.  Meetings were held with the PTA and the school guidance department. All these give the school an insight to the  parents' language of preference.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60   Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral             Language    The majority of the parents  at our school prefer English  as a language of  communication and  involvement but 10% of  them prefer languages  other than English. These  preferred language are  Bengali, Arabic, Spanish,  Fulani, Chinese, French,  and Wolof.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.            Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      Document Name    Month/Frequency Distributed to   How do you plan to translate?   Families    Include procedures to ensure timely  provision of translated documents      to parents.       The following documents are very  important to all the parents or  guardians because they contain  critical information about the  educational programs and services  offered by the school. Some of these  documents are: annual handbooks,  newsletters, school calendar, notices  of parent-teacher meetings and  conferences, documents regarding  testing, minutes from the School  Leadership Team meetings and  invitations to after-school programs,  special education programs, and ESL  programs. All these documents must  be translated into the student's home  language. These documents are  always available when needed.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61           2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as   parent-teacher   conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.        Meeting Name    Month/Frequency of Meetings    How does your school plan to provide      interpretation service(s)?       There are many formal face-to face  meetings with parents throughout  the school year starting from the  beginning of the school year  including orientation meetings with  parents explaining the school  policies, curriculum night, parents- teacher meetings, students'  activities, school safety and PTA  meetings. Informal interactions  include calls from the attendance  teacher or guidance counselor.            3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.               Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.                Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      During students' and parents' orientations, the school offers welcome packages that alert the parents to our  translation and interpretation services.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       There are surveys given to parents asking their feedback regarding the quality and availability of the services offered  to them. During parent workshops, the administration meets with the parents and their feedback is requested. The  PTA also sends our surveys asking for feedback regarding the services offered by the school. There are also many  informal meetings with parents when their feedback is requested and discussed,         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63
