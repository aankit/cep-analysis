The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At PS/IS 288 our focus and mission is to provide each of our scholars a quality education on a daily basis by  engaging each in a well developed and differentiated learning experience tailored to their individual needs and  talents.          2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS/IS 288 is a thriving school community located in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn. We carry out our school’s  mission in many ways. First and foremost, we pride ourselves in providing our scholars with a quality education  daily and this has become our driving force. Through collaborative planning, delivery of rigorous instruction,  partnerships created with our parents, our child-centered approach to educating and nurturing the whole child and  the partnerships we have established with outside agencies, we continue to make strides in this area. We have  fostered many partnerships in support of meeting our mission. Some of the partnerships include: our work with the  Department of Education’s Teacher Leadership Program, Teacher Development Program, District Office Support,  Brooklyn South Special Education Support, ReadyNY, Junior Great Books, Yale Ruler Social Emotional Program,  Literacy Design Collaborative and Urban Advantage, to name a few.   PS/IS 288 continues to grow in many areas and has currently begun to focus heavily on the development of all  faculty members with a particular focus on the early childhood academy and special education teachers. Many of  our early childhood scholars enter our school with limited exposure to standard English language and phonemic  awareness. 92% of our entering scholars in kindergarten begin behind as evidenced by our early year assessments.  As a result we have partnered with Orton Gillingham, (OG) which has been a leader in teaching the English  language for years. All of our early childhood teachers have been trained in the Orton Gillingham approach and  have used it to deepen our scholars' understanding of words, blending words, etc. We are currently in year two of  our Orton Gillingham work, so we are very hopeful that this work will pay off with our current grade 1 and grade 2  scholars at the end of this school year who now would have had two years engaging in the OG approach.    We have also added Fountas and Pinnell to our assessment menu to monitor our scholars and their growth in  reading. This assessment, along with the OG approach and our teachers engaging scholars in guided reading, has us  hopeful that we will begin to meet our goal of 95% of all grade 2 scholars leaving our early childhood academy  already proficient readers.    Currently, 41% of our grades 3-8 scholars have a level 1 score as evidenced by the 2017-2018 NYS English Language  Arts exam. Though we are significantly below standard we have an 8% decrease in our level 1’s from the previous  year. We had a 3% increase in our level 2 (approaching standards) scholars. We also saw a 1% increase in our level 3  (proficient scholars) and a 4% increase in our level 4 (above proficient) scholars. Though we are making progress we  still have more positive strides to make.    We are most concerned with the growth of our English Language Learners and our Students with Disabilities.  Though they have made some gains, they still perform significantly below standard. We have increased the  academic support for both populations of scholars via their engaging in additional after school activities focused on  their literary development. Though our Students with Disabilities are far below standard we have made gains as  evidenced by the NYS ELA exam. We have had a 15% decrease in our level 1 (far below standard) scholars. We had       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      a 12% increase of our level 2 (approaching standards) scholars. We have had a 3% increase in our level 3 (proficient  scholars) and a 2% increase in our level 4 (above proficient) scholars.    Additionally, our ENL teacher pushes into classes and plans with the teachers who are instructing the ELL scholars.  Teachers of both our English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities continually are monitoring the data  of our scholars to ensure they are making progress biweekly. Our NYS English Language Arts scores for our English  Language Learners population are very concerning. We had a 12% decrease in our level 1 (far below proficiency)  scholars, 16% increase in our level 2 (approaching proficiency) scholars and 0% of our ELL scholars scored proficient.  Though we must show growth as evidenced by the NYS ELA exam our English Languages Learners demonstrated  growth as evidenced by the NYSESLAT exam. 22.5% of our scholars tested out of the ESL program, 32.5% of our  scholars moved up 1 grade level and 12.5% of our scholars moved up 2 levels. We know we have a ways to go, but  this is the most progress we have experienced with our English Language Learners.    Our early childhood teacher teams (grades Pre-K through 2) along with their Orton Gillingham and Fountas and  Pinnell training have engaged in extensive professional learning that focused heavily on creating early and literate  readers and writers. Our grade 1 and grade 2 teacher teams engaged in 6-week cycles with a school leader and  borough field office support that focused on creating common core aligned writing lessons that focused on  informational writing and persuasive essays. As a result of our focus on writing and the positive outcomes of these  initiatives, we have incorporated Teachers College Writing Units as well as Ready NY Writing Units into our tool  box.   We created many in-house collaborative partnerships that have been extremely successful. Our teachers continue  to grow and share their learning with one another. Our grade 1 team planned and turn-keyed professional learning  to our Kindergarten teachers after their successful cycle of learning. As a result writing across the academy  improved by 100%. There was a marked difference in how teachers now taught writing, how they assessed writing  and how our scholars now expressed their thoughts and ideas through written word in grades K-2. Scholars went  from writing pieces that were just a myriad of words to writing pieces that now were organized, structured, aligned  with the assignment and reflected the expectations of the writing task. Additionally, our scholars in grades 2-8 have  the opportunity to engage in weekly shared inquiry sessions in which they discuss a text with classmates and  support all of their claims with evidence. This initiative has helped improve our scholars' writing because they have  to use academic language in their discussions, which translates into better articulated writing pieces.    PS/IS 288 has taken on a particular focus in improving scholar reading levels. We have enlisted the support of  Accelerated Reader (AR) in which scholars are tested and their progress monitored throughout the school year.  Scholars take a reading level assessment three times per year and a quiz following each book that is read. This  allows us to monitor the range of texts our scholars are exposed to throughout the school year. This program  allows scholars to read independently on their reading levels and take tests to assess their comprehension of the  text. The test results allow us to recognize the reading skills and strategies that our scholars have mastered and  need further support in. To support this AR movement our teachers continue to update their leveled libraries in  their classrooms specific to the Zone of Proximal Development for each of their scholars and as a result scholars  have access to non-fiction and fiction books on their reading levels. The AR data allows us to celebrate scholars'  reading success both large and small with awards being provided for for improvement by one grade level or more,  most words read, amount of quizzes passed, million words read club and passing reading points goal by 100%.  Though we are not where we want to be, this is one of the tools that is helping us to foster a love of reading within  our school community. .   Our next step as we continue to build upon what we have established is to provide more rigorous opportunity for  our scholars to annotate text, engage in text-based discussions as well as evidence based writing in class. Our  teachers are provided continual training in the Shared Inquiry Discussion Methodology and scholars are digging  deep into their text to find evidence to support their written claims and thoughts when engaging in discussions.  This has allowed our scholars of all ability levels to demonstrate their understanding and perspective about the       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12      anchor text of the week. It also provides them a platform to articulate their thoughts verbally before transferring  them into writing in the evidence based essay that is required that follows. Because scholars have to engage in  both the Shared Inquiry discussion and the evidenced based writing weekly, we are able to continually assess both  their verbal and written understanding of the text. This has made a major difference in our teachers preparing  differentiated lessons in reading and writing to support our scholars varying needs.    We have also added IReady to our support for scholars and require scholars to engage in the program at a  minimum of 45 minutes weekly in both English Language Arts and Mathematics. The program has helped our  scholars gain skills they may have missed in the past. It also allows us the opportunity to further engage our  scholars who are already proficient readers on a higher level. Our most recent end-of-year data showed that we  met 100% of our instructional target goals and our scholars made significant progress in the areas in which the  beginning-of-year assessment showed they were deficient.    Our most recent partnership with Yale University has been a necessary addition. Our teachers are currently  engaging in the Yale Ruler approach. The Ruler Program is a social-emotional program that teaches both adults and  children how to manage their emotions. Before we can roll this initiative out to our scholars our teachers must first  engage in year-long training, which is happening now. As a result of the training sessions, our teachers are already  reporting that this work provides them a different perspective when dealing with a scholar who is in crisis. The  development of the Yale Ruler program at 288 will happen over the next couple of years, but our expectation is  that it will be one of our driving forces in teaching all to have a healthy social-emotional state.    Lastly, in preparing our scholars for College and Career Readiness, our teachers in grades 2-8 use Google Classrooms  as a tool to infuse technology in the classroom. This has increased engagement and made it easier for our teachers  to communicate lesson content to our scholars as well as provide them timely feedback. It also provides our  scholars the opportunity to collaborate in real time. We also offer our school community the following extra- curricular activities that add great energy to our thriving school culture: Cheerleading, Basketball, Step, Chess,  Track and Field, Vocal Club and Broadway Jr. We also offer our school community Student Council, Math Club,  Middle School Book Club, College Access for All, Parent Workshops through ENACT and other agencies. To  additionally support the social emotional needs of our scholars we offer Art Therapy, Clinical Therapy through  Counseling in School, have a SAPIS counselor on-site, and house the Heartshare Clinical Team.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our new Special Education focus has allowed us to create a stronger and more structured Special Education  Department in which our IEP writing has strengthened, goals are more specific and aligned with each individual  scholar's needs and the team now has the same high expectation for what the Special Education Department will  accomplish in the 2018-2019 school year. Our team meets regularly to discuss scholar goals and engage in  professional learning sessions with paraprofessionals. We currently have a 12:1:1 class on each grade as well as an  ICT class on each grade K-8. The majority of our special education population is classified as Learning Disabled. We  have shifted the curriculum to meet their needs by planning collaboratively, assessing scholar data and using  technological programs and tools such as iReady (to support Math and Reading Growth), Google Classrooms (to  provide online access to lessons and differentiated resources) and lunch time and after school tutorials in small  groups to provide additional academic support.    We have found that a major strength of our special education and ENL populations is their verbal skills. They are  very vocal in discussions about their work. We found that a specific need was that scholars needed access to books  on their reading levels, which we provided and are now seeing growth as scholars work toward reading books at  their appropriate grade level. We also found that scholars needed that additional push with evidenced-based  writing and we have planned accordingly to provide many lessons in this area. The challenge of our Special  Education and ENL populations has been their limited vocabulary skills, which we are expanding with both fiction       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           13      and non-fiction books, and specific writing instruction to strengthen their skills including figurative, literal, sensory  detail, research based informational, persuasive, and opinion/argumentative writing.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   We continue to make strides in the area of creating a Nurturing and Supportive Environment. We aspire to become  a school that is solely focused and centered around what is best for children. We know that each of our scholars is  unique in their own right and we go above and beyond to unlock and nurture their gifts.    We continually seek to grow in the area of Effective School Leadership. We work diligently to keep the lines of  communication open with our faculty, scholars and families. Last year's school survey shows that we earned a  score of 3.07 in Effective Leadership. We have already asked our school community for feedback and how we can  become a 4. The results centered around better communication and we are working hard in this area to ensure that  our faculty, scholars and families are receiving a clear message regarding all school initiatives.    Our School Leaders are heavily focused on leading our school. What is best for children is what drives them. They  are heavily focused as well on impacting teacher practice by providing great professional learning sessions for  teachers, providing teachers with authentic and actionable feedback following formal and informal observations,  and modeling their expectations to the entire school community on a daily basis. As evidenced by our school survey  results we received a score of 3.09 out of 4. Again our goal is to earn a 4. We understand that in order to move our  teachers and push their thinking around how they instruct our scholars takes trust. Our hope is that we will see  effective and highly effective practice throughout the school year as a result of the professional learning and  actionable feedback that our teachers will be provided throughout the school year.    The school has also strengthened its relationship with families and the outside communities. We received a score  of 3.30 out of 4 on our school survey in the area of Strong Family and Community Ties. We truly value our working  partnership with our parents and community liaisons. Parent participation in school events and parent teacher  conferences has improved by approximately 85%. PS/IS 288’s relationship with community based organizations has  improved tremendously as well. PS/IS 288 now works collaboratively with a number of organizations to help  strengthen and beautify the Coney Island community and PS/IS 288.   PS/IS 288 continues to make tremendous strides in the area of Rigorous Instruction. We earned a 3.25 out of 4 on  our school survey. We have provided our teachers intense and in-depth training to enhance their practice. Teachers  are provided professional learning in all content areas. We continue to work with the Literacy Design Collaborative  which has supported our focus on common core aligned task in writing in ELA, Social Studies, Mathematics and  Science.    We have developed teacher capacity through our work with coaches from the Teacher Leadership Program and  Teacher Development Program. Their skills have been honed to become facilitators during team meetings as well  as in the area of providing professional learning sessions in the Danielson Framework for Teaching Instructional  Domains (1E, 3B, 3C and 3D). Our teacher teamwork and collaboration has grown tremendously as a result of the  growth and development of our school leaders and teacher leaders at PS/IS 288.                   2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           14      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 21K288   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   663   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Our 2018 NYS ELA data indicates that 22% of our scholars are proficient in ELA, a 4% increase from 2017. State data  also indicates that there is an 8% reduction in the number of our scholars performing at Level 1. There has also been a  3% and 4% increase in the number of scholars performing at Level 2 and Level 4 respectively. Although there are  currently 61% of students with special needs at Level 1 proficiency in ELA, this is a 15% decrease from the 2016-17  school year.   This data above shows gradual growth that is happening organically in our school. Our growth has been coupled with  a school wide positive shift in school culture, focus on social emotional health, teacher pedagogy and deep dives into  looking at scholar data and scholar work samples. In addition to state data, we used the Orton Gillingham Pre- Assessment, STAR Reading Assessment, IReady data in ELA and Mathematics, Performance Assessment in ELA and  Mathematics, Pre-Assessments from the Journeys reading program, Go Math program and scholar written work  samples to help shape our thinking around our needs assessment.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           17      Our last Quality Review suggested that we take a look at our curriculum and instruction, which we did. We decided to  heavily focus in the area of English Language Arts with the understanding that without a strong reading and writing  foundation our scholars would struggle in most, if not all other content areas. As a result we targeted lesson planning  and rigorous learning activities that are differentiated in all content areas, but concentrated in our English Language  Arts classes grades K-8. To help us strategically focus on planning and engagement within these areas we are taking a  deep dive revisiting Danielson’s domains 1E (Planning and Preparation), 3C (Engaging Students in Learning) and 3D  (Assessment in Instruction). Domains 1E and 3C will assist us in our purposeful planning for intellectual engagement,  cognitive engagement and strategic grouping. 3D will allow us to ensure that we continually build in teacher to  scholar assessment, scholar to scholar assessment and scholar self assessment when engaging in the learning tasks  and learning activities.    As a result of our deep look at rigorous instruction at 288 and findings we established a balanced literacy flow for our  K-8 grades with Orton Gillingham being built into our daily flow for grades Pre-K through 2. We found that our  scholars entered our school in Kindergarten with limited exposure to language and phonemic awareness and had to  be very strategic in how we structured their day. We also built in Guided Reading opportunities into our daily flow of  the day. Scholars also engage in a writing block and have to engage in a shared inquiry discussion about the text  weekly. Adding more structure to our literacy block, coupled with providing the educators in our school building  professional learning opportunities that support their understanding and implementation of the additions, has  resulted in classrooms driven by meaningful learning tasks evidenced by the learning activities and learning  opportunities our scholars engage in daily. Our scholars have suggested that class is more interesting, they are  learning more and feel more challenged. We earned a score of 3.25 out of 4 in Rigorous instruction, so we are on our  way. Our goal is to earn a score of 4.    After triangulating all of our reading data we found that our scholars were doing well on their Accelerated Reader  exams, which were books on their readability level. The disconnect was that the data represented improvement, but  did not mean that those scholars were all proficient readers as evidenced by their independent reading of grade level  texts. This was the same with our IReady data. Though we met 100% of our school-wide target and grade goals, which  is reason to celebrate, overall large cohorts of scholars still were not reading or performing on grade level. So within  their current ability levels scholars were thriving because we decided to meet them where they were instructionally  and then grow them to grade level proficiency. This is also why the growth from the results didn’t match our state  exam results. Our team of professionals still note this as progress and recognize that our scholars are getting stronger  and closer to being proficient readers and writers each year. To support our scholars when engaging in grade level  texts we provide them guided reading opportunities. Our teachers have been and are still being provided guided  reading training from our borough office and district office supports. This has provided our scholars differentiated  and targeted support as they engage in close reading of grade level books in smaller groups with the teacher leading.  They are applying the skills learned in guided reading when working independently and in groups during their station  work.    We continue to work extremely hard aligning instruction, materials and resources to meet the varying needs of our  scholars. This has been one of our growth areas as a school. Our teachers are now pulling appropriate resources to  support the learning needs and targets of our scholars based on current data. 85% of our teachers are now progress  monitoring in a very authentic way as they make instructional decisions in the moment to address the learning during  each individual lesson. To begin moving in this direction took team building and trust building. We scored a 3.09 on  the school survey in the area of trust. Once our faculty members began to trust one another, school administration  and the process, we began to move forward positively.    Another difference maker has been providing teacher teams the opportunity to engage in rigorous planning with  ongoing professional learning to support them in their needed areas of growth. Our teacher teams meet weekly  assessing curriculum, discussing any tweaks that must be made, assessing scholar work and making instructional  planning decisions for the week and week ahead. We have a strategic focus in the Danielson areas of 1E (Planning and  Preparation), 3C (Engaging Students in Learning) and 3D (Assessment in Instruction). When we engage in inter-      2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           18      visitations, we visit with one of the Danielson domains as the focal point. Through our partnering with the Teacher  Leadership Program, Literacy Design Collaborative and professional learning on the district level as well as borough  office level our teacher capacity has grown tremendously, which has allowed our teachers to engage with one  another on such a high level now.    Additionally, we have had six of our teachers and two administrators trained in the area of critical thinking via our  District partnership with LCI. As a result of this training our teachers revisited their learning tasks and ensured that  they required scholars to think beyond the surface during learning activities. We also had five teachers and an  administrator engage with LCI in looking at ways to plan to engage our scholars conceptually in mathematics. This  training changed the way scholars look at mathematics in the classes of the teachers who participated and the classes  of their grade team members as they turn-keyed their learnings. As a result we embarked on a journey that was more  exploratory in mathematics, which pushed our scholars to think more critically about their learning tasks, which  resulted in 95% to 98% engagement in all mathematics classes of those trained teachers.    All of last school year and beginning of this current 2018-2019 school year, we have taken a hard and long look at  scholar achievement data. We are very concerned with our proficiency results on the NYS Exams and particularly  focusing on our Students with Disabilities and our English Language Learners. Last school year we took a deep look at  our boys and why they weren’t achieving on the state exam. As a result the number of boys who reached proficiency  on the state exam increased by 6% with 10 more of our male scholars scoring a level 4 than the year before on the  2017-2018 NYS ELA exam. We will continue to work diligently crafting instruction differentiated to our varying  learners. Data will continue to drive this sort of planning. We are confident that we are moving in the best direction  and we feel the urgency to boost achievement in our school.    As for writing, we have made major strides. Because our scholars have the opportunity to write often, their writing is  improving. Scholars have access to Teachers College Writing Units, Ready Writing Units, which are tailored to the  structure of the state exam and their evidence-based writing that happens weekly within Junior Great Books. Our  samples of scholar writing suggested that we needed to deepen our approach to teaching writing at 288. We found  we needed a targeted writing block to specifically teach scholars how to write as well as support their writing efforts  on specific writing tasks. Our scholars also have access to a number of Writing Units including Narrative,  Argumentative, Informational Writing, Opinion Writing, Non-Fiction Writing, etc. This year we are using the NYS ELA  State Exam writing rubric to guide our teacher-to-scholar and scholar-to-scholar feedback during writing sessions We  are hoping to see a major shift over time in the depth and quality of our scholars' writing. Our goal is to expose our  scholars to a range of writing supported by rigorous and engaging writing instruction as we prepare them for college  and career readiness.    At an even deeper level we have begun to delve into and deepen our understanding of text complexity, critical  thinking, conceptual learning, planning opportunities for scholars to take ownership of their learning via project- based learning, google classrooms, discussions and ensuring that our scholars support all of their claims with evidence  from the text. To ensure that rich text based discussion occur, our teachers have been trained in Shared Inquiry. Our  teachers credit much of our growth if even small on the NYS ELA Exams to our scholars now having evidenced based  discussion about rich text and being required to write evidence based essays as a result of their understanding of the  text. As a result of this continued work we expect to see 95% of our scholars at all times engaged in rich discussions  during shared inquiry sessions.    Though we have made strides, overall we must continue to focus our collaborative efforts to improve the delivery of  instruction in each of our classrooms. Though the majority of our teachers have made vast improvement in their  teaching practice, we must still continue to hone their skills as we work toward raising proficiency. We have  classrooms that are thriving and we have classrooms that are emerging. We are working toward having all of our  classrooms become places in which scholars are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing  critical thinking skills. We are doing this by providing our teachers and paraprofessionals with ongoing professional  development in many areas to continue to improve their practice. By June, 2019 our expectation as a school is that       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           19      100% of our classrooms will be fueled by collaboratively planned lessons, 100% scholar engagement and evidenced  based discussions centered around a number of informational texts, videos and other related research.    The strength of our school is the growing positive school culture that we have created. The majority of our scholars  feel safe and loved in our school. Our scholars love that they get recognized weekly during our Eagles Nest assembly  celebration for earning Scholar of the Week honors. We also have quarterly award ceremonies in which we recognize  our honor roll recipients and celebrate scholars for academic and social excellence and academic and social  improvement. With our new approach to foster social-emotional learning our faculty members are paying careful  attention to the many emotional needs of our scholars. Our faculty members have also adopted a mindset that  suggests that our scholars are capable of greatness. This is evident in our thriving classes and becoming the norm in  our emerging classrooms. The expectation has become greater and we are providing a myriad of learning  opportunities for our teachers, so that they continue to grow. By June, 2019 we expect each of our classrooms to be  robust with quality instruction and scholars and teachers who feel respected and love being in the same room with  one another working towards a common cause. We set a goal to get a 4 if not as close to a 4 as possible in our  learning survey in the areas of Rigorous Instruction and Supportive Environment.

Using data from IReady Beginning of the Year and Middle of  the Year Assessments, IReady weekly lesson outcomes and  other lesson outcomes in ELA and Mathematics, teachers will  plan and implement lessons on a continuous basis. Teachers  will use various resources including the IReady instructional  workbooks both in Math and ELA. As a tool to differentiating  instruction within the IReady domain teachers will use the  IReady Math, ELA and Writing Instruction online toolbox which  provides differentiated resources in ELA and Mathematics from  grades K-8 and writing resources in grades 2-5. Teachers use  these tools to created differentiated opportunities for reading,  writing and mathematics focused on the most important  standards and clusters for a given grade. September 2018- March 2019 & March 2019-June 2019)      Teachers will also plan their guided reading and writing lessons  using the IReady data and instructional tools. We will also use  tools such as guided reading books, scholastic news magazines  on all grade levels, weekly reader, etc to meet the varying  literary needs of our scholars. Teachers will work  collaboratively to establish scaffolds and provide our scholars  with multiple entry points using these tools.

Teachers will use IReady at a minimum of 45 minutes  per week for each scholar in ELA and Mathematics. IReady data  will be viewed weekly, so teachers can make informed  decisions on any instructional tweeks that need to be made to  address the needs of scholars. Also teachers will assign specific  lessons on IReady and monitor scholar progress. Lessons  assigned will be based off of what scholars need to address  learning gaps, to reteach information learned in class and to  introduce new concepts as deemed necessary by the teacher.  (September 2018-June 2019)      School leaders will discuss IReady data with grade teams by  weekly and monitor progress of classes and individual scholars  via their administrative IReady accounts. (September 2018- June 2019)       Our teachers will also be provided planning time to  differentiate lessons and create strategic groupings based off of  the grouping data provided by the IReady diagnostic results in  ELA and Mathematics. Evidence of this grouping will be seen  via stations in class as well as other teacher methodologies.  Teachers again will be provided access to the Ready Toolbox,  which IReady data makes suggestions of where to pull content  for scholars as they work in the program.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?   We have worked diligently to create a supportive environment at PS/IS 288. Our school has grown into a place where  our scholars feel safe to take intellectual risks during a lesson free from fear of ridicule. Our faculty members have  taken a social emotional approach to engaging our scholars and it has benefited our school tremendously. We have  created a systematic response, so that we are able to address and support a scholar who is in crisis or in need of  additional support. We have also created a system in which we celebrate and reward scholars for living by our Eagles  Motto which is E-Encourage Everyone, A-Act Responsibly, G-Give to Those in Need, L-Lead By Example, E-Earn  Respect and S-Soaring Towards Excellence. Our focus is to catch our scholars doing something great and it is paying  huge dividends to focus on and emphasize the positive rather than reacting solely to the things that we don’t want to  see happening in the school.    Our entire faculty has grown in the areas of Managing Student Behavior and Creating an Environment of Respect and  Rapport. We must continue to fine-tune our approach and response to dealing with different types of situations and  scenarios. Additionally, ongoing professional learning is needed and being provided in regard to child and adolescent  development.

As a school we found that if we addressed the five following areas, our scholars would be set up to experience  success. We put much emphasis on ensuring that our scholars arrived to school on time, so that they no longer were  missing the first half-hour of instruction. We put an emphasis on our scholars wearing our school uniform to foster a  sense of school pride and not to isolate a scholar who could not afford the latest and most trendy clothing items. We  put an emphasis on scholars completing their class work, scholars completing their homework and we recognized our  scholars for great behavior throughout the school day. We also celebrate our scholars weekly at our Eagles Nest  celebration where we recognize scholars of the week.   We bundled all five expectations into a 5-point system in which our scholars are able to earn a point for  accomplishing each, which is linked to them earning enough points to spend time with our faculty members, whether  it’s for our Fun Friday activities, lunch with their teacher, a basketball game, school party, evening out on Broadway,  etc. This system has helped to motivate 95% of our school and has changed our environment. Additionally the point  system helps our faculty and our scholars to pinpoint the areas in which they did not earn points, which then become  the areas in which our faculty and scholars can create a plan to ensure that the scholar earns the points needed in the  area of need. This past school year teachers used the point system to share trends with parents. For example we  found that scholars who earned their homework and class work points also performed well during those weeks on in- class assessments.

Timeline  What is the  start and  end date?     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high-need  student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE,  STH).   Through emphasizing and fine tuning our five point system we will  address and identify many needs including improving attendance  and getting our scholars to arrive to school on-time.    All 288  Faculty  Members   Sept. 2018- June 2019      We will address this by attaching monthly incentives to our 5 point  system, with a focus on scholars arriving to school on-time.       We will provide opportunity for our faculty to collaborate on  incentives and clubs for our scholars to participate in during Friday  afternoon sessions to celebrate points earned during the week.  This way the reward is immediate.       Our 5-Point Reward System as well as the ongoing professional  learning mentioned will assist in our creation of a thriving school  environment for all scholars including those who have high needs,  students with disabilities, ELL scholars and scholars from all other  sub-categories who need additional support.    All 288  Faculty  Members   Sept. 2018- June 2019      Scholars will be targeted for this goal based off not earning 65% or  more of their points in the areas of arriving to school on time,  completing class work and behavior. Once we target those scholars  we will take a deeper look at their 2018 NYS ELA and Mathematics  Data as well as their IReady Beginning of the Year Assessments in  ELA and Mathematics and their progress reports sent home at the  end of October 2018 to identify if those scholars are also not  performing well on assessments and in the classrooms.

Those  scholars will become a cohort in which we monitor their progress  using our point system to see if they are arriving to school on time,  earning their class work point and behaving appropriately in all  subject areas. The teachers, our dean and members of our  attendance team will work collaboratively to ensure that the  points are put in weekly and monitored. They will also share any  new and emerging findings with school leaders in their bi-weekly  meetings regarding the two cohorts of scholars.       The point system will be strategically used to reward scholars who  were identified for not performing well as evidenced by their lack  of points or those who fell under the level 1 category. (Weekly and  monthly October 2018-June 2019)       Scholars will earn points while working collaboratively with their  teachers to address their academic gaps using IReady and  differentiating instruction to support them in working toward  meeting their IReady targets and areas of the NYS Item Skills  Analysis in which they did not perform well. Progress monitoring  will happen between the scholar and teacher (weekly through June  2019) and teacher and school leaders (monthly through June,  2019).       The 5-Point system has worked for us in the past and scholars who  have not earned enough points to engage in an event or class  activity can tell you specifically where they did not earn enough  points and what they would do differently in the future to ensure  that they earn the points needed. We are now going to  strategically look at how our lowest performing population in  regard to academic performance is using the point system as  motivation to boost their academic achievement.       To support our teachers in their work with the identified scholars  we will provide them additional opportunities to provide the  targeted scholars specific rewards for academic improvement. This  will be weekly and monthly through May, 2019 with a large       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           30      celebration in June, 2019 for those scholars who by May, 2019  have been earning 90% of their points.       In addition to support teachers and other faculty members, we will  provide additional tools and professional learning sessions  centered around engaging scholars who are unmotivated or not  approaching standards. Teachers will also work collaboratively as  they discuss data and ways to differentiate to engage scholars at a  high level where they are. Teachers will also have an opportunity  to visit classrooms of teachers who have had success moving  scholars up multiple grade levels in a school year. This work will be  ongoing throughout the school year with professional learning  sessions happening monthly through June 2019, classroom  visitations to observe best practices working with given scholars  happening from now through May, 2019 and analysis of scholar  data with teachers, school leaders and scholars happening weekly,  bi-weekly and monthly through June, 2019.    ● We will engage and support our families in this area by providing  the following:   All 288  Families   Sept. 2018- June 2019   ○ We will work with the families of targeted scholars to create a  solid plan with our attendance teacher that will assist in getting  identified scholars to school on time daily so they don't miss  instruction period one. (Monthly October 2018-June 2019)       We will share scholar IReady beginning of the year assessment  data, state test data in ELA and Mathematics and progress report  information with parents and host meetings with them to help  them make sense of all the data. Following we will speak with  parents about next steps that can be taken inside of the school and  at home as we implement our action plan for academic  improvement. (This meeting will in November, 2018 after progress  reports have been released)       Ongoing bi-monthly workshops will be provided by our attendance  team discussing our 5-Point Reward System with a specific focus  on the reduction of lateness and importance of being in school  everyday.

Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment   Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.  Our PBIS team members will be at the forefront of this movement. Our PBIS team consists of our school leader,  school psychologist, parent coordinator, speech therapist, 3 special education teachers, 3 general education  teachers and Borough Office Behavioral Specialist.    Because most of the training is offered for free by the city, we will need to budget money for substitute teachers to  cover classes, so that they team may go out and receive the different professional learning opportunities that they  will then return to school and turn-key.    Additionally, time will need to be made for team members to engage in analysis of school-wide point data, so  additional per-session will be allocated, so that this activity can take place monthly on a given afternoon following  the school day. Supervisor per-session will be allocated as well. This analysis of data will allow us to identify trends  to report to scholars and parents during town hall meetings as well as select scholars for incentives such as trips,  improvement in a given category, etc.      Part 4b.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   After reviewing our informal and formal observation reports in Advance and reflecting on feedback provided to  teachers by school leaders it was evident that we needed to focus our collaborative efforts on Designing Coherent  Instruction (1e), Engaging Scholars in Learning (3c) and Assessment in Instruction (3d). Teachers are working  collaboratively and planning detailed lessons, but as we took a deeper look we found that our next steps are to focus  on the differentiation of learning activities that meet the needs of the scholars in a given class. We also found that we  needed to make better use of technology to engage our scholars and now immersing our scholars in the use of Google  Classrooms in grades 2-8.    We see our collaborative planning as a strength. Additionally, our teachers have done a very nice job facilitating  professional learning sessions, highlighting areas of their practice that are effective and highly effective. This has  resulted in classroom learning activities that have challenged our scholars and engaged them in learning in many of  our classrooms.    We have taken major steps toward shifting the mindset regarding teacher collaboration at PS/IS 288. Our teachers  now trust one another and as a result have opened up their classrooms and practice for sharing of best practices and  teachers have been provided the opportunity to engage in a number of activities to improve their practice including  Professional Learning centered on Questioning and Discussion Techniques, Engaging Students in Learning, and  Assessment in Instruction. Teachers have also had the opportunity to engage in looking at scholar work sessions,       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           34      child-study sessions and looking at scholar-data sessions. Teachers have also been allotted much time for  collaborative lesson planning as we work toward ensuring that each of our classrooms is a place where learning  comes alive.    As we move forward and continue to grow in this area, we are looking to further build teacher capacity. Last school  year we partnered with our District office team and LCI to provide 10 teachers and two administrators the  opportunity to take a deep look at Critical Thinking as well as Conceptual Understanding in Mathematics. Those  teachers once completed with all of their sessions took the initiative to lead the work in these areas at 288. As a  result they are working with their grade teams and departments around creating units and lessons that require our  scholars to think critically about and question their work. There is also a conceptual piece built into all lessons that  requires scholars to make their thinking visible throughout their learning task. We also built in a questioning piece  into mathematics that allows our scholars to create questions they have around a given math problem or what they  are learning in mathematics class.    We now have a Universal Literacy Coach who is working with our early childhood teachers providing ongoing  professional learning on best practices in guided reading, Fountas and Pinnell implementation and monitoring,  reading recovery work for our young readers who need the most support and other great strategies to engage our  young emerging readers. One of our second grade teachers is undergoing training along with our assistant principal to  become a model teacher and her classroom to become a model classroom within our school and district. This 2nd  grade teacher will now become an additional resource for our teachers as she will be modeling best practices and will  become a resource in our school.    We are engaging our faculty in Social Emotional work as a result of our partnership with the Yale Ruler Social  Emotional program. This is an important initiative that focuses on the healthy social emotional state of all 288  community members.    We continue to focus on improving our school from within and building capacity within our school. As a result many  of our teachers have been sent out to grow professionally in areas that they will eventually become the resident  experts in. We have an ICT team in our Early Childhood, Elementary and Middle School Academies receiving expert  training in how to write and use IEPs effectively. They in-turn will lead this work in each of their academies with the  support of our borough office support tea. We have teachers receiving additional Orton Gillingham training to  become leads in our school. We have teacher participating in Social Studies trainings, teachers and administrators  engaging in deeper math related work via Algebra for All training and many other great professional learning  opportunities. The particular members of our faculty including our five selected Teacher Development coaches and  five Teacher Leadership coaches function as the experts of a given area that will assist in moving our school forward.  They will function as the go-to people when a faculty member has a question or needs further development or ideas  in a particular area of professional interest.    We project that by addressing the needs of our faculty in this way, we will see the .3 increase in our scholars who fall  into the "2.5-2.9" range and a .5 increase in our scholars scoring proficient as evidenced by our ELA and Math State  exams.

The Administrators leading PS/IS 288 (Principal and Assistant Principals) are focused on the process and product that  engages overall teacher growth and scholar achievement outcomes. The strength of our school leaders are driven by  our schools mission to provide every scholar with a quality education on a daily basis. With this being said we are  taking a particular interest in ensuring that our scholars in Kindergarten, first grade and second grade are meeting  their grade equivalent reading levels by the end of the 2018-2019 school year.    Our school leaders work continually to improve their craft, so that they can in turn improve the craft of their  teachers. School leaders understand the value of positive influence and have generated a great deal of excitement  within the faculty and scholars around the schools ongoing academic and social improvement. This past school year  we saw a 4% increase in our scholars' proficiency in reading as evidenced by our NYS ELA State exam scores.. We  understand, however, that in order to continue to make progress and see significant gains over the next five school  years, we must focus on our early childhood program and engage our grades K-2 scholars in rigorous, differentiated  and well planned instruction that will assist them in leaving each grade proficient in reading as evidenced by their  current grade level standards.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           42      Because of our focus on literacy in our early childhood grades we have been fortunate to be provided a Universal  Literacy Coach to support our teachers in better understanding how to instruct so that our scholars are working in  classrooms that support their literary growth. We are also supported by our District office support team and Brooklyn  South support team to support our efforts to ensure that our early childhood scholars finish the school year proficient  in reading on grade level.    Additionally to assist us we have added to our teaching tool box the IReady program and the Orton Gillingham  Approach to teaching reading. The combination of the two is powerful and we are working diligently to provide our  early childhood teachers and paraprofessionals the necessary training to ensure that both programs are used  effectively and our scholars reap the benefits. School leaders, along with key faculty members, will lead and support  teachers in the understanding and implementation of the programs, so that they have a positive impact on scholar  achievement. School leaders will also facilitate sessions with the data specialist on assessing and analyzing current  data to ensure that we are making progress toward meeting our early childhood literacy goals.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.   By June 2019, 60% of scholars in Kindergarten, first grade and second grade will read on grade level as measured by  the IReady End of Year diagnostic results.              2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           43     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional   development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

School Leaders will engage in continued IReady and  Orton Gillingham training with our Early Childhood  faculty to emerge both approaches as we work toward  meeting the suggest goal.    School Leaders,  Teachers and    Sept. 2018- June 2019   Paraprofessionals     To achieve this goal we will provide our scholars the   opportunity to engage weekly in 45 minutes at a  minimum of ELA instruction using IReady. (September  2018-2019)   of scholars in  grades K-2.      Our teachers will plan and implement daily lessons on a   weekly basis using assessment data from IReady  Beginning of the Year and Middle of the Year  Assessments and Orton Gillingham BOY and MOY  assessment information. Teachers will also progress  monitor steps taken toward accomplishing our goal  using ELA lesson outcomes from IReady (used 45  minutes at a minimum once per week) and Orton  Gillingham lesson outcomes (implemented four days  per week for a 45 minute block at a minimum).  Teachers will use the information gathered to make  decisions regarding how to what texts to select for  guided reading and how scholars will be grouped for  their daily 45 minute instructional block of guided  reading.     Teachers will have access to the IReady Teacher   Toolbox, which they can use to differentiate additional  guided reading and reading strategy based experiences  for scholars. The activities range from grades K-8 and  are directly linked with the IReady lessons. This will  allow teachers to further challenge those scholars who  are growing beyond grade level as readers and meet  scholars who are not reading on grade level where they  are. (September 2018-March 2019 & March 2019-June  2019)  Scholars in grades K-2 will take the Beginning of The  Year baseline assessment in ELA using IReady. The  results will establish individual learning targets and  push targets for all scholars. Teachers will use IReady at          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           44                  a minimum of 45 minutes per week for each scholar in  ELA. The IReady data will be viewed bi-weekly if not  weekly, so teachers can make informed decisions on  any instructional tweeks that need to be made to  address the literary needs of scholars. Teachers along  with school leaders will also use the data produced  monthly to assess whether or not scholars are working  towards scoring proficient by June, 2019 as evidenced  by the IReady End of the Year assessment.     Teachers will assign specific lessons on IReady and  monitor scholar progress. Lessons assigned will be  based off of what scholars need to address learning  gaps, to reteach information learned in class and to  introduce new concepts as deemed necessary by the  teacher. This will be monitored monthly at a minimum  by our early childhood Assistant Principal (November  2018-June 2019)  School leaders will discuss IReady data with grade  teams by weekly and monitor progress of classes and  individual scholars via their administrative IReady  accounts. (November 2018-June 2019)         Our teachers will also be provided planning time to  differentiate lessons and create strategic groupings  based off of the grouping data provided by the IReady  diagnostic results in ELA. Evidence of this grouping will  be seen via stations in class as well as other teacher  methodologies. Teachers again will be provided access  to the Ready Toolbox, which IReady data makes  suggestions of where to pull content for scholars as  they work in the program. This will be monitored by  the principal as the Assistant Principal leads this work.  (November 2018-June 2019)     We will use a number of strategies to address the   needs of our scholars with disabilities, ELLs, and over- aged scholars.      Each of the scholars who fall under the classifications   above have access to a laptop in all of their classes.

Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment   Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.  We will use a number of resources to fund this goal. We purchased the IReady program for the 2018-2019 school  year. Our teachers will be fully immersed in and supported in their implementation of IReady this school year and  will continue to be engaed in Orton Gillingham approach to teaching reading since both can work in partnership in  our quest to produce proficient readers by June, 2019 in grades K-2 as suggested by this goal. We will also budget  money for substitute teachers to cover classes so that our teachers in the targeted grades can have additional time  to plan together, analyze data together and plan targeted workshop sessions for parent meetings.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   PS/IS 288 has already fostered positive working relationships with families and the existing community. As a result,  our attendance has improved, lateness has declined by 50% and disruptive behaviors inside and outside of the  classroom has decreased by 60%.    Because of our child-centered approach to leading our school, our children and their families have been very happy as  evidenced by parent and scholar verbal feedback and attendance at school functions. Parent attendance at school  related functions has increased tremendously and we had a packed house at our last parent-teacher conference of  the year with each of the four conferences for the 2017-2018 school year attracting more parents.    As we continue to foster positive and meaningful relationships with our families, we now have shifted our focus to a  small cohort of our middle school scholars who are still tardy and as a result not doing well in their first period  classes. We will now make this cohort of scholars our focus and they and their families will be supported by our  middle school team of teachers, school leaders, middle school dean, family worker and attendance teacher.

Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.   By June, 2019, 75% of targeted scholars in grades 6-8 will arrive to school on time 90% of the time resulting in  achievement of a class grade of at least 80% in their first period class (Mathematics, ELA, Science and/or Social  Studies).              2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           50     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies your  school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this  Framework for Great Schools element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high-need  student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE,  STH).   Our team will identify the middle school group of scholars whom  are tardy and missing their first period classes consistently. This  information will be gathered using our attendance data as well as  percentage of points earned by scholars via our 288 Points Reward  system. School leaders, attendance teacher, first period class  teachers and family worker will create the cohort of scholars in  November, 2018.

Following outreach to the families of these scholars as well as the  scholars, interventions will be put in place including workshops  regarding the importance of school and how to organize for  success. The workshops will be facilitated by our attendance team.  The members of the attendance team will engage families in these  workshops during the months of November, 2018, January, 2019,  March, 2019 and May, 2019.      Our team will meet bi-weekly to review attendance data,   point sheets and Jupiter grades. Where appropriate  scholars will be celebrated for arriving to school on time by  the members of our attendance team. The team has  decided to celebrate often even if with very recognition bi- weekly.  Scholars will be recognized monthly at our middle school  Eagles Nest celebration for arriving to school on time by  our middle school Assistant Principal and Dean.       Sept. 2018- June 2019   288  Attendance  team and  Parents   School Leaders,  Middle School  Teachers, Family  Worker, Parent  Coordinator,  Attendance Teacher       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           51         Scholars whether arriving to school on time or not will  check in with our Dean and Family Worker to review  attendance data and discuss briefly what is and isn't  working Monthly. More urgent situations will require  identified scholars to meet with the middle school dean  and family work weekly if not daily. This will happen  beginning December, 2018 and carry into June, 2019.      To increase stronger family and community ties with the  families of this cohort of scholars we will engage them in  workshops that will discuss why arriving to school is  important, research supporting the negative impact of  poor attendance on the academic and social life of a  scholar, how to organize for success, etc. The members of  the attendance team will engage families in these  workshops during the months of November, 2018, January,  2019, March, 2019 and May, 2019.   288  Attendance  Team, Parent  Coordinator  and Parents   Sept. 2018- June 2019   288 Attendance  Team   N/A        3b – Parent and Family Engagement   N/A   N/A   N/A   If  any,  list  the  Community  Based  Organizations  or  other  partnerships  that  support  parent/family  and  community  engagement.

Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.  The major resource to be used to make this goal a reality is time. We will need to be strategic in our  communication and time scheduling to ensure that we create schedules that everyone can agree with. We will use  some budgetary monies if necessary to provide our parents with professional learning sessions related to effective  ways of parenting. We will also use monies to provide incentives for scholars to arrive to school on time.    The NYCDOE Office of Parent Engagement offers many free training options run by highly qualified professionals.  Per Diem will be scheduled in case teachers need to be freed up during the day to run parent workshops and or  plan for curriculum related parent workshops. Per-session will be scheduled for evening parent workshops with  their child's teachers.      Part 4b.

In all cases, we will work as hard as possible to reduce class size and/or push teachers into classrooms to  double the impact of learning opportunities provided to our students and double teacher effectiveness.     We will provide teachers with an array of online professional development options so that they may study on   their own as well as with colleagues.      We will provide teachers with opportunities to collaborate and reflect on teaching practices together using   our online environment 24 hours per day.      We will ensure that each of our teachers at PS/IS 288 are fully licensed to teach the subject area they assigned   to teach.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and  paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).      288 Faculty members engage in high level professional learning sessions around Methods of Teacher Practice   using the Danielson Framework for Teaching as a guide. Teachers reflect on their personal practice, visit  classrooms to provide colleagues with feedback using framework for teaching rubric and are provided       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           58      targeted professional learning based off of all prior information and informal/formal observations findings  conducted by school leaders.      The school community will begin to engage in Lesson Study opportunities that will allow teachers to deepen   their understanding of Common Core Learning Standards and work collaboratively during targeted  professional learning sessions to fine-tune their skills and delivery of quality instruction.      We also plan to engage our faculty in intensive professional learning during the 2017-2018 school year that   heavily focuses on our needs including deepening our understanding of Designing Coherent Instruction,  Engaging Students in Learning, Questioning and Discussion Techniques and Assessment in Instruction.   Five teacher leaders each are honing their skills in two DOE Teacher Leadership programs in which they will  use their new skills to lead professional learning sessions in house and lead teacher team meetings.            Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a. Use of Program Resources   Describe how the TA program resources will assist participating children to meet proficiency.  N/A        3b. TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).  N/A         Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information,  early intervention services, etc.).  We assist preschool children from our early childhood programs into our elementary academy in a number of ways.  We engage our preschool and elementary teachers in joint professional learning sessions, so that they may share their  expectations with one another. We ensure that our elementary teachers have the opportunity to bring their classes  down to meet and mentor our early childhood classes. We have had scholars join our early childhood classes to read  to them and express their love for reading with them. We also, provide our early childhood parents with the  opportunity to meet their child’s elementary level teacher early, so that they may establish an early working  relationships.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teachers at 288 are very much engaged in the decision making processes around assessments. Teachers voted on the  best methods of assessment at the beginning of year after being provided a thorough explanation of MOSL. Teachers  discussed their rationale for assessment decisions as departments and then presented final decisions to the MOSL  team, who presented selections to the school leaders. After implementation of MOSL exams, teachers scored exams       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           59      and immediately analyzed student data to inform their next instructional steps. Our 2017-2018 MOSL results show  evidence that our scholars have grown in the areas of English Language Arts and Mathematics.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated. Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           60     which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS/IS 288 (The Shirley Tanyhill School) , in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   PS/IS 288 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all parents/guardians,  including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The school community will  conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement policy with Title I parents to  improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school surveys and feedback forms  will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and enhance the school’s Title I  program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.

This program will begin on November 14, 2018 and will end on May 23, 2019 and will  operate every Wednesday and Thursday from 2:30 p.m. - 4:00 p.m.  An on-site supervisor will  not be required for this program because there will be other programs running in the building  during the ENL after school program with a supervisor present.   Due to the large number of ELLs in Grades 3 and 4, needing additional language support in order  to achieve academic success in school, an after-school program was designed to address their  needs.  The NYSITELL results for Grade 2 indicate 1 student at the Entering, 1 student at the  Emerging, 2 students at the Transitional, and 4 students at the Expanding levels.  The  NYSESLAT results for Grade 3 show 1 student at the Entering, 2 students at the Transitional,  and 6 students at the Expanding levels.  A Saturday parent component will be added to extend the week-day after school  program.  Parents will attend with their children who are already attending the after school  program.  Visual art will be incorporated into the program through ELA activities including  Read-Alouds, responses to literature and other arts activities.  The Saturday parent component  will begin on January 12, 2015 and end on May 4, 2017.  The after-school co-team will focus on teaching and reinforcing key elements in ELA, including  phonics and comprehension skills with the help of the ENL teacher.  The program is being  developed by an early childhood special education teacher (Ms. Petrosino) and our ENL teacher  (Ms. Famina) who incorporate various components of teaching ELA through the prism of  ENL.  Our ENL teacher provides a meaningful language input through a variety of ENL  instruction using TPR, visuals (diagrams, charts, pictures), realia, hands-on activities, and NLA  support. Very often ELLs are grouped heterogeneously and, thus, have opportunities to work  with their peers serving in the role of peer tutors.  An innovative language and literacy software program for ELLs, Imagine Learning, will be  purchased with Title III funds, and includes access to free iPad app/login and home license for  the students.  The program also includes free access to the website with a series of training  modules, interactive resources, guided practice worksheets, traditional reproducibles,  and whole  and small group instructional strategies for two teachers.    The ENL and the ELA teacher will work effectively with a group of seventeen English Language  Learners to enhance their literacy skills and improve their academic performance and assessment  scores. Both teachers will work together to co-plan and design instruction in ENL and ELA.

The  teachers employ two models of teaching: parallel teaching and co-teaching. During parallel  teaching, a group of kids are divided into two smaller groups to receive instruction in ELA. One  group is taught by an ELA teacher who delivers co-planned instructions to the students for half  of each after-school session. At the same time, the other group is working independently with the  Imagine Learning software facilitated by the ENL teacher for the other half of an after-school  session. Teachers then switch both groups of students for the remaining half of the session.

One of the professional development sessions she participated in was a "Global Language  Project's 2nd Webinar of 2017-2018" workshop on December 13, 2017, which offered effective  strategies on differentiating instructions and focusing on ENL students’ interests, learning styles,  and abilities.   Our ENL teacher will continue to participate in various professional development sessions  provided by DOE and outside providers during the 2018/19 school year and, in turn, will turn- key to the other teachers during professional learning sessions.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?    The ESL program administrator periodically evaluates the ESL program using a database (NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, Math, ELA, and  Science scores; Jupiter Grades data; STARS Classroom data, "Imagine Learning" ongoing predictive and evaluative data, report  card grades; "Go Math" and "Journeys" series pre-assessment and chapter assessments tests scores (Grades K-5), balanced  literacy and readers and writers workshops data (Grades 6-8), and language proficiency levels) to determine if students are  making progress and improving their English language skills as well as meeting or approaching academic standards. This data  helps to see if our school's instructional plan is in effect or if it should include any corrections in it. For instance, 2017 Math  and ELA State test scores data showed that most ********in ELA and******in Math)in grades 3-8 didn't reach the proficiency       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           74      standards.  Administration then added extra assistance in ELA and Math to all ELLs in grades 3-8 through after-school tutoring  instruction.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    Our pedagogues constantly provide early intervention services to struggling English Language Learners in grades K-5 within  the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework. Our main goal is to support our ELLs through intervention as early as possible so  that most students can acquire adequate literacy skills. Our Tier 1 students get identified through HLIS, NYSITELL, NYSESLAT,  State tests, Periodic assessments, and chapter assessment test scores. Tier 2 ELLs are provided with support through small- group instructions (3-6 students) in their classrooms, other subjects (e.g. Science), pull-out ENL sessions, and morning tutoring.  Instructions for Tier 2 students are focused on the following language development: phonological awareness, alphabetic  knowledge, fluency, conversational and academic vocabulary, and comprehension. ELLs' progress is monitored regularly in  order to see if students benefit from the intervention, make academic progress and meet goals . ELLs are assessed through  "Journeys" series preassessment and chapter assessments (K-5), balanced literacy and readers and writers workshops data (6- 8), monthly running records, and NYSESLAT. Progress monitoring data is used to make educational decisions about changes in  goals, instruction, setting, and services.   In the process of progress monitoring, some Tier 3 English Language Learners are found to reflect a learning disability.  Therefore, they are referred to Special Education classes and are provided with extra support. If limited English proficiency is in  place, then the school staff develop a new intervention plan based for a student based on his/her needs.  All Tier 3 students are offered an ENL After-School program.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   As seen in the tables above, the data patterns across proficiency levels on NYSESLAT and NYSITELL reveal that 25 ESL students  in grades K-8 tested at the Expanding level.  It also shows that two ESL students in grades 1and 3 attained English Language  Proficiency and tested out during the administration of the 2015 NYSESLAT. Recent NYSITELL data indicates that 5 out of 19  students (in grades K and8) that were tested this year:  one student scored at an Emerging level, one student scored at a  Transitioning level, three students scored at an Expanding level, and fourteen students were identified as Engish proficient  (Commanding level).       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           75      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   There are 42 ESL students (grades K-8) in PS/IS 288.  All ESL students are grouped either heterogeneously or homogeneously in order in to meet all ELLs' needs.  There are  five ESL groups in this school (grades K, 1, 2-4, 5-6, 6-8). Each group contains between seven and twelve students.    As there are 42 ELLs in the school in grades K-8 and all of them come from different classes, the only ENL programs  presently available at PS/IS 288 are a "pull-out"(80%)  and "push-in" (20%) models. of A full-time licensed ESL teacher  pulls out ELLs from their classes for two periods two to four days a week and pushes in eight periods per week to  provide ESL instruction to the students.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              According to the language proficiency determined by the NYSITELL and/or NYSESLAT, every ELL scoring at the Entering  and Emerging levels in these groups receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week which is equal to eight periods per week.  All  ELLs that scored at the Transitioning and Expanding levels receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week which is equal  to four periods per week.  According to Part 154 of the Commissioner’s Regulations (CR Part 154), all Entering and Emerging  and Expanding ELLs receive 1 unit of study in ELA (180 minutes of instruction), while Transitioning ELLs receive .5 unit of study  in ELA (90 minutes of instruction) per week.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      English Language Learners take content-area ENL classes in Math, Science and Social Studies at PS/IS 288. Content-area  instruction is delivered in English with teachers using the following strategies to increase ELLs' access to the instructional  program:   scaffolded instruction  differentiated instruction  native language support (bilingual dictionaries and glossaries)   use of visuals, graphic organizers, realia, hands-on activities  TPR  use of computer-based technologies (SMART boards, computers, laptops, iPads)  heterogeneous groups/partner work (struggling ELLs working with more proficient peers)  Our Science teachers use Scientific Hand-On Inquiry CCS-based curriculum with all the grades they service (K-8). Classroom  teachers teach Social Studies in the classrooms using Communities In Our World curriculum (grades K-1), "New York" by  MacMillan (grades 2-3), Northern Hemisphere: United States, Latin America and Canada (the grade 5 social studies core  curriculum), World Geography Culture curriculum (grades 6-8). All curriculums, materials and methodologies are alligned with  Common Core State Standards.         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           76         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      n/a      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           78      Our main goal of special education services for ELL-SWDs is to provide the necessary instructional strategies and support they  need in order to accelerate English language development, help them achieve progress in school and develop their social  skills.   The following instructional strategies have been developed and implemented for ELL-SWDs in PS/IS 288:   •     Teachers set high academic standards for ELLs with special needs and ensure that students work toward grade-level  content standards by using a range of instructional strategies based on the varied strengths and needs of students.  •     Teachers provide instruction of academic language that is direct, explicit, and systematic (guided instructions in developing  the four literacy skills, vocabulary, grammar, sentence structure, syntax etc.)  •     Teachers differentiate instructions for diverse ELL-SWDs using different approaches and methodology (instructions based  on learning styles, small group instruction);  •     Teachers  effectively and purposefully integrate grade-level materials (e.g. "Journeys", a Common Core Reading program  with an ESL component in grades K-6), current technology into ELLs' daily lesson plans accelerating student learning through  using technology like interactive smart-boards, computers, laptops, e-readers, documentation cameras, digital microscopes,  listening centers, and various software programs;     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   ELL-SWDs continue receiving ESL services in the least restrictive environment in PS/IS 288.   The following currilcular, instructional and scheduling flexibility is used to help ELL-SWDs achieve an academic progress:   •     Teachers promote collaborative working relationships between special education, cluster and ESL teachers to benefit all  students throughout a year;   •     hThere is a team of educators that plan a curriculum for ELL-SWDs collaboratively and effectively by grade level, content  and specialized areas;   •     There is an implementation of co-teaching model for instruction where two teachers work together to design, evaluate,  prepare instructional materials and deliver lessons so as to increase student achievement;  •     Teachers improve instructions through constant professional development training;  •     Teachers set high academic standards for ELLs with special needs and ensure that students work toward grade-level  content standards by using a range of instructional strategies based on the varied strengths and needs of students.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  PS/IS 288 provides targeted intervention programs for ELLs in grades 3-8 in ELA and Math. All programs are offered in English  with NLA support in order to enhance ELLs’ literacy, math, science and social studies skills and improve their academic  performance and test scores.  Our classroom and cluster teachers receive turn-key ESL Professional Development on site. They reinforce "Go Math" program  (it is designed to meet the goals of the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics) in grades K-5 and Connected  Mathematics Project (CMP) in grades 6-8. Also, they reinforce "Journeys", a Common Core reading program, in grades K-5, and  "Code X”, a new comprehensive ELA curriculum, in grades 6-8.  Our Science teacher uses Scientific Hand-On Inquiry CCS-based  curriculum with all the grades he services. Classroom teachers teach Social Studies in their classrooms using Communities In  Our World curriculum (grades K-1), "New York" by MacMillan (grades 2-3), Northern Hemisphere: United States, Latin America  and Canada (the grade 5 social studies core curriculum), World Geography Culture curriculum (grades 6-8). All curriculums,  materials and methodologies are alligned with Common Core State Standards. Classroom and cluster teachers provide direct  ESL support, employ various visuals, manipulatives and effective hands-on strategies in their programs.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Our students will be able to get additional help in our Math + ENL After School Program which PS/IS 288 is planning to start in  November, 2015. The program will be co-taught by Math and ENL teachers and incorporate various components of teaching  Math content through the prism of ENL, its strategies, techniques and NLA support.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           79      Next school year our school plans to open an ENL Saturday School that will target ELLs’ special needs and help to develop  language skills. One of the priorities of the program will be to provide transitional support for former ELLs (for the first two  school years after they pass the NYSESLAT) and monitor them.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Paste response to question here:        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  There are some other supplemental services that PS/IS 288 offers to ELLs.  All ELLs that are "at risk" receive SETTS supplemental services a few times per week. Also, we have a "Beacon" After School  Home Tutor Program (to help with homework or reinforce work being done in school), consultation, translation/interpretation  services for ELLs and their families which are provided to ELLs before and after school.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   PS/IS 288 supports its ESL curriculum with lots of instructional materials and technologies:  •     On Our Way to English Program by Rigby with all of its components (K-5)  •     Leveled ENL library (A-Z levels, grades K-8)  •     Running Records toolkit (K-8 grades)  •     Audio Center with a leveled Audio Library (grades K-8)  •     Multicultural and bilingual library (grades K-8)  •     Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT and Beyond  by Attanasio & Associates, Inc.

How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native Language support is delivered in our stand-alone ENL program with a help of Native Speaker Software (word  processors, desktop publishing and story-building software in students’ native languages), bilingual picture dictionaries and  literature about students' culture and history of the countries they came from. Also, such techniques and strategies as direct  translation, spending 5-10 minutes of each class on various activities in student’s native languages and language skills  (speaking, listening, reading, writing) every day (e.g. mini-puzzle in Spanish) help the students to learn about other language  structures, develop literacy skills in their native languages and then transfer them to learning English.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           80       In order to support age, grade and proficiency levels of our ENL students and meet their needs, all our materials, resources  and services correspond to their ages and grade levels. There is a constant collaboration between the ENL and classroom  teachers and their programs. This allows our students to be engaged in various activities and actively paricipate.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     PS/IS 288 supports its ESL curriculum with lots of instructional materials and technologies:  •     On Our Way to English Program by Rigby with all of its components (K-5)  •     Leveled ENL library (A-Z levels, grades K-8)  •     Running Records toolkit (K-8 grades)  •     Audio Center with a leveled Audio Library (grades K-8)  •     Multicultural and bilingual library (grades K-8)  •     Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT and Beyond  by Attanasio & Associates, Inc.

Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   All newly enrolled ELL students receive the following instructions and support:  • Students are placed in a Stand-alone ENL program and get instructions for 360 minutes per week  • Students are placed in smaller groups  • Students are offered morning tutoring sessions  • Lowering students’ “affective filter”  • Activating students’ prior knowledge  • Providing small-group instruction  • Differentiated instruction  • Constant modeling and repetition  • Creating cooperative learning groups with bilingual peer helpers  • Creating comprehensible input through usage of visuals, charts, TPR, realia, hands-on activities, games  • Simplifying the language of instruction ( e.g. in the very beginning  asking yes/no or one-word questions and encouraging  students to show/point/draw; then developing their vocabulary and all four language skills (speaking, listening, reading and  writing)   • Developing BICS and simplified CALP  • Employing NLA lesson components to make content comprehensible (e.g. reading bilingual books and literature describing  students’ culture and history)       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           81         • Incorporating choral reading and Read-Alouds into every lesson  • Using bilingual picture dictionaries  • Incorporating more reading and writing with every lesson  • Performing various formal and informal assessments (Running Records, teacher-student conferences)  * Teaching students  simple test-taking skills and focusing on test terminology  ** Using all these strategies during cluster periods  There is Beacon summer school program that is offered to students in grades 3-8 and Heartshare summer camp program that  is offered to students in grades 1-5. Both programs provide newly enrolled ELLs with an opportunity to learn the English  language through various literacy activities, participating in different projects and communicating with their peers.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    No language electives are currently offered in PS/IS 288.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   n/a       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  There is a professional development plan for all ELL staff in the school.   Our ENL teacher receives regular ENL professional development provided by the DOE. This year she has already attended the  Annual Professional Conference for All Second Language Teachers (LOTE - The Pathway to Common Core);  Additionally, this year she will attend workshops provided by the Department of Education’s Office of English Language  Learners, including compliance meetings as well as instructional professional developments.  Ms. Famina, Ms. Creazzo and Ms.  Portman will attend "Collaborative Strategic Reading (CSR)" on November 2  nd   and 3  rd   , a two-day workshop that will  introduce teachers of English language learners to Collaborative Strategic Reading (CSR).   This year a few teachers will attend some after-school Professional Development Program courses: “Supporting English  Language Learners”, “Content-based Instructional Strategies for ELL”, “Teaching English Language Learners (ELL): An  Introduction”, “Common Core State Standards for English Language Learners”, “English Language Learners in Your Classroom”.  Other PD's that are planned for 2015-2016 school year will be targeted to support ELL’s on the ELA, Math, Science, and Social  Studies Common Core standardized exams, developing and understanding content area instructions, building comprehension  in the native language as well as through English.  This year, Ms. Famina, an ENL teacher, attended the Annual Professional Conference for All Second Language Teachers (LOTE -  The Pathway to Common Core) presented by NYCFLT/UFT where new ENL techniques and approaches were taught in order to  address the needs of English Language Learners under the Common Core State Standards.  She will continue attend various  workshops and training provided DOE and other providers to better implement the CCSS for ELLs.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           82         how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  PS/IS 288 provides support for English Language Learners as they transition from elementary to middle school. Mr. Turpin, our  school guidance counselor, holds sessions where he informs and explains about possible middle and high school placements,  expectations and provides information to understand about middle and schools. Ms. Famina meets with ELLs and their  parents. ELLs also have the opportunity to talk with teachers and staff members about the local middle and high schools.l   Every year our ENL teacher attend various workshops and trainings offered by DOE and other providers that focus on language  acquisition and best practices and strategies for integrating language and content for ELLs. In their turn, our non-program staff  (content-area teachers and classroom teachers) receive more than fifteen percent of the required professional development  hours dedicated to ENL and provided by the DOE and on-site ELL training provided by an ENL teacher.  This allows our  educators to expand their skills and learn effective strategies and techniques for teaching ELLs in order to meet all their needs.  All records are kept in an ENL binder and secured in an assistant principal's office.  The following topics will be addressed during ESL staff development in the 2015-2016 academic school year:       Creating Content Based ENL Curriculum to ease the ELLs' transition from elementary to middle and middle to high school;       Effective Strategies and Support for Teaching ELLs;       Closing the Vocabulary Gap for ELLs (a six-step scaffolding process, etc.);       Differentiating Instructions for ELLs (flexible grouping, using diversity, etc.)  Also, all teachers in PS/IS 288 have constant access to various professional magazines, books, publications and websites  describing different approaches in order to effectively teach ELLs in their classrooms and during cluster periods.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parental involvement is very important in PS/IS 288. We are establishing a PTA that willprovide parents with comprehensive  resources and encourage them to get involved and stay involved in the lives and education of their children. The PTA hold will  hold meetings and "Breakfast with Principal" events every month and discuss main issues our parents are interested in or  challenges and problems they face.  During these meetings we have and will contunue to evaluate the needs of the parents,  analyzing the data received from various parents’ questionnaires and surveys that are mailed to parents once a year.  In the  beginning of every school year our school organizes a special workshop for all parents where they are taught to reinforce  educational concepts at home (parents of ELLs are offered this workshop in their native languages and/or English).     Also, as mentioned before, parents of general education and ENL students receive various consultations regarding their  children, their academic success and other issues on a daily basis.   ENL parents are also provided with translation/interpretation services.  Staff members (Ms. Famina, Russian; Ms. Casey and  Ms. Mann, Spanish; Mr.Said, Arabic) help to translate/interpet when  needed.   PS/IS 288 holds four parent-teacher conferences every year.  During these conferences parents have an opportunity to discuss  their children’s academic progress with all their children’s teachers, who, in their turn, can address all the needs of the  parents.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Additionally, every year our school organizes Cultural Events for ENL parents and their children, invites all parents to volunteer  and participate in different school events (such as Sport’s Day, Fun Day etc.) and go on field trips. Twice a year parents are  invited to attend a Parent Unity Banquet where they have an opportunity to communicate with teachers and administration  and representatives from SES after school programs.                2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           83      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Qadir Ben Dixon, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           85                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      In order to determine translation and oral interpretation needs, our school staff uses home language indicators in  ATS, parent surveys and informal interviews.   Initial contact with parents of newly enrolled targeted ESL students also occurs via an informal interview (which  also includes filling out the HLIS in the parent's home language) with a translator/interpreter provided and then  the Parent Orientation meeting within ten days after the student’s enrollment. Additionally, the meeting is held  periodically thereafter.    Student Emergency Contact cards are filled out in a parent's home language and then translated into English.  There is always a bilingual staff member to assist in translating during a meeting.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           87      Our ENL teacher is available to meet with ELL parents and supply materials and resources in their home languages  whenever needed.    Parents are provided with appropriate and timely information by officers of the PTA, many of whom are bilingual,  as well as bilingual teachers, paraprofessionals, and other school staff.    Parents of ELLs are encouraged to participate in the school’s Parent Teachers Association.         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication.

These resources  include a multilingual Welcome poster, language identification cards for school staff, info cards to know how to access  an over-the phone interpreter, and T & I brochures.   The Parents' Bill of Rights is downloaded from the DOE website every year, kept in a general office and is being  referred to throughout the school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           90      The school staff ensures that LEP parents are provided with an opportunity to participate in and have access to  programs and services In PS/IS 288 through distributing the Parents' Guide to Language Access (translated into their  home language), where it is indicated all translation, interpretation and other services eligible for parents of ELLs.   A language identification guide is kept at a security desk and in a school general office. It helps to identify a parent's  home language as soon as a parent enters the building.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       The school staff sends out questionnaires to the parents of ELLs a few times a year to make sure that the parents are  satisfied with the school translation and interpretation services and/or work on suggestions provided by the parents.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           91
