This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   We believe that all children have the right to an education that promotes creativity, high expectations and standards- based instruction through expert teaching. The mission of the P.S. 225 administration and staff is to create a nurturing  and exciting environment in which children of multicultural and multi-ethnic backgrounds can appreciate and  celebrate the diversity of ideas, values and culture in the school community.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.S. 225 is a Pre - K through 8 school located in Brighton Beach serving approximately 1000 students. Currently, 43%  of our students are ELL students and 25% are students with disabilities.       Some of the special initiatives being implemented include:   Implementing the Teacher’s College Reading Units of Study in grades K-8       Continuing Wilson Fundations in grades K and 1     Utilizing Exemplars Math Program in grades K-5 to support the development of rigorous learning tasks in   math      Expanding our music and art programs in the early grades, including a grant to work with Marquis Studios    Teaching students to develop an academic growth mindset         intervisitations within our school to support best teaching practices  introducing Little Bits coding and STEAM program in grade 6  visits to showcase schools to exchange ideas and collaborate on professional learning.   To promote strong family and community ties, we introduced award nights and parent workshops to increase the  number of parents involved in our school. We also used our parent engagement evenings to host events such as a  student carnival paired with a parent information evening. We had translators in attendance at these events to assist  parents who were not fluent in English so that they could participate in the events and become part of the school  community.    To build teachers’ capacity in collaboration, we programmed teachers in each grade so that they would have common  prep periods each day so that they could meet to plan, look at student work and engage in inquiry work. These  collaborations led teachers to be able to differentiate their instruction accordingly. We also formed a professional  learning committee so that teachers could have a voice in planning and engage in professional learning opportunities  that were relevant to them.    The key areas of focus for our school this year will be to improve the rigor of our instruction by implementing UDL and  differentiated instruction to provide access to all learners. These instructional strategies will provide opportunities for  small group instruction with appropriate scaffolding supports for individual or group of students. To achieve this, each  grade team will meet with their supervisor periodically for data chats and a review of performance tasks (using a  rubric) to ensure that the tasks are rigorous and differentiated to challenge students and promote thinking. We are  also developing web-based systems that will be shared among teachers and supervisors to track student growth over  the course of the school year in order to monitor the impact of the strategies on student outcomes. This data will be  used to revise unit plans, modify lessons to meet the needs of all students and set student goals. This data, along with  classroom observations and looking at student work will indicate the effectiveness of the our instructional focus.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Currently, 43% of our students are ELL students and 24% are students with disabilities who need supports such as ICT  classes, self-contained classes, paraprofessional support, SETTS and alternate assessment. These supports are  designed to help students who may need a smaller setting, targeted intervention or the support of a paraprofessional  to provide individualized attention.      4.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Areas of Strength   As indicated in 2017-2018 School Survey:   94% of teachers of all subjects say that they had the resources to include opportunities for reading and writing  experiences grounded in evidence from text, both literary and informational.    88% of teachers of all subjects say that they had the resources to link the standards from previous grades to current  grade so student knowledge/skills build onto previous learning as foundations for math concepts.   85%of students say that they are learning a lot in their classes at their school to prepare them for the next level or  grade.    75% of students say that their classes at their school make them think critically.      As indicated in the school's 2016-2107 Quality Review:   Across classrooms, teaching practices are aligned to the curricula and reflect an articulated set of beliefs. Additionally,  student work products and discussions reflect high levels of student thinking and participation.   In all classrooms, students are situated in leveled groups and are tasked in instruction that gradually delivers  instruction so that students are better equipped to develop and show their understanding. Students were engaged in  student-to-student discussions with a high degree of thinking and participation.      School leaders and faculty ensure that curricula are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and integrate  the instructional shifts. Curricula and academic tasks consistently emphasize rigorous habits and higher-order skills for  all students.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      Curricula are coherent and promote college and career readiness. Additionally, curricula are accessible for a variety of  learners.      Areas for Improvement:   Consistency in the quality of instruction is an area in need of improvement, as evidenced by the fact that teachers'  ratings in each Danielson component was lower on average that the district at large. To increase student engagement  and ensure that instruction is rigorous, we would like to build on the instructional strengths by implementing  standardized mathematics assessments across grade K-5, including differentiated assessments. To accomplish this,  teachers will need to collaborate, engage in professional development, utilize common planning time, and closely  align their assessments with each instructional unit.   As indicated in the PPO report from November 2017: "...teachers must be aware of the overall data of state exams,  item analysis and student outcomes, but it is also important that they actively assess students at specified intervals  and during daily instruction."   In addition, data in the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide indicates that students could be challenged more. Only 53%  of students stated that they were challenged in their classes and only 42% of students stated that teachers ask  difficult questions in class.                          Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, as a result of improved instructional rigor, 75% of students in grades K-5 will reach their individualized ELA  targets as measured by student performance results on iReady ELA assessments.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  As indicated in the school's 2017-2018 School Survey:      Areas of Strength:   86% of pre-k through 5 teachers say that students feel it is important to come to school every day.    82% of pre-k through 5 teachers say that students feel it is important to pay attention in class.   86% of students say that they feel safe in their classes.   75% of students say that most students try hard to get good grades.          The school is developing structures to ensure targeted supports are provided for students. Alignment between  professional development (PD), family outreach, and student learning experiences is also being developed.      In response to an increase in the number of disciplinary infractions as well as resulting student suspensions over the  past three years, a student group is designing an anti-bullying program. The student group is called Take a Stand Kids  (TASK) and their pilot program is focused on students in the upper grades. After a presentation in which TASK  students discussed the reasons behind their program as well as their plan for recruiting and training fellow students in  leading activities that would increase awareness of bullying and empower students to take a stand against bullying,  students also spoke to a goal to eventually bring lower-grade students into their group. Additionally, a program has  been launched this year that connects students in grades six through eight with students in the lower grades as  lunchtime monitors. Lunchtime monitors have been trained in a variety of responsibilities ranging from assisting  students opening lunch bags, escorting them to the restroom, and ensuring that the cafeteria is kept clean.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          18      The principal has attended numerous PD sessions unveiling a program designed to further all school community  members’ emotional intelligence. The program guides participants in being able to recognize, fully understand,  properly label, appropriately express, and effectively regulate emotions in the school setting.         Areas for Improvement:   Though the school is actively developing its support structures, current structures do not yet meet student learning  needs and are not yet aligned to engage all stakeholders, thus missing opportunities to consistently promote the  adoption of positive academic and personal behaviors.      Whereas students reported feeling supported by school leaders and individual teachers and all responded positively  to a question about whether or not they are known well by at least one adult in the school, there was also consensus  over the lack of a structure within which they were provided with activities designed to foster social-emotional  learning.      In addition, the following data from the 2017-2018 School Survey show that students' positive mindset toward  learning is below the citywide average in several specific areas:   -59% of students said that most students follow the rules in class.   -63% of students said that most students pay attention when they are supposed to.   -40% of students say that most students behave well even when the teacher isn't watching.   -63% of students said that most students feel it is important to come to school every day.           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, as a result of a supportive environment and improved student engagement, students in grades 6-8 will  improve their score by .5 ( from levels 2.5 - 2.9 to levels 3.0 - 3.4) as measured by the 2019 ELA assessment.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Areas of Strength   As indicated in the 2017-2018 School Survey:   93% of teachers say that they use their students' prior knowledge to make their lessons relevant to their everyday life.    of students say that they see people of many races, ethnicities, cultures, and backgrounds represented in the  curriculum.    88% of students say that they see people of many races, ethnicities, cultures, and backgrounds represented in the  curriculum.    94% of students say that their teachers respect their culture or background.    89% of teachers say that they adapt instruction to ensure it represents all cultures and backgrounds positively.          As indicated in the school's 2016-2017 Quality Review:   Teacher teams consistently analyze data and student work for students they share. Distributed leadership structures  are in place. Teacher teams conduct inquiry cycles that result in student growth in common student struggles  connected to math. Teacher leadership contributed to decisions around curricular changes for the 2017-2018 school  year and implementation of a program serving ELL students and parents.      Teachers serve as grade team leaders. In that role, teacher leaders are working with their teams to identify common  areas of student struggle and guiding inquiry work toward addressing needs. Teacher leader voice played a role in  decisions to change the writing curricula used across the school for the 2017-2018 school year. Additionally, teacher  leadership has resulted in the formation of two reading programs. One program was designed for early intervention  while the other program is focused on providing targeted instruction for ELL students and their parents on Saturdays.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23      Areas for Improvement:   Teachers' rating were consistently lower in each Danielson component when compared to teachers district-wide. In  addition, classroom observations reveal some inconsistency in the application of self and peer assessments  throughout the school.    In addition, the "Collaboration" section of the 2017-2018 NYCDOE School Survey indicates several areas of significant  improvement, although there is still room for more improvement:   -60% of teachers said that at their school the principal, teachers and staff collaborate to make the school run  effectively (up from 45% in 2016-2017).   -56% of teachers said that they recommend their school to families seeking a place for their child ( up from 33% in  2016-2017).   -51% of teachers said that they recommend their school to other teachers as a place to work (up from 35% in 2016- 2017).      In 2017, students in grades 3-5 underperformed in mathematics when compared to the city average:   Students in grade 3 underperformed against they city average by 9.1 percentage points   Students in grade 4 underperformed against they city average by 8.7 percentage points   Students in grade 5 underperformed against they city average by 4.1 percentage points           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Areas of Strength   As indicated in the school's 2017-2018 School Survey:   92% of families say that the principal encourages feedback from the community and them through regular meetings.   95% of teachers say that the principal sets high standards for student learning.   91%of teachers say that the principal carefully tracks student academic progress.    85%of teachers say that the principal communicates a clear vision for this school.       As indicated in the school's 2016-2017 Quality Review:   School leaders and teacher peers support teacher development through strategic supervisory and peer-observation of  instruction. Clear expectations and feedback to teachers are constructed using the Danielson Framework for Teaching  and are aligned with teachers’ professional goals. School leaders and teacher peers support teacher development and  elevate schoolwide practices by sharing actionable feedback and next steps resulting from official observations and  peer intervisitations.      School leaders conduct frequent classroom observations that have been strategically planned so that each assistant  principal has a grade-based focus. Grade-level teachers are divided into groups of kindergarten through grade two,  three through five, and six through eight. Additionally, teachers regularly conduct intervisitations for which they are  strategic in the selection of each cycle’s focus. Intervisitation logs reveal that teachers have observed each other to  offer feedback and search for best-practices around the facilitation of guided reading, math group design, and  readers’ workshop. Teachers reported improvements in their use of the gradual release method for instructional  delivery, the design and in-class use of anchor charts, as well as increased ease of comfort in sharing lesson plans and  instructional materials with each other through an online document-sharing platform.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          27      Teachers receive feedback resulting from unofficial classroom visits that focus on the school goal of increasing all  teachers’ capacity in increasing student engagement. This feedback is shared in-person shortly after classroom visits  and via email. For example, emailed feedback discusses a teacher’s acceptance of individual student responses  without engaging students in discussion with each other. The email closes with an appointment for a class  intervisitation to observe a colleague’s facilitation of student-to-student discussion. Another example reveals a school  leader’s observation that during a math lesson, a teacher was accepting responses from only a few students.  Feedback advised the teacher to utilize any of a variety of strategies to ensure a greater variety of student  engagement.         Areas for Improvement:   Teachers have requested more focused support in the area of balanced literacy, guided reading and student  assessment. One of the struggles teachers face is determining how to best fit in all of the various components of the  literacy and writing periods. In addition, students and classroom teachers would benefit from additional literacy  support personnel to help address struggling readers.      In addition, in the 2017-2018 school survey, only 45% of teachers state that they trust each other.                 Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.

Areas of Strength:   As indicted on the 2017-2018 School Survey:   83% of families say that they have communicated with their child's teacher about their child's performance.    87% of families say that they have seen their child's projects, artwork, homework, tests, or quizzes.    93% of families say that they are likely to go to a regularly scheduled parent-teacher conference with their child's  teacher.       On the 2016-2017 School Quality Survey, the school scored at or close to the district and city wide averages in most  categories related to parent satisfaction with the schools' leadership and teachers. In addition, this past year saw an  increase in the number of parent workshops and attendance at those workshops. This helped to create a more  inviting school environment for parents. In addition, the school held weekend classes for ESL parents to support  parents' English language skills.         Areas of Improvement:   While attendance at parent workshops had increased, the school could do more to expand the number of parents  who attend. In addition, an increase in ESL students' own self awareness of how they are performing in school will  give them more ownership over their own learning and increase parents' participation in school events, including  parent teachers conferences.      In addition, while 93% of families state that they are likely to go to a regularly scheduled parent-teacher conference  with their child's teacher, and 87% of families state that they have seen their child's projects, artwork, homework,  tests, or quizzes, only 44% of families say that they have had the opportunity to volunteer time to support their  school.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          31                       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  P.S. 225 follows NYCDOE policies for recruitment, retention, assignments and support including high quality  professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. In order to implement all school programs, P.S. 225  employs certified teachers who are willing to learn new ideas and strategies. Before teachers are hired, they go  through a rigorous interview process, including questions related to pedagogy, the Danielson Framework, teaching  experience and career goals. An average of seven candidates were interviewed this year for each vacancy. In addition,  candidates must teach demonstration lessons in our classrooms. Teachers are rated using the Danielson rubric by the  principal and assistant principals. New strategies and programs for professional development are researched and  approved by the professional learning committee. When new programs are implemented by the staff, professional  development is provided so that teachers can successfully implement these programs and strategies into their  classrooms. Administrators, mentors, network personnel and grade leaders will work with teachers so that they  become proficient in their area of expertise. All teachers participate in staff development opportunities so they will be  trained in aligning instruction to the Common Core Standards. Outside consultants are invited into the school to  provide teachers with new strategies and programs to address students’ learning needs.   Teachers will have opportunities to grow as professionals. Through this work they will:   - develop skills in describing and analyzing student learning using evidence and example   - self assess and identify professional learning required to become more effective   - develop strong questioning techniques and skill in asking questions in multiple ways to provide multiple pathways  for students to engage in rigorous academic tasks   - develop skill and understanding in the principles of UDL   - develop skills in improving professional practice around teacher effectiveness related to the practice of designing  coherent instruction, engaging students in learning, monitoring and assessing student learning, and developing  questioning and discussion techniques.        2b.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  The Pre-K staff holds an annual Parent Tea during the month of October in which families receive a comprehensive  overview of what to expect in Pre-K and an understanding of the NYS Pre-kindergarten Foundation for the Common  Core. Throughout the year the Pre-K teachers, the Early Childhood social worker and the school nurse meet with  parents to educate and inform them about developmental stages common to 3-5 year old children. Teachers and  social workers meet with parents on a regular basis to discuss their child’s development and if necessary make  referrals to the Committee on Preschool Special Education for possible early intervention services. For example,  speech or SEIT services. Teachers also screen all children with the ESI-R in an effort to capture potential  developmental delays and whether English language acquisition support is needed. This screening tool also helps  teachers to better meet their students’ needs and provide individualize instruction. The use of the Early Childhood  Environmental Rating Scale-r (ECERS-R) ensures that the learning environment is developmentally appropriate and  that teachers are meeting the needs of our Pre-K learners. Teachers meet with their administrators to review the  ECERS-R report in order to make certain that their Pre-kindergarten classrooms are providing the foundation of skills  and the knowledge necessary to set their students on the path for college and career. In addition to the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      aforementioned, the pre-school teachers are being trained in the Work Sampling System (WSS). The WSS is an  authentic, performance-based assessment that provides teachers with the framework to strategically document  students’ behavior, knowledge and approaches to learning. Teachers are being trained to observe their individual  students to ensure that instruction is meeting the needs of all students. The Preschool classroom teachers invite  parents to the classroom for special performances and in-house classroom trips so that parents have the opportunity  to extend learning at home. At the end of every school year, the Pre-K teachers meet with the Kindergarten teachers  to provide them any reports and pertinent information about each individual student. P.S. 225 hosts an annual Open  House/Transition to Kindergarten for our existing Preschool families and the community families. At the open house,  families of incoming kindergarten students and our existing families meet the Kindergarten teachers and  administration to gain information and ask question about the upcoming year.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The Professional Learning Committee will guide all professional learning decisions based on teacher observation data,  Quality Review feedback, student data and teacher requests. Grade teams and vertical teams will meet regularly to  select and implement multiple assessment measures. Grade and vertical teams will meet to examine assessment  results and adjust planning and instruction accordingly.   At the beginning of the school year, a teacher team was formed to administer and analyze data from Fountas and  Pinnell benchmark assessments. Professional development was provided to support the team in administering the  benchmark with fidelity and accuracy. Using the data, teachers will receive PD and other supports in order to design  small group instruction for targeted students to improve student outcomes.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43        Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school.

The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input.

By creating opportunities to analyze students work, there is an increase of  professional knowledge about curriculum, students, methods, strategies, assessments, and  contextual factors.  There is an ongoing professional development series that PS 225 teachers, including ENL  teachers, will be attending throughout the school year hosted by Teacher’s College:   Adapting  Units of Study for English Language Learners Institute.  This professional development is in  effort to support the English Language Learner developing topics such as Key Ways to Ensure  Comprehensible Input, Tackling Tricky Vocabulary through Reading, Note-Taking, and  Conversation, and Language Patterns and Prompts.  All professional developments will be  geared towards supporting English language development skills.

Parents of ENLs are encouraged  to participate in parent engagement activities to assist their children's academic and emotional  development.  Workshops for parental engagement are conducted by administrators, the parent  coordinator, and ENL teachers.  Workshops will be held at various times in order to accommodate our  parents' diverse time schedule.  These workshops will be facilitated by ENL teachers, non-ENL teachers  and our Parent Coordinator and will cover many different topics.    A meeting will be scheduled in September to acquaint newly arrived parents and their children to our  school.  At this time parents will be invited to meet their child/children's teachers and listen to an  overview of the programs offered to their children.  In addition, support staff will be introduced to parents  to provide a clear picture of their roles and to ensure parents that their child's education is a priority here  at PS 225.  We use several different modes of communication to notify parents of upcoming meetings; (phone  conferences, email,  monthly newsletters and calendars). Staff members serve as translators and we utilize  translated documents posted on the Department of Education Website.  We also use the Messenger phone  notification system to communicate important messages to parents via telephone.   Parent involvement is a priority at P.S. 225.  Parents are encouraged to become actively involved in our  school by having the opportunity to join the PTA (Parent Teacher Association).  At P.S. 225 we have an  open door policy which allows parents to communicate with their child's teacher whenever needed to  discuss the needs of the child to help them grow academically and socially.  There are set times for  parents to utilize our library media center.  The parent resource program will meet the needs of the  parents by allowing them to have access to literature and computer programs especially designed for  ENLs.   In addition, P.S.225 will offer an after school program for parents of ENLs.  The program is structured to  address parent language needs and develop confidence and motivational skills.  Through our weekly  school based ENL classes, parents will develop the vocabulary, grammar, comprehension and writing  skills to assist in their process.  The parent programs goal is to target parents needs to acquire strategies to  enhance their language stages to further assist them in maintaining a strong academic relationship with  P.S. 225 and their families.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    The program will be held on Tuesday and Thursday mornings.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  It is an ongoing effort to ensure that instruction is guided and implemented based on data from formative assessments used  during the school day, and throughout the academic year.  The workshop model guides our literacy blocks in our ELA periods  and this frame lends itself to the implementation and execution of some formative assessments.  Some of the formative  assessments used are teacher generated quizzes, entrance and exit slips, teacher/student conferences and daily small group or  individual observations.  Teachers also implement the discussion protocol which lends itself to the Engage NY curriculum in  which our middle school utilizes.  Elementary grades utilize the teachers college approach of pre assessment/post assessment  to drive instruction.  Other effective formative assesments that teachers use to guide instructional planning for ELLs are  running records,  I-Ready data and Fountas and Pinnell Assessments.  There are various protocols in place to check for  understanding and used as formative assessments such as Stop, Jot and Post, Two-Cent Protocol and One-Minute Essay.   In  whatever shape it takes, formative assessments are used to redefine teacher's practice based on a sharper understanding of  current levels of student performance. The NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data are used for grouping and ESL instrucution.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Structures in place include ENL teachers taking part on monthly curriculum meetings with representatives from all learning  communities to share strategies/support for ENL learners.  To further support this effort, ENL and classroom teachers work  collaboratively to plan and create assessments to analyze data.  Goals are infused into PS 225s Units of Study along with  standards based instruction to address concepts of print, phonological awareness, phonics, vocabulary, and  comprehension.  Reading and writing lessons are planned to include high order questioning strategies. Emphasis may include  ELL and special ed modifications to scaffold instructional practices. Language standards are incorporated to adjust our  instructional goals accordingly. Strengths and weakness of students may be discussed for further implementation of language  acquisition goals.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Since the goal of  a summative assessment is to evaluate student learning at the end of an instructional unit by comparing it  against some standard or benchmark, the summative assessments PS 225 uses are often high stakes.  P.S. 225s  focus for the  2018-2019 school year is to build upon the foundations we have developed in implementing the Common Core Learning  Standards. In addition,  teachers identify various ways to assess our students' progress using summative assessments which  include:  NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, NYS ELA, NYS Math, NYC Performance Assessments (MOSLs), Writing Support System (WSS),  NYSAA, Schoolnet Predictive, Mid-Term Exams and to identify students' preferred learning styles, strengths, weaknesses and  individual learning needs. ENL teachers also work with classroom teachers to establish students' reading levels using resources  like Fountas and Pinnell and I-Ready.  There are different components, such as word identification, letter and sound  correspondences, and independent reading levels.  Reading behaviors are recorded and assessed for levels.  Fountas and  Pinnel also include a writing component.  With this assessment data, we are able to identify each child's strengths and  weaknesses at a more specific level.  They help the school's instructional plan to target each learners reading strength and  weakness to differentiate teaching in the classroom.  Through the uses of Schoolnet, we can identify the specific skill for which  the child requires the most intervention. To assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs, we use Writing Support System which  addresses and evaluates all the various components of literacy such as phonemic awareness, phonics, decoding, using  strategies to construct meaning from print, using strategies to create invented and conventional spelling, gaining meaning by  listening and using writing strategies to convey ideas. The cumulative data gathered from these aforementioned assessments  serve as both the foundation and the drivers of our ELL instructional plans.  They provide the information we need to  differentiate and customize the instruction and grouping of our students. An interactive computer based program called  Imagine Learning English is also employed in efforts to support our ENLs.  Imagine Learning English reads passages and  directions to students in their native language.  As students progress, this scaffold is removed and students are exposed to the  English language with increasing frequency and duration.  As a result, we are able to accurately evaluate, provide targeted  assistance and achieve measurable progress.  We will effectively individualize and differentiate instruction within the context  and framework of a rigorous, standard based curriculum. Through the effective planning and usage of technology, small group  instruction, UDLs and visual aids the achievements of all students will be continually monitored. Detailed information on each  student about specific learning needs and daily direct intervention monitored through the various technology programs at  platforms at the school (Stars and Engrade) will help students attain mastery. Extensive differentiated strategies, techniques  and learning modalities need to be developed, incorporated and utilized so that learning is not repetitive but will have a fresh  presentation and rigorous content. Technology usage will facilitate immediate feedback and data for students and  teachers.  Establishing a cohesive and comprehensive research based plan for professional development, collaborative  planning and informed decision making utilizing data, and regular assessment with meaningful feedback is key for the  successful implementation of our focus.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The structures in place in order to support our efforts to make all instruction comprehensible and accessible to all students  are, the multi-tiered approach of RTI which begins with high quality instruction and universal screening of all  children.  Struggling learners are provided with interventions at increasing levels of intensity to accelerate their rate of  learning.  Another structure is our Reading Recovery Program in which is designed for at-risk students in grade 1, taught by a  certified Reading Recovery Teacher.  In addition, classroom teachers provide small group Academic Intervention Services to at   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         risk students or students' summative data indicates a need for such services.  Flexible grouping is employed in each classroom,  along with the use of IReady to ensure that all academic intervention needs are met.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Teachers follow a procedure to respond to intervention for students in need of extra support.  A  "Response to Intervention"  packet is necessary  after having a conversation with the School Assessment Team (SAT) to discuss students individual  needs.  Once this packet is completed, it is submitted to our school psychologist.  Along with this packet, copies of the most  recent report card, class, tests, copies of the written assignments, I-Ready reports, and anecdotes are all attached. At this  level, students are in Tier II intervention in which weekly teacher and AIS reports are documented with students strengths and  weaknesses. This is ongoing for 4-6 weeks. The AIS provider then sends home a parent letter which requires a signature. The  SAT meets weekly to analyze, interpret, and use the data to adjust instruction and plan lessons.For the 2018–2019 school year,  our leadership team chose Response to Intervention (RTI) to address students’ diverse needs and foster school improvement.  Designed for use in the general classroom, RTI uses graduated levels, or tiers of support, individualized goals, and frequent  monitoring to tackle students’ specific academic and behavioral problems. RTI uses 3 tiers of intervention.  Student data  guides instructional specialists to determine what Tier is necessary for modification. Students with Tier 1 intervention receive  high quality core instruction. Based on the data collected, students on the Tier 2 and Tier 3 levels are provided with  increasingly intensive intervention to proactively address their area difficulty.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].     There are several outcome assessments used to evaluate and inform our ELL program such as NYSESLAT, NY state ELA and  Math exams.  The NYSESLAT is used to evaluate the English language proficiency of our ELL students.  This information is used  as a tool to inform instruction for the following school year since it is administered every Spring.  The NYSESLAT is used to  determine the skills in which our students have difficulty and provide interventions for the modalities that require  improvement.  We can also identify subgroups of students by comparing their NYSESLAT and ELA results.   We use the EDAT  tool to analyze student growth on the NYSESLAT.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We share our ELL Data Analysis Tool data findings with all teachers and disseminate all pertinent information regarding our  ENL students.   We do that by collaborating with our IT teacher to make data comprehensible and accessible to all classroom  teachers by use of spreadsheets viewable to all.  Such findings are also found in our inquiry cycles.                   Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   PS 225s ENL program is the Freestanding ENL model. Instruction in our ENL program is provided through both pull  out/push-in services.  ENL services are delivered by certified ENL teachers along with both general and special  education teachers.  The ENL instructional program is aligned with mandated ENL/ELA Common Core  Standards.  Students at the Entering/Emergent levels  in the Freestanding ENL program receive 360 minutes of ENL  per week.  Students in  the Transitioning / Expanding levels receive 180 minutes and Commanding students receive 90  minutes of instruction per week in ESL and ELA.  This explicit ENL instruction is delivered according to CR Part  154.  The students are grouped  heterogeneously for targeted area instruction based on their NYSITELL and  NYSESLAT   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         scores.  The ENL and general education teachers service via the integrated model that works best for those particular  circumstances.  We use a workshop model of instruction in which teachers conduct a mini-lesson with a clearly stated  teaching point.  During the mini-lesson teachers model a specific learning strategy and then students are given the  opportunity to apply that strategy individually and/or in small groups with varying degrees of support from the  teachers.  Scaffolding techniques are actively used.  The schedule of our ENL service providers are adjusted to meet  the needs of the students so that all ENLs receive their mandated time needed  to satisfy the Commissioner's  Regulations for Part CR-154.  b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     We do not have a Transitional Bilingual Education program at this time, if needed, we will open a bilingual program      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      In our dual language program, our students are heterogeneously grouped along with mixed proficiency levels of five  students per group at small tables.  Small group instruction is provided by the dual language teacher and academic  intervention specialist in Fundational/Vocabulary skills and guided reading.  Mini lessons using the teacher's College  reading and writing program provide modeled and guided instruction for the English Language Learner.  Students  write on various topics independently and with partners.  All four language acquistion skills are implemented in the  dual language program.  Content instruction in social studies, science and math incorporates: manipulatives,  authentic realia, songs and photo/strategy anchor charts as scaffolding guides for ELLs.  The dual language classroom  is color coded: blue-English and red-Spanish for easy language identification and connection to content materials  including books and charts.  Turn and talk, and think, pair, share encourage student participation, speaking and  listening skills. The dual language teacher models fluent reading strategies using multicultural, fiction and non-fiction  books to enhance instruction.  Additionally, focused reading strategies and content/sight word vocabulary provide  opportunities for ELL students to engage in discussion, questioning and higher order thinking within small group  instruction.  Instruction is scaffolded throughout the dual language program to meet ELL student needs.  The dual  language teacher's observation, conference notes  and content unit assessments provide important data to drive  instruction.  The NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT are analyzed by the dual language teacher to show progress through out  the program.   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   At the start of each school year, the ENL Coordinator, ENL staff and  administrators meet to ensure that all ELLs are receiving  their mandated number of instructional minutes.  Students are  grouped accordingly to the mandated program models.   All of  our English Language Learners receive the New York State mandated ENL/ELA instructional time which is based on students’  proficiency level. Entering and Emerging students receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per  week.   Transitioning and  Expanding ENLs receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week.  Commanding students receive 90 minutes per week.  Thus  students are grouped accordingly to  proficiency levels, based on the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL scores and mandated hours.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?    Our ENL newcomers are assessed with the NYSITELL.  Spanish speaking students are given a Spanish LAB-R in addition  to  assess their skills in their native language. We provide translated New York State exams for the students upon request,  if  available in their language. We employ the services of Big Word Translation and Interpretation services for low incidental  languages such as Uzbek, Georgian, Arabic  and Urdu for state exams.  Bilingual glossaries and dictionaries are also provided  for the students. Students are prepared to use these resources throughout the school year.  Our bilingual staff are available to  assist with oral translation to ENLs when necessary.  In addition, we utilize many computer simulation programs as well as  translated assessments and/or translators to ensure our ENL students are evaluated appropriately.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    At P.S. 225, we differentiate instruction according to the needs of students. (a) Students who have been identified as having an  interrupted formal education (SIFE) receive their mandated 360 minutes of ENL services weekly.  In addition, they also receive  academic support services in both reading and math.  They are encouraged  to participate in ENL after school programs as well  as all extra curricular activities offered throughout the year. (b)Newcomers will continue to receive both push-in and pull-out  ENL services, with the number of mandated instructional minutes according to their levels of English proficiency.   ENLs will  continue to have the opportunity to partake in all ENL supplemental ENL programs such as our ENL morning Academy, ENL  Saturday Academy and our after school Immigrant program. The ENL provider collaborates with the general Ed/Special Ed  teachers to modify their assignments and provide productive work that engages newcomers in language learning.  We are  aware of our newcomers emotional needs in adapting to a new culture.  Therefore, we pair beginners with students who are  more advanced and share a common native language.   In addition, we use translators as needed and in testing situations. (c.)  ENLs who have been receiving services from 4 to 6 years, as well as Long Term ENLs (those completing 6 years), will continue  to be eligible to participate in our Title III ENL After School program where our highly qualified ENL providers can service  struggling students in a small-group setting.  (d.) Some English language learners stay within the program for many years. We  analyze our NYSESLAT data to identify which modalities need to be supported during the school year.  We have found that  students perform better on the listening and speaking subtests than they do on the reading and writing subtests. As a result,  we provide instruction to remediate this deficiency. Students are engaged in lessons that are designed to teach reading and  writing strategies during their ENL periods, general classroom literacy periods. The BESIS extension of services is provided to  identify long-term ENLs.  This allows Long Term ENLs to qualify for testing modifications and accommodations.  (e)  Former ENLs receive 90 minutes a week of integrated ENL and testing accommodations.   These testing accommodations  include separate location, extended time (time and a half), use of bilingual glossaries, use of English/alternative language test  editions and an oral translator upon request.    In addition to our current ENLs, we also provide these targeted intervention  services for ENLs who score a Commanding level on the NYSESLAT to continue giving transitional support for at least two years  after testing out. Some of these students may receive AIS push-in services in ELA and Math so they can continue progressing  academically.           6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?      Strategies that assist in making instruction more comprehensible include simplifying but, not artificially restricting language  structures (shorter sentences, use of unambiguous terminology); contextualizing both oral and written texts with pictures,  charts, diagrams, and realia; providing for repeated access to ideas and vocabulary; and creating interaction structures that  allow for both comprehension and the need to act on and talk about content.  The special education teacher aligns instruction  with the classroom teacher providing support to the students.  One strategy is to modify the content materials used in the  subject area being taught.  Another strategy is to scaffold materials learned by using graphic organizers, and pre-teaching  vocabulary for conceptual knowledge in learning new information.  The special education teacher uses additional instructional  materials to accelerate English language development. We also use visual representations, modeling, role-playing, and total  physical response method of teaching.  Students are given ample opportunities to have extended interaction with peers of  varying English proficiency levels to enhance their English language development.  In conjunction, the accessibility and use of  individual i-pads, bilingual dictionaries, bilingual glossaries of content area vocabulary is given to each student.  Interactive  Smart Board activities have also been implemented to meet the needs of ENL/SWDs. We implement Common Core throughout  all grade levels.   The ENL program is aligned with our rigorous requirements that include teachers support, as well as  classroom resources that reflect the city and state standards. I-Ready is also used to provide rigorous grade level instruction  and practice to meet individual or small group needs.  I-Ready is a personalized student instruction program based to meet  student needs and ongoing progress for teachers to monitor. It is used as a diagnostic tool to determine student’s areas in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      need of support.  Another strategy to develop academic language is to provide multiple points of entry for students according  to their English proficiency level.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?    P.S. 225 uses a content and general education curriculum that is Common Core Learning Standards based and adapted to  meet the wide range of needs of our diverse student population. Teachers teach at a slower pace and revisit lessons when  necessary .  Our ENLs with special needs (depending on their IEPs) are assigned paraprofessionals or placed in appropriate  settings such as self-contained (12:1:1) or ICT settings, which allow these students to learn at an appropriate level and pace.  These paraprofessionals assist teachers in providing individualized instruction and helping students to learn successfully at  their own pace. Those with IEPs receive all the necessary services and accommodations dictated by the IEP and the ENL and  classroom teachers work collaboratively to provide the least restrictive environment. Team teaching as well as the push- in/pull-out model, is carefully integrated in order to provide accurate services.In addition, the use of smaller classes with  adapted content materials in a blended model has also been successfully implemented.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  P.S. 225 targeted students receive Academic Intervention Services (AIS) in addition to the mandated ENL services. Additional  support may include explicit vocabulary instruction (i.e., pre-teaching and contextualizing vocabulary), alternate reading text,  and scaffolded writing activities. AIS also provides remedial math and ELA intervention by certified teachers. In the Pre-K,  Kindergarten and 1st grade, Wilson Fundations program is being implemented. The early grade intervention program is  designed for at-risk students in grade 1, which is taught by a certified Reading Recovery Teacher. In grades 2 and 3  Fundations  Intervention is utilized for those in need of targeted interventions.  Resource Room is provided 5 periods per week for IEP  students in need of academic support by the Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS) as per their IEP.  All classes  are taught in English, however, Native Language materials are provided to all classroom teachers and are available in the ENL  office.  There is an AIS Early Morning Literacy program available for students in grades 1, 3 and 5.  Reading recovery is a one- on-one Early Literacy Intervention Program to accelerate students in grade 1 in the regular main stream classroom.  A certified  Reading Recovery teacher works with these students on a daily basis and monitors their progress and evaluates the students  through running records, observations as well as Fountas and Pinell.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Due to the success of our existing Kindergarten level dual language program, we are going offer a Kindergarten Dual Language  program again as well as extend it to our first grade for the upcoming school year.  In addition, a Title III After-School program  for grades K-8, which will provide a place and time for homework, extra academic support, and enrichment activities. These  programs are particularly helpful for students who may not have access to academic resources or help at home.  Our fully  licensed and highly qualified ENL/Dual Language teachers, will be working this program and an administrator will oversee the  program.  This program will allow the students to stay after school twice a week • homework • class projects• extra help with  class work• teachers, staff, and peer tutors available for one-on-one help• small group guidance when students are working  on related topic• A focused setting for academic work.  We will also continue to offer our ENL Saturday Academy for students  in grades 3 and 4.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   P.S. 225 works diligently to ensure that all ENLs are afforded equal access to all school programs. Letters are sent home with  translation attachments.  Our parent coordinator sends messages out on the Remind app. and includes pertinent dates of  programs on our monthly calendar.  All ENLs are urged to attend after-school programs where they are encouraged to  participate in enjoyable, non-threatening and educational activities.  They are encouraged to buddy up and socialize with peers  in their native language, thereby promoting social academic growth and self-esteem. ENL students are encouraged to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      participate in our afterschool and Saturday ELA and Math Test Prep courses to help prepare those students new to test taking  to become familiar with New York State testing.  The Shore Front Y after-school program provides homework assistance in  math, reading, and school enrichment model programs such as theater, dance and art     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  At P.S. 225, technology aids are deployed in every classroom and both visual and hands-on materials are used to support all  students and differentiate instruction. Each classroom is equipped with a SMART Board that teachers use to present mini- lessons and to research interesting topics related to particular lessons. Some classrom are also equipped with both a Smart  board and a Promethean Board for parallel teaching .  Laptop/I-Pad carts are stationed in each classroom and a NYS certified  Computer Specialist as well as trained classroom teachers assist students with media skills. An extensive collection of  computer resource programs is available and we continue to utilize the Imagine Learning English licenses that have been  purchased for our students. Imagine Learning is a program designed specifically to sharpen vocabulary.   ENLs are taught  vocabulary through videos, pictures, glossaries, and direct translations. Words and concepts are repeated in multiple contexts  in various books and activities, which provide students with a rich language experience and deeper understanding.  Each  classroom houses leveled books in various genres to meet the needs of each individual students.  The program highlights both  general academic words and content-specific vocabulary words, so ENLs can use their new vocabulary across the curriculum  throughout the day. Before students read informational leveled texts, key words are clarified and defined in the student’s first  language.  Our state-of-the-art school science lab is furnished with the latest technology equipment. In addition, ENLs enjoy  full access to the school library, which offers an extensive collection of English and Native Language literature as well as  graphic novels for a wide range of reading levels. Teacher generated materials allow for further individualized instruction.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is delivered to our Freestanding ENL program via materials such as bilingual and native language  novels, picture books, bilingual dictionaries, glossaries and a variety of visual aids. ENLs are encouraged to buddy up and  interact with others who speak the same home language and can assist and translate for them when needed.  To ensure home  language support in our current ENL model, a teaching technique that is employed and demonstrated to be beneficial for ENLs,  is to provide them with relevant background  about a topic to be discussed in class, or activate their existing knowledge of a  topic. Apart from increasing student interest, this allows students to focus more fully on the instructional goals, rather than  being overwhelmed with too much new information at once. It also allows ENLs to bridge new knowledge to old knowledge,  increasing understanding, and it aides ENLs to fill in contextual information in the content areas that they may not have due to  coming from different cultural backgrounds.  Bilingual teachers, school aide, and other staff members also interact with  students in their Native Language. As mandated by New York State testing guidelines, ENLs are given the opportunity to use a  translated version of the NYS Math, Science, and Social Studies exams and glossaries. Students who speak and read in a  language that is not one of the translated languages provided by the state are given the opportunity to use a bilingual glossary  published by the Department of Education.                 14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Upon arrival, newly registered ELLs are placed in the appropriate grade according to their age.  P.S. 225 ensures that school  resources such as classroom libraries and computer software are available for the appropriate age and grade level of our ENLs.  All ENL teachers deliver instruction to ENLs in English. Content and language objectives are clearly written for the students and  the students are aware of their individual benchmark goals. Teachers choose content concepts that are age appropriate and  matched to the educational background level of the students. After assessing reading and writing levels, appropriate materials  such as leveled books/libraries are provided to students.  Differentiated instruction is utilized by the classroom teacher  as well  as their ENL teacher.   Teachers also plan meaningful activities that incorporate lesson concepts providing opportunities for  listening, speaking, reading and writing.Teachers identify various ways to assess our students’ progress using data such as,  NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, ENL Periodic Assessments, NYS ELA, NYS Math to identify students’ preferred learning styles, strengths  and weaknesses and individual learning needs.   Students are provided with books in their native language so that their home  language reading skills continue to be fostered.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65           PS 225 shares a building with 771.  All staff takes an interest in the needs of our students.  In order to benefit students in the  areas of academic, linguistic, and socioemotional needs, all sites are print-rich, students have access to grade level text,  libraries, and a focus on Common Core Learning Standards.  Inclusions students from 771 work with ENL teachers within the  general education classrooms in PS 225.  In order to ensure socioemotional needs are being met, students are included within  the general education population for school events including holiday celebrations, parent teacher conferences and open  school.  Technology aids are deployed in every classroom and both visual and hands-on materials are used to support all  students and differentiate instruction.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   To assist newly enrolled ENLs, we encourage them to attend our non-mandated Title III Summer Enrichment Program. This  program is taught by fully licensed ENL teachers. The goal of this program is to improve English language proficiency and  advance content area learning as well as contextualized vocabulary, language development and academic achievement. This  program also offers parental involvement activities.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    At this time, we do not offer any language electives.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Currently, P.S. 225 is using a self contained 50/50 model for the Spanish dual language program in  Kindergarten.  The ELLs and EPs are integrated 100% of the day, (40% are ELLs 60 % are EPs).  All specials  are taught in English.  The classroom teacher provides all instruction in both languages and instuction is  divided by alternating days, (English one day then Spanish the next day etc.).   English language Arts,  Fundations, Guided Reading,  Math, Social Studies, and Science are taught in English on English  days.  They are taught in Spanish on alternate days.  English materials are used on the day English is being  taught and Spanish materials are used the days that Spanish is taught.  Emergent literacy is taught  simultaneously as part of the alternate day schedule.   Students learn alphabet and phonics in both  languages.  Whole group and small group instruction provide opportunites for students to read and  emerge in an equal ratio.       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?    Our professional development plan for staff such as our ENL teachers and our dual language teacher is differentiated and  ongoing throughout the school year.  Due to the large percentage of ELLs, all P.S. 225 teachers are either teachers of ELLs  and/or former ELLs.  Training on scaffolding instruction for ENLs is provided throughout the year to incorporate ENL strategies  in all subject areas.  Additional support is given to enhance differentiated instruction, teaching reading and writing skills,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         transitioning students to English proficiency, aligning classroom rubrics and ENL rubrics together, and working with  newcomers.   ENL teachers collaborate regularly with the teachers whose classes they service to plan for ENL methodologies to  deploy in their lessons that create an environment for language acquisition in their classroom. ENL teachers meet on a regular  basis to discuss the progress of their students and to share instructional strategies and resources.   In addition, P.S. 225s  Professional Development plan will ensure that a designated percentage of PD hours be specific to the needs of our ENLs, co- teaching strategies, and integrated language and content structure.  ENL teachers also attend staff development given by the  Office of English Language Learners (OELL) throughout the year and turnkey to appropriate staff members. These workshops  are provided outside of the school. Many of these workshops focus on developing students’ abilities to read, discuss, and write  academic text in English as part of their rigorous academic instruction.  These workshops are aligned with the Common Core  Learning Standards and designed specifally for ELL students.  Our Professional Development plan will ensure that a designated percentage of PD hours (15% total hours for classroom  teachers and 50% total hours for ENL teachers) be specific to the needs of our ENLs, co-teaching strategies, and integrated  language and content structure.Here is a schedule of ENL training for all staff as per Jose P. with a total of 10 one-hour  sessions:  November 2017 - Kindergarten (How to Scaffold Content Area Vocabulary and Activities for ENLS)  November 2017 - First Grade (How to Scaffold Content Area Vocabulary and Activities for ENLS)  December 2017 - Social Studies K-5 (How to Present Content Area Vocabulary and Activities for ENLS)  December 2017 - Social Studies 6-8 (How to Present Content Area Vocabulary and Activities for ENLs  January 2018 - Science K-2 (How to Present Content Area Vocabulary and Activities for ENLS)  January 2018 - Science 3-5 (How to Present Content Area Vocabulary and Activities for ENLS)  February 2018 - Science 6-8 (How to Present Content Area Vocabulary and Activities for ENLS)  February 2018- Grades K-2 (How to Present Content Area Vocabulary for ENLS)  March  2018 - Grades 3-5 (How to Present Content Area Vocabulary for ENLS)  May  2018 - Grades K-8 new teachers & ENL teachers  (Comprehension at the Core: Scaffolding Literacy Instruction for English  as a New Language students)  June 2018 - Best Practices  In addition, teachers were trained in The Teacher's College reading and writing program and will continue to receive ongoing  training for the next academic year.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  P.S. 225 Professional Development plan will ensure that a designated percentage of PD hours (15% total hours for classroom  teachers and 50% total hours for ENL/dual language teachers) be specific to the needs of our ELLs, co-teaching strategies,  integrated language and content structure.  Each in-house Professional Development is recorded with an attendance sheet  which is filed and kept in the main office.  Along  with attendance, there are specific agendas that specifically state the  Professional Development schedule and targeted topics. -The ENL/dual language staff will model activities for mainstream  personnel during professional periods to ensure that our ELL population is receiving differentiated ENL services throughout the  day.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   P.S. 225 thrives on keeping the lines of communication open with the parents of our students.  After ENL students are  identified at the start of each academic year, the ENL department initiates a meeting with ENL parents.  Every Tuesday from   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67            2:20-3:15, parents are invited to meet with their child's teacher.  They meet individually  to discuss their child's goals, language  development  progress, language proficiency assessment results  and language development needs in all content  areas.  Teachers update parents on the four ENL acquisition stages and how their child is being assessed throughout the year.  Teachers keep conference notes and logs so that they can reflect upon and individualized instruction as needed.  ENL staff,  translators and interpreters are provided to assist in the communication process with parents.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  The ENL teachers meet with the parents or guardians of English language learners at least once a year  to ensure that parents  complete the Parent Survey and Program Selection Form.  Along with meeting the parents of ENLs, ENL teachers are  responsible for keeping copies and documentation for parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations to discuss the  goals of the program, their child’s language development progress,  English language proficiency assessment results, and  language development needs in all content areas.   Our school utilizes the Translation and Interpretation Unit to effectively  communication with parents as well as qualified interpreter/translator.   In addition, ENL parent involvement includes meetings between teachers and ENL parents during extended time which is every  Tuesday throughout the year.  We have also initiated a Saturday Parent Academy.  Parents and their children enrolled in the  school are provided instruction for learning English. It also includes yoga instruction for both parents and students by a trained  ENL teacher.  This program helps ENL parents improve their English skills so that they are better equipped to help their  children with homework and to communicate with their teachers. Parent involvement is a high priority at P.S. 225.  Parents are  continuously encouraged to become actively involved in our school by joining the Parent Teacher Association (PTA). We have  an open door policy which allows parents to communicate with their child’s teacher whenever needed to discuss their child's  needs and to help them grow academically and socially. There are set times for parents to utilize our library media center. This  parent resource program continues to meet the needs of the parents by allowing them to have access to literature and  computer programs especially designed for ENLs.  Our school presented many parent workshops:  Mrs. Pluviose K-2  administrator) and Ms. Demidova (Kindergarten teacher) presented a workshop to parents about Teacher's  College Reading and Writing Workshops for parent's in grades K-2.   Mrs. Trani (our grade 6-8 administrator) and Mrs. Fiore (our guidance counselor)  presented a parent workshop.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Michael Cosmai, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Eileen E.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      P.S. 225 has specific measures to ensure that in case of an emergency, limited-English-proficient families are  contacted. We maintain current records of the primary language of each student and use that information to get  appropriate translation needs as soon as possible, in case of emergency. Student information is kept on file in the  main office, as well as in their classrooms. If the preferred language is not a most prominent covered language, or  there is no staff member in house who can be utilized, then we employ the Over -the -phone Interpretation Services.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Every year the staff of PS 225 receives a handbook with updated pertinent information which includes all Chancellor’s  Regulation including A-663. This handbook must be signed for to ensure that all staff member received a copy. This  handbook can be used as a reference throughout the year. All staff members are made aware of The Department of  Education's Translation and Interpretation Unit through our Language Access Coordinator. Each staff member has  been trained and has access to the Language Access Toolkit. A language welcome poster is displayed in our school  lobby which indicates our LAC (also our Parent Coordinator) contact information. In addition, each staff member has a  copy of the Language Identification Guide. Translation and Interpretation Unit brochures are displayed and available  when needed. Our Language Access Coordinator provides parents with written notification of their rights regarding  translation and interpretation in the languages provided by the Department of Education Office of Interpretation and  Translation Services. We also rely on the over-the-phone interpretation services when needed, along with our in  house translation staff.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Upon entering PS 225, parents are welcomed with signs offering language services which are displayed in our main  lobby and in the office of the parent coordinator. In addition, a language identification card is also displayed in the  main office so parents can identify which languages are available for translation. The card is presented to non English  speaking parents so they can identify to the office staff which language is in need. If the language that is indicated by  the parent is not one that is available by one of our staff members, we employ the services of the over the phone  translation services. At this time, the Department of Education provides translated copies of key documents such as  Entitlement Letters, Placement Letters, Home Language Surveys, Parent Selection Forms, Parent Brochures and a Title  III Supplementary forms. We will also be submitting report cards and promotion in doubt letters for translation into  our seven primary languages. It is the opinion of the ENL team, that once the requested forms are translated, the  parents of our ENL population will be able to receive and understand their children’s status reports. The eight certified  teachers comprising the P.S. 225 ENL team, meet to discuss the interpretation needs of the parents of our targeted  population. After reviewing the current paperwork for each of the students, as well as the Home Language Survey, the  team decides that the following interpretation needs exist;   1. Oral translation for in- house events such as Parent Teacher Conferences, PTA meetings and Open School.   2. Interpretation for IEP and/or referral meetings.   3. Translation services for admissions.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80     Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We at P.S. 225 have a vested interest in our parent feedback. In order to effectively collect parents' thoughts and  opinions, we gather evidence from surveys and request feedback during our open school evenings and parent open  house. Ongoing communication with ELL families during Parent Engagement Tuesdays will be used to gather input  from parents and provide and opportunity for parents to voice their suggestions.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81
