This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   1. Mission Statement   Section 4: CEP Overview      William Alexander Middle School 51 is a diverse community of dedicated administrators, teachers, staff and  concerned parents that strive to create a welcome, nurturing and inclusive environment for students to learn and  grow. William Alexander Middle School 51 welcomes students with a demonstrated ability and willingness to excel.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Teachers encourage high academic standards, the active engagement of students and community involvement. The  school's educational mission is to find a balance between academic challenge and social skill building.   William Alexander Middle School 51 Values:   Social growth, emotional development and respect for oneself and others  Inquiry-based curriculum in which children drive their own learning  In-depth study of one of the arts  Integrating the arts and literacy across all subject areas     High standards for educational excellence            A community in which all members have a voice    After school activities that support all aspects of the curriculum               2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   The MS 51 faculty and administration continue to engage in collaborations with Teachers College Reading and Writing  Project, Brooklyn North Field Support Center, Restorative Justice, Border Crossers, Urban Advantage, and the  Gowanus Canal Conservancy for professional teacher and curriculum development. Our Diversity, Unity and Equity  Team (DUET) will play a key role in revising the school's mission statement, in collaboration with the School  Leadership Team. That mission will continue to communicate our objective to provide all students with an in depth  study of the arts, accelerated curriculum in all subjects, including second language, and social emotional support  structures, to develop the whole child. These strategic partnerships and structures support our goals around rigorous  instruction, supportive environment, collaborative teachers and effective school leadership, as noted in the  Framework for Great Schools.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   A special initiative being implemented this year for our special needs population is to expand the Skills for Success  Summer Bridge Program by enrolling more students. In the past, students who participated in the program had an  easier transition into middle school and earned higher report card averages and benchmark exams in English  Language Arts (ELA) than the students with Individual Educational Plans (IEPs) who did not attend the program. As our  special education population increases, this program becomes even more important and is supported by our parent  association.    Our SWD also need to develop academic and personal behaviors that support classroom learning and college and  career readiness. Developing trust and compassion with their teachers and classmates are vital to this work. To that  end, we are investing time and resources to implement restorative justice practices in classrooms with SWD to build  community and to better support the social-emotional needs of these students and reduce behaviors that result in  suspension.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our school has made progress in Supportive Environment, understanding how our community must evolve to be  more inclusive academically, socially and emotionally, to meet the needs of our very diverse learning community. We  have started piloting restorative circles in many classrooms and strategic feedback in all subject areas. Our   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      professional development has focused on these two areas to improve achievement, while supporting social- emotional growth.   However, as our special education population continues to increase, we need to continue to develop strategies that  help all students develop academic and personal behaviors that support learning. Our key focus this year will continue  to be on Supportive Environment and how we can better support our teachers professionally so that they have the  skills, strategies, plans and confidence to support our diverse learners, especially in the increasing number of  Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) classrooms.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 15K051   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1136   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Strengths:    Our overarching support structure of one administrator and one guidance counselor overseeing a cohort of students  over three years has been successful in guiding families and students through the middle school years and high school  articulation. [As per 2016-2017 School Quality Snapshot Supportive Environment score: Excellent and school survey  score of 95% in Guidance category). Our score for Safety is 91%, which reflects our safe, happy and focused learning  environment.   Led by the student government and the grade leaders, monthly Character Education Assemblies support a diverse  school culture that is safe, respectful and inclusive (Respect for All school Awarded 2014). This past year, the student  government executive council led assemblies on sexual harassment, bullying and gun control. They also led our  student body of over 1130 in a very impressive, silent walk-out to honor the victims of gun violence and to protest  current gun control laws.   A school health clinic provides an additional full-time social worker to our staff of three guidance counselors and a  SBST, consisting of a family worker, 1 day-a-week social worker and a school psychologist.    Our school attends to the needs of all students and offers a rich array of electives in the arts as well as a welcoming  culture to its expanding special needs population and to all students. Our intensive Arts program, after school  programming and clubs (such as Stand for the Silent, Affinity Groups, Gay-Straight Alliance Club, Culture Club, and  Morning Announcers) gives our diverse population of students, additional academic and social supports beyond the  regular school day. This year we introduced professional development for Restorative Justice Practices.    Priority Needs:    With an increase in our special education student population from 4 to 5 ICT incoming classes and 2 self-contained  incoming classes, we need to continue to expand our social-emotional supports to help students with IEPs meet the  high academic expectations of MS 51. Supports will continue to include the Skills for Success Summer Bridge Program,  before and after school AIS, and the Respect for All assembly programming. To address the survey results of 82% in  the Social-Emotional category, we will pilot Restorative Justice Practices in the ICT classes, to build community and  reduce antisocial behaviors of SWD, who are disproportionately suspended (SWD account for 80% of suspensions). To  address the survey results of 66% in Personal Attention and Support, we need to provide teachers more time to meet  and plan to expand the range of strategies and supports for students in special education classes so that all teachers  are highly skilled in addressing individual student needs on a more personal level. We also need to train  paraprofessionals on supporting behavior plans and collecting BIP data in the classroom.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Strengths:   Our seasoned staff has worked collaboratively and consistently to develop a CCLS-aligned curriculum and assessments  in each subject area. To that end, we have developed common rubrics throughout the school to deepen the work  towards better transference of knowledge, especially in persuasive writing. Last year we worked on streamlining  Inquiry Team protocols during teacher team meetings with the support of our Field Support Center to help teachers  understand that grade level achievement is a shared responsibility. We also introduced new technology applications,  such as IO Education/PupilPath, Google Classroom and Mastery Connect, and created a vision for technology at MS51  that would improve overall communication within the school community. Our science grade teams created authentic  exit projects around the Gowanus Canal Conservancy mission of cleaning the canal and providing solutions for water  run-off in our neighborhood. They also started an after school program with the Billion Oyster Project, as an  additional, natural way to clean the Canal. In addition to these collaborative initiatives, we introduced a new  instructional focus, Strategic Feedback, as well as Restorative Circles, and began to share our action research after a  year of professional development and piloting new tools and strategies in these areas.   Priority Needs:   To address the school survey score of 71% in Innovation and Collective Responsibility, we need to democratize the  knowledge of best practices in the use of our new instructional focus, Strategic Feedback, (provide students with  powerful, strategic feedback during classroom conferring time) and Restorative Circles, through co-planning, lesson  sharing - “watching-others-work” (WOW), and school-wide, teacher-led professional development. Our veteran staff  can partner with our newest teachers to share well-developed pedagogy and incorporate new, innovative practices.  Teachers can develop inquiry teams or committees around problems of practice and use their classrooms for action  research using our Watching Others Work protocols. After careful analysis of the Student Perception survey, we are  charged with getting students more engaged in conversations with peers and teachers to help build more trusting  teacher-student and student-student relationships and create a classroom climate that feels more student-centered.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.  By June 2019, teachers in all grades will participate in a WOW cycle for Strategic Feedback, Restorative Circles and/or  Behavior Plans, to support implementation of these initiatives, as measured by a 2% increase in the Pedagogical  Effectiveness, Classroom Engagement and Classroom Climate scores on the Student Perception Survey.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          24     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Strengths:   My role as school leader to bring initiatives to the school each year is based on changes in the real world. Over the  years we have successfully been involved in initiatives that are important to our community, such as improving  technology and communication with parents, enhancing or advancing curriculum, developing inquiry teams and  distributive leadership, and implementing teacher committees for school improvement. In the most recent Survey  results, Effective School Leadership score was steady at 3.83 (+0.15 compared to the district and +0.25 compared to  the City average), with scores ranging from 88% to 94% positive in the categories of Inclusive Leadership, Instructional  Leadership, Program Coherence, and Teacher Influence).   Priority Needs:   To address the Inclusive Leadership score of 88%, I will continue to invite teachers to form committees around school  improvement areas, so that they have a voice in how our school evolves and improves each year. To better prepare  the entire school community for the upcoming District 15 Diversity Plan recommendations, we need to develop a  more inclusive MS 51 Mission statement to embrace these changes. We hope to develop an MS 51 mission that  reflects how we strive to support the needs of students at all academic levels, embrace students from all over the  district, and ensure that students from every demographic feel connected, included and equal to their peers - this  includes parents, as well. Any changes to our mission and student population must be firmly supported by teacher  professional development and the DOE, in terms of funding students with special needs, smaller class size, anti-bias  and culturally responsive curriculum training, and paraprofessional training.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, expand the Diversity, Unity and Equity Team (DUET) membership to include students, teachers, and  parents, who will develop a set of recommendations to update the school's mission statement in alignment with the  new district 15 Diversity Plan, as measured by the completion of a new MS 51 mission statement, in collaboration with  the SLT.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          27     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Strengths    Our talent program is one of the best in NYC, featuring 6 art forms. Students select their talent and enjoy an in depth  study in one art over three years. Parents enjoy seeing performances, art displays and concerts several times  throughout the year. Many talented parents also offer their services to support the arts back stage with technical  assistance or professional contributions to the class. Many organizations support our work in the neighborhood by  buying ad space in our programs, donating food for concessions, displaying student-created art in the community, or  hosting events that raise funds for the school.    The MS 51 student government has engaged in real social action this year with Councilmember Brad Lander in  Participatory Budgeting Youth Council, Vision Zero lobbying in Albany, and two Gun Control walk-outs to protest  current gun control laws. Our student government was directly involved in communications at City Hall to lobby for  #TooHotToLearn air conditioning for all NYC DOE classrooms.   Our Parent Association, along with our Parent Coordinator, help structure a robust calendar of events for parent  engagement and involvement including monthly meetings, School Leadership Team (SLT), Diversity Committee  (DUET), parent workshops, movie nights, house parties, curriculum night and conferences, auctions, spring 'blow-out'  on the turf, volunteerism on trips and talent show help, library help, community book reads, and grade specific  meetings for the high school application process. Our SLT helped develop our new student-led conference structure in  March that includes parent-sign ups, student ambassadors and presentations by the PA and Principal to better engage  parents in the process of student goal-student, progress monitoring, and teacher to parent communication. We enjoy  robust parent engagement in our school, particularly at PA friend-raisers, fundraisers, and talent productions.    The most recent Survey data suggests that Strong Family-Community Ties - Outreach to Parents score rose by 4%  points from 82% to 86% in one year.    Priority Needs    While our parents are involved in supporting the arts, special events and academics, they also want to be involved in  social-emotional discussions and parenting workshops. Parents have requested that we communicate details about  each Respect for All Assembly, as many topics would simultaneously support parenting and school goals, as well as  improve parent outreach and parent involvement in school and at Parent Association Meetings. We could create  parallel workshops on the same topics, one student-facing and one for the parent workshop. Topics should cover  cyber-bullying, school safety, diversity, pedestrian safety, social media, citizenship, and mental health, to name a few.  These parent workshops could improve attendance at our PA meetings as well, increasing our Parent Involvement in  School and Outreach to Parents scores on the survey.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          31     Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40     State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of  this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school.  William Alexander MS 51 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible  for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team,  Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   William Alexander MS 51 will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses the TCRWP assessment tool and start the year with a reading response baseline assessment.  Historically and  currently we have found reading levels of ELLs to be below grade level and that their writing skills are weakest in grammar and  spelling conventions, in general.  Even our former ELLs struggle with these same issues, but at a much more proficient  level.  This data indicates that ELLs are weakest in reading and writing, therefore our instructional plan focuses on addressing  these weaknesses while reinforcing strengths in other skills. Our instructional plan includes assistance from our ENL teacher, in  some cases our IEP teacher, and small group tutoring after school.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We use Mastery Connect to analyze the assessment data within the ELA and ENL department.  We also use periodic  assessments for the NYSESLAT to gather baseline data and monitor benchmark progress.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Students making progress on the NYSESLAT is evidence of success in the ENL program.  Also making AYP in math and ELA for  the SWD subgroup is evidence of progress for our ELL students. ENL program success is measured by students advancing one  level per year on the NYSESLAT until reaching the Commanding level. Should students not advance a level per year, success is  also measured by advancing on any one or more of the four NYSESLAT modalities. Additionally, we use ELL Periodic  Assessments.               4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We use report card grades and NYSESLAT periodic assessments to re-evaluate the need for interventions and the types of  interventions for increased student achievement.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Not applicable because we are grades 6-8.        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   According to  NYSESLAT results from 2015-2017,  the overwhelming majority of our ELLs are long-term ELLs who continue  developing but have generally plateaued, scoring as either Transitioning or Expanding.  Our ELL population is also comprised  exclusively (with a single exception) of special education students with disabilities.  Across all grades, the reading, writing and  listening modality scores were lowest, as compared to speaking. New admits given NYSITELL have all scored at the  Commanding level (with the single exception of a general education student at the Expanding level). Cross-referencing shows  that ELLs also scored 1 or 2 on the ELA until they tested out of ENL, generally in the same year.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?    All but one ENL student are students with disabilities, requiring 12:1 and ICT settings, with additional supports as per their  IEPs.   Our ELL students are also programmed for AIS periods to provide additional reading and writing supports.  Special  education and ICT teacher teams reinforce the language, reading and writing skills taught in ENL class and work collaboratively  with the ENL teacher.  ELLs with speech services are also supported with additional reading, writing and speaking services.  All  of these teachers and service providers have access to the assessment data to inform their instruction.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Instruction is delivered in stand-alone ENL classes and during push-in periods when the students have ELA or Social Studies in either self-contained or ICT classes, with occasional pull-outs. Students are grouped by grade and  travel together in a block as a heterogeneous class of mixed proficiency levels. Instruction is delivered in English. As  outlined in CR154.2, required instructional minutes are divided according to proficiency levels.             b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      c.  DL program.  If applicable.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Students at the Entering, Emerging and Transitional proficiency levels receive six hours (360 minutes) of service each week,  while Expanding students receive three hours (180 minutes) of service per week. The teacher continues to push into these  student’s classes at least twice a week in addition to stand-alone ENL classes. Former ELLs (those who scored at the  Commanding level) are permitted to have testing accommodations for up to two years after testing out on the NYSESLAT and  also receive 90 minutes of ENL service per week.                3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   The goal of our ENL program is to promote full English proficiency in a supportive classroom environment. In order to help  students to progress, we utilize the following practices:  •Collaborative planning between ENL and ELA teachers for each unit.  •Scaffolding is an essential part of the instructional delivery, such as Modeling, Bridging, Schema Building, Contextualization,  Text Representation and Metacognition.  • Assisting students during work periods, conferencing with students in and out of class, informal assessments, and running  records.  •Additional small group AIS sessions for each grade prior to all state assessments, to focus on literacy and academic language.  Beyond explicit ENL, collaboration between teachers means that there is a consideration for the language needs of ELLs. Some  aspects of this policy include:   •Content area teachers monitor the understanding of linguistically challenging material and use a variety of phrasings and  synonyms to clarify meaning.  •Math teachers devote extra class time to untangling difficult word problems, and require students to make verbal  explanations of the problems they work on.  •Social Studies teachers scaffold their instruction with visual aids such as maps, atlases, and illustrations to increase  comprehension.   •Math and ELA Inquiry Teams focused on teaching content language, word study and vocabulary this year to increase reading  comprehension.     Instructional Materials:      The Freestanding ENL program does not use a particular text, but works within our GE ELA instruction with the support of  Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Workshop Model, aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. Additionally, ELLs  are given home language dictionaries and glossaries for use in class and on high-stakes testing and projects. Should translators  or interpreters be needed in the classroom on the rare occasion, in-school staff or parent volunteers are used. This includes  the use of high interest / low level ‘leveled’ texts with frequent assessments in reading level growth. The exception to this  pattern is where materials are used to familiarize students with the state assessments, including:  I.    Getting Ready for the New NYSESLAT  II.   New York State Coach: ELA  III.  New York State Coach: Mathematics  IV. Academic Vocabulary Toolkit  V. Finish Line Reading/Writing/New York ELLs     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   ELLs in our Free Standing ENL program are not evaluated in their native language except for administration of the Spanish LAB  as required.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. We currently have no students identified as SIFE students.  If we did we would provide the following:  •An individualized student needs assessment for students in each program model.    •An AIS plan for the student with a focus on the literacy, with a math component, based on ENL teacher assessment of ELLs in  conjunction with the after school AIS program for support in ELA and Math.  •Age-appropriate scaffolded instructional support materials in the classroom, as implemented by ENL teacher and classroom  teacher.  Scaffolds include graphic organizers, manipulatives, dictionaries, word walls, and small group learning. These  strategies are used in all classrooms within each program model. Testing accommodations for former ELLs continue with time  and a half.    •Staff will receive professional development in the ALD assessment to identify SIFE students as needed and in strategies that  benefit the SIFE within classroom instruction.  d. Developing and long-term ELLs are the largest number of ELLs across the grades. An analysis of their scores on the  NYSESLAT, ELA and Math assessments suggests that their problem is one of reading and writing, which coincides with their  Special Education status. Our action plan for this group involves.  An after school program, targeting reading and writing three days during the week.   Monitoring the progress of students in all content areas to differentiate instruction for literacy needs.  e. Former ELLs receive 90 minutes of mandated services for up to two years after exiting ELL status. All ELLs receive extended  time and separate location for all high-stakes testing, while former ELLs receive these same accommodations for up to two  years after exiting ELL status.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Universal Design for Learning is a structure used by all teachers at MS 51. We also ensure teachers of students with an IEP are  familiar with students’ particular needs and all services are provided according to the IEP mandates.  Materials include graphic  organizers, manipulatives in math, audiovisual aides, and scaffolded questions.  •    Collaboration between the ENL teacher and IEP contact person.  •    Monitoring newcomer students for possible special needs status.  •    The delivery of AIS enrichment services after school and Wilson as per their IEP.

(Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development plan includes our ENL teacher attending ELLs meetings specific to ELLs instruction, including the  scoring training for the NYSESLAT.  City wide offerings for ELL PD are also made available to our teachers each month from the  office of bilingual education.  ELLs teachers also attend ELA CCLS trainings and PD that are offered in school through Teachers  College, Columbia University staff development.  Our mandatory ELLs training takes place during our conference days and is  embedded in our literacy staff development from TC.  The focus continues to be on the CCLS and the strategies used to make  the reading and writing more accessible to our ELL and SWD.  Special education teachers, who have all of our ELL students,  spend an additional 3 hours in a UDL training. Related service professionals including ENL teacher also attend testing meetings  each year for testing and scoring compliance. PDs and workshops for staff in all content areas will be offered over the school  year and will be facilitated by the ELL Coordinator or outside ELL resources; the calendar is to be determined. Percentages of  PDs and workshops set aside for ELL needs will meet all regulations outlined in CR154.2.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Guidance meets with both students and the ENL teacher together to make the transition smooth. The ENL teacher is in active  communication with content area teachers to ensure everyone is aware of the needs of ELLs. Guidance counselors attend city  wide offerings related to transitioning of ELLs as such PDs are made available.  Agendas and attendance records of PDs are  kept by the administration. PDs both in-house and off-site are made available to all staff through a weekly staff newsletter  from the principal. The required percentages for PDs, including 15% of total PD hours for ELL-specific PDs for all teachers and  50% of of total PD hours for ELL-specific PDs for bilingual educations/ENL teachers, are set aside as needed and staff are  encouraged to attend other PDs off-site. In-school PDs and city-wide offerings to meet CR 154.2 make up the required  percentages, but it is left to staff to register for and  track their mandated hours. Agendas and attendance for all in-house PDs  are kept by the principal.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our ELL parent member volunteers in the school, working with the parent coordinator and the office staff. We have a very  strong, supportive PTA which holds monthly parent meetings, parent workshops, and several fundraisers for the school  throughout the year. Our Teachers College staff developers offer reading and writing parent workshops once year at school  and once at Columbia University. At our 6th grade orientation, all parents complete a survey to better understand how the  school can support their language needs. Throughout the year we conduct several Open Houses to orient parents, potluck  dinners to informally meet parents, parent workshops and meetings and several opportunities for parents to volunteer in the  school, on field trips, at talent productions, and fundraisers.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   MS51 William Alexander                                                                              School DBN: 15K051  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Our pupil personnel secretary, Assistant Principal and parent coordinator work with PTA volunteers to assess the  interpretation needs of our school community. In addition to the ATS/biographical information and pertinent  parts of the HLIS, PTA meetings include an outreach to our new/incoming parents by asking them to complete a  needs assessment/parent volunteer form and we provide translators to help complete the assessment. We  continue this outreach into the first half of the fall term by repeating this event at the first few PTA meetings.  These parents who have translation needs are documented and are often contacted not only to participate in  school events, but to contribute to our translation efforts by volunteering to translate for other parents. When  parents enter the school, the main office and the parent coordinator's office, they are greeted by prominently  displayed multilingual language service assistance welcome posters, identification guides and cards to allow them  to indicate their preferred language of communication.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59     2.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Parents in need of translation and interpretation services are provided with a copy of the Bill of Rights and  Responsibilities which includes their rights regarding translation and interpretation services during orientation and as  needed. A sign is posted at the entrance of our school stating (in the most prominent covered languages) availability  of interpretation services. In the beginning of the year, the Department of Education discipline code book is  distributed in several languages to our families. Progress report card information, parent-teacher conference/open  house/event invitations, and health information (SUNY/LICH clinic) is also communicated in these prominent  languages. We use notification documents that can be found at the Translation and Interpretation Unit’s intranet site  as necessary.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62     Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Our parent coordinator distributes parent feedback surveys. School leadership and staff are also always receptive to  individual requests from parents or students for any service needs, whether from individual in-person meetings,  phone calls, written or email communications and act to accommodate the needs of ENL families to the best of our  ability. We schedule a focus group of parents inclusive of all cultures and languages represented in our school to  gather feedback and best practices on communicating with families.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63
