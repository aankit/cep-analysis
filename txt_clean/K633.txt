This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our mission is to engage students in the academic rigor needed to guarantee a quality education for all children  ranging from those who struggle to learn to the most gifted. Partnerships with selected members of the health and  pharmaceutical industries will provide additional support such as internships, professional development and other  available resources to further assist our school in preparing graduates to excel in their post-secondary education and  chosen career.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The High School for Medical Professions (HSMP) is a thematic high school located in Brooklyn that is designed for  students interested in exploring and preparing for a career in the health care and/or pharmaceutical field. All students  who attend HSMP will develop the critical and creative thinking skills necessary to graduate college and learn  necessary professional skills in health related fields. Students will succeed both academically and socially through the  implementation of our integrated curriculum and core values known as H.S.M.P (Healthy, Scholarly, Mindful, and  Professional).    Our primary partners are Brookdale Medical Center, S.U.N.Y Downstate, Maimonides , and Global Kids. In addition,  we have partnerships with over one hundred additional medical and social service facilities.   Our student-focused program of studies fosters the academic and personal excellence necessary to meet or exceed  state and Common Core standards as well as to promote productive members of society who respect diversity, value  differences and demonstrate the ability to adapt and prosper in the ever-changing world around them.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our school serves English as a new language learners (ENL) and students with disabilities. Our special student  populations are provided with access to the general education curriculum with the appropriate supports to address  their specific language and learning needs outlined in individualized ENL action plans and Individualized Education  Plans (IEPs) developed in collaboration by all members of the teaching and related service staff.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   (E:1)Rigorous Instruction: Students continue to progress with argumentative and expository writing with the  incorporation of the Hochman Writing Method in all content areas as well as CCLS aligned unit summative  performance tasks as evidenced by the increase in essay scores on the social studies and English regents exams.  Humanities teachers incorporated more grade level informational texts in units of study with the appropriate  scaffolding to meet the needs of struggling readers. More students had the opportunity to take AP classes with the  addition of Environmental Science and World History classes as well as college classes with a partnership with Long  Island University.   ( Progress through the addition of Hochman Method writing skills across the school improved complexity of students  writing and response in all content areas (including math and science, as evidenced of a 5% increase in short response  and essay writing assessments on M.O.S.L. growth).    (E:2)Supportive Environment: Our partnership with Center for Court Innovation as well as trained HSMP staff  members in Restorative Justice has provided the platform to strengthen school community and establish shared  values as evidenced by the incorporation of Restorative Circles in the 9th grade Civics curriculum and the continued  decrease in student suspensions. The scheduling of integrated co-teaching classes exposes students to grade level  curricula with necessary support systems to provide a safe learning environment for all students. We also have staff  members trained in Therapeutic Crisis Intervention Supports.

Focus for next year:    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Rigorous Instruction: (E:2)Supportive environment – Positive Behavior Intervention Supports initiative in collaboration  with a behavioral specialist will be continued with weekly meeting times – a set time, team, and monthly agendas.   PBIS: Team consisting of principal, teacher staff, community support staff, students, and community based  organizations.    (E:3)Collaborative Teachers – Teachers will establish at the start of the year a culture of improvement through a  revised intervention schedule, sharing of weaknesses and strengths, and sharing of professional development by all  teachers. This will be facilitated by the peer collaborative coaches, Professional Development Plan, grade team and  department leaders. Evidence of this will be tracked through meeting minutes, binders, Google surveys, and reflection  during whole staff PDs.    (E:4) Effective Leadership – Our school will incorporate a teacher leader position, Peer Collaborative Coach and/or  Classroom Model. In the 2018/2019 school year, we will have 1 peer-collaborative coach who will work with staff to  improve instructional planning so that it is differentiated for all learners. This peer leader will work with staff  throughout the year during PD’s, inter-visitations, grade team meetings, and coaching/mentoring one-on-one.    (E:5) Strong Family and Community Ties – Our focus for next year is to improve communication with families by  providing school newsletters that are distributed six times per year to inform families of events that our students had  the opportunity to participate in and inform them of upcoming events. It is also our goal to have more families  register for PupilPath to stay abreast of students' academic and socio-emotional progress and to communicate with  teachers throughout the school year. Lastly, our school website will provide a calendar of events while allowing  students and their families access to curricular materials.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 18K633   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   424   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     ELA/CCLS Literacy Skills: Students show strength in argumentative writing, through the close reading and  identification of claims and distinguishing them from opposing claims in informational texts. Students show weakness  in narrative and poetic literature as evidence of confusion with reading comprehension questions dealing with  figurative language, thematic analysis, and author’s writing techniques. Strengths include highly differentiated  assignments and close collaboration between general education and special education teachers to provide  instructional materials that meet the needs of all learners.   Trend/ Weakness: Student performance on Common Core ELA multiple choice had mixed results/and is in direct  opposition to their strengths and improvement in writing, as per results of multiple choice ELA common core in  comparison with the above standards and marks on the M.O.S.L. exams across all grade levels. There is need for  improved stamina and comprehension of higher lexile texts, in order strengthen the alignment of our ELA curriculum  with the College and Career readiness levels in the CCLS. Our goal is to increase the college level rate for students  scoring a 75 or higher from 66% to 70% on the ELA Regents.   Math/Science: These content areas will support literacy growth in Humanities areas through instructional  development and implementing the Hochman Simple Writing Skills into the daily lesson activities and summative  assessments.       Trend/Weakness The lack of informational texts used in the math and science classrooms, and a focus on strict  content based information, often coming from teachers disseminating that information. In the 2018/2019 school  year, there needs to be more of a student centered inquiry based approach to math and science problems, as this will  in turn improve CCLS standard alignment and CCLS Regents based scores at the end of the year.    Classroom Observation Data Yields : Discussion-based lessons in humanities that challenge students to articulate  their understanding of complex topics. Word walls are displayed in all content areas classrooms, marking period  summative assessments use a project based learning approach that allows for student choice and higher level  thinking.    Hochman writing allows students to use language that expresses understanding.   Area of need:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      - More benchmark assessments, pre and post tests for every unit.    - More interdisciplinary curriculum coherence.    - Improved in class formative assessment practices that yield demonstration of learning mid-lesson or before leaving  the classroom.   - An increase in independent grade level informational reading in the math and science classrooms.   - Increased use of consistent discussion protocols and language to yield increased vocabulary and promotion of  student inquiry and reflection.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  HSMP faculty and partners understand the challenges faced in supporting the individual needs of all learners and  pledge as a school community to provide each child with the personalized attention necessary to reach their  educational potential and emotional maturity. Our plan of action will include an academic assessment for each  student, unique learning opportunities, direct and consistent involvement with our collaborating partners and a  comprehensive school community service project. Students will succeed both academically and socially through the  implementation of our integrated curriculum and core values known as H.S.M.P (Healthy, Scholarly, Mindful, and  Professional), which we have begun to integrate through a positive behavioral intervention systems culture.    The first phase of the PBIS program was rolled out two years ago and some structures are in place that can be  followed through on next year. What is needed to strengthen and improve upon the work we started is a set schedule  of meetings, which will included a team of teachers, students (elected and volunteer), admin, and continued principal  participation.    Another next step of PBIS will be a peer mediation/conflict resolution system taking place between students to help  resolve problems. In addition, this school year we will have a person from the Center for Court Innovation's  Participatory Peace Circles (PPC) program working at our school full-time. After school clubs, tutoring, and Saturday  school help build social and academic skills.   Areas of need:    Increase conflict resolution measures and instruction regarding social and emotional development through our P.B.I.S.  initiatives of tier 1 and tier 2 teams. Tier 2 teams are small groups of staff (deans, community support, and teachers)  who are focused on small group to individual at risk students.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34       Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. High School for Medical Professions, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students  High School for Medical Professions will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The HSMP ENL Program aims to assist students to become proficient in the English language after at least 3 years.  Evaluation  is continuous and collaborative.   Students are assessed using running records and an item analysis is conducted on each of  their Regents exams to identify their areas of weakness.  The NYSESLAT results is used for the end of year analysis, the  examination provides information on the students’ ability in the four language skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing)  as well as their overall level (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding), as well as DRA, TCRWP, and  teacher created materials.  Based on the results of the NYSESLAT, the ELL students fall mostly within the transitioning and  expanding levels.  Also, data as listed above informs that the ELL students' greatest strengths are listening and speaking and  the areas of focus are reading and writing.  We have shown NYSESLAT progress in the tested areas for all of our students.  Based on our analysis, we have focused our program on the modalities of writing and reading, stressing cross-curricular  planning,  close reading and analysis  of informational texts, and increased writing across all content areas.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Evaluation is based on meeting AYP and graduation rates and by classroom assessment to provide individualized support.   We consider AYP and in analyzing data, comparing NYSITELL and prior NYSESLAT scores, as well as ELA regents scores, in order  to see see that all students are making significant gains.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We have implemented the following best practices based on the data:  Rigorous targeting of the language skills, especially that of reading and writing in ENL and the content areas through  implementation of the Hochman Writing Method and close reading of informational texts.  Close collaboration between the ENL teacher and content area teachers on identifying and correcting specific deficiencies in  individual students.  NYSITELL results are used to place students of similar ability levels in the classroom. The NYSITELL DATA shows that our  students excel in the area of listenting and struggle with reading and writing.   Use of ENL dictionaries (Longmans Dictionary), and glossaries in a print-rich classroom environment.  After school tutoring  Academic intervention as required to foster students’ academic development and progress.    Thorough practice in problem-solving strategies and justifying answers in mathematics.  Providing opportunities for negotiating academic language in all content areas through student based discussions aligned to  speaking and listening skills of the CCLS.  All subsequent support activities will focus on helping the students acquire progress in their language skills so as to promote  academic progress.  Students who have reached the level of proficiency at the NYSESLAT and so have transitioned out of the ESL program will  continue to receive Regents testing accommodations for such as extra time, testing in a separate location, and use of  glossaries and dictionaries.  This will continue for as long as the students need such accommodations, but for not more than an  additional two years.    Those who continue to need services, generally shown as a need in reading and writing, continue to receive services as  proscribed.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Workshops are held with families.            Part IV: ELL Programming     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   TThe number of ELL students is relatively small (08 students ranging from Grade 9 to Grade 12).  We have primarily  adopted the Inclusion model with collaborative team teaching and/or push-in of ESL and SETSS teachers in all of our  classrooms. Each of our grades has one section where the ELL and former ELL's travel together for much of the  day.  The program is a stand-alone ENL model, where the students have ENL as their program, as opposed to TBE or  dual language. They are programmed in a block, with classes travelling in a group throgh the day. Students are  grouped by age and ability.  This programming provides the ESL students with the mandated number of minutes as  stated in New York State Chancellor's Regulations Part 154.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                 The instruction and distribution of time for compliance to CR Part 154 for ELL students will be achieved in the following  ways:    •  Dedicated ESL teacher who pushes-in, pulls-out, and follows groups of ELL students within their general education  classrooms.   •  Programming Special Needs ELLs in Integrated co-teaching classrooms.  •  Collaborative planning between the ESL and content area teachers.  Emerging and Transitioning students are scehdule for a minimum of seven 50 minute periods,  Expanding students scheduled  for four periods.  At this time we have no Emerging students.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.         Use of SmartBoards and other technology in each classroom.  Scaffolding instructional delivery, e.g. modeling, bridging, contextualization, schema building, meta-cognitive development,  and text representation, through activities like Reading with a Purpose, Reaching a Consensus, Think-Pair-Share,  Compare/Contrast Matrix, Sequence of Events Chain, Re-imaging the Text, and so on.  Daily conferencing between ENL and content area teachers on challenging material and to scaffold concepts and skills in order  to increase comprehension.  Coplanned lessons to align with CCLS  Use of bilingual and ENL dictionaries and glossaries in the content area and ENL classrooms to ensure native language  support.  Translated content area instructional materials when appropriate.  Conferencing with ELLs in and out of classroom.  Assessment through formal and informal assessments, and running records in alignment with CCLS  Use of a variety of high interest texts, vocabulary, listening and speaking activities as well as free and guided writing exercises  aligning with CCLS.  Use of material to familiarize ELLs with the state assessments format, e.g. Empire State NYSESLAT (Continental Press)and prior  regents exams.  Extended time opportunities for students such as after-school classes in content area classes.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46       AIS through use or a reading and writing program (Really Great Reading and Hochman Writing Method)  in alignment with  CCLS     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?         Content is delivered in English with instructional materiasl providing native language support.   The ESL teacher is trained in  QTEL strategies and he plans with his collaborative teachers to infuse these strategies in lesson planning and  delivery.   Multiple staff memb mbers, including our ESL teacher, are fluent in our students' native languages.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    All students are assessed to ensure that their individual needs are being met using data from the NYSESLAT to determine the  number of units that are required for instruction to support ELL's in the different subgroup areas. For students who have  tested proficient, they are provided with the support of additional time and readings of materials as required by law.   A.  Adapting and scaffolding the curricula that is alinged to CCLS help to support SIFE students as well as outreach to parents in  order to collaborate appropriate supports for the student. These students are offered more minutes and levelled materials.   B.  Students who are newcomers are welcomed in and assessed through NYSITELL. In addition, if necessary, we begin with the  native language and continue to teach vocabulary and syntax. From there, the students are placed in ENL classes   C.  Devleoping ELLs are given instruction support in ENL classes, primarily in reading and writing, as those are the primary areas  of need.  D.  Long-term ELLs in our school are either students with special needs or students with low attendance. We hae an  instructional support staff that does parent outreach daily for truant students and our teachers co-plan and co-teach to  provide support for ELL SWD students.   E. Former ELLs are grouped with current ELLs in order to maintain support, and continue to be provided ELL modifications.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The ENL teacher uses QTEL strategies throughout instruction along with the use of high interest low level reading material,  such as the Buford High series, to support literacy.  Student reading levels are assessed and instructional materials are  provided with lexile levels that support the increased access to information and scaffold reading ability with the use of  resources like NEWS ELA.  Materials are researched and provided to students, with a focus on informational texts. In order to accommodate needs, we  find levelled texts related to the story issue. The ensures that students at all levels and SWD-ELL students have access to the  material. All information is all available on computer and/or displayed on the smartboard.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL-SWD have goals in their IEP that tailor instruction to their individual needs. We use a push-in model to ensure that the  students are provided with the least restrictive environment. We encourage interaction with their peers and allow for pull-outs  when necessary. Also, tutoring and ninth period classes are options for students. If a student is identified as an ENL-SWD, he or  she is placed in an ICT class. From there, students may be pulled out as part of a group or remain in the class, depending on the  day’s lesson.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Intervention is determined upon reviewing data and determining what individual needs are, For example, we provide some  students with SETSS support to enhance the instruction they are receiving. All lessons are co-planned and for SWD-ELLs, we   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      use the ICT model.  In addtion, we offer tutoring in each subject after school each day which is delivered in English. Depending  on the subgroup, SIFE, 0-3 years, 4-6 years, 6+ years, or students who tested out within a two year period.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We will continue to implement the Hochman Writing Method as well as introduce the phonics program Really Great Reading,  since we have seen improvement in student writing and are hoping to expand to reading.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We are not discontinuing any programs or services for our students.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded the same access to school programs as other students.  Academic tutoring, clubs, and sporting activities are  offered to all students including ELLs.  Information is posted on-line or in hallways. Currently, we have ELLs in clubs, tutoring,  and athletics.  ENL students are represented in tutoring and on school sports teams.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We use a high level of visual support with our ELL students and have translated versions of instructional materials when  possible. We retain the services of a community organization, Puppetry in Practice, in order to provide additional support. We  also subscribe to www.castlelearning.com which speaks text to students.  All students, including SIFE, SWD, and LTE ELLs are  given equal opportunity to participate.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is delivered with supplemental instructional materials, such as Spellman and Longman texts,  continued reading and access series.  Native language text is available and the ENL teacher speaks one of the native languages  (Spanish) of ELL students in the school.  HSMP only offers ENL.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Service supports are differentiated based on individual student needs, ages, and levels.  HSMP chooses materials that are low  level and high interest.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We use a high level of visual support with our ELL students and have translated versions of instructional materials when  possible. We retain the services of a community organization, Puppetry in Practice, in order to provide additional support. We  also subscribe to www.castlelearning.com which speaks text to students.  All students, including SIFE, SWD, and LTE ELLs are  given equal opportunity to participate.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   We do not currently have a bridge program but offer inforamation about programs in the community to families. We provide  this outreach in order to ease the transition. Students are able to come to visit, as we have an open campus policy. Students  are given every opportunity to fully integrate into the community via extracurricular activities. This actiivities are monitored by  teachers, coaches, and administrative staff.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish is offered to all students.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development is provided to the ELL teacher using an educational consultant once per week, daily professional  periods and weekly grade team meetings with all staff, students, and administrators.  Professional development is provided every Monday and grade level meetings every Wednesday.  Additional PD  opoportunities are attended if they are practically aligned to our needs in CCLS. These may be attended by any staff, whether  teacher, paraprofessional, secretarial, support staff, related service providers, guidance counselors, or administrative staff.  These include training in Hochman writing and Really Great Reading.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Training to meet requirements and facilitation of student transition from middle to high school is provided during conference  days, faculty conferences, and grade team meetings. Students have support available from the guidance counselor,  administrative staff, and social workers.  Professional development activities and agendas are developed and shared through Google Drive. Activities include include  training in Hochman writing and Really Great Reading. Records are maintained through sign in sheets and agendas.rofessional  development activities and agendas are developed and shared through Google Drive.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Monthly workshops are offered to parents in addition to the workshops that are offered by for example, the Haitian Family  Resource Center.  Parents are invited to honor roll celebrations and to the year end celebration of learning that has taken  place in community service experiences at the 53 different medical facilities we are partners with. Parents are sent links to  surveys asking how our school community could support them. Translation services, where not able to be provided by staff,  are obtained through NYC DOE translation services.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  HSMP hosts a cultural event sponsored by the Anime and HOSA clubs as well as montly parental workshops where parents are  invited to come and learn about what it happening in the school. The parent coordinator maintains parental outreach, alerting  parents as to when and where events will be held.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Pauline O'brien, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
