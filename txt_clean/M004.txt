This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our mission is to meet the academic, social, and emotional needs of all our students, including our English Language  Learners and Students with Special Needs, through our various educational programs and resources. We seek to  foster greater harmony within the school community by challenging all of our students, parents and staff to achieve  their fullest potential, instilling in them a love for learning. We envision developing lifelong learners and leaders who  will demonstrate respect for themselves, as well as others. Our goal is to create an enriching environment that meets  and exceeds the Standards, by providing students and the school community in general, with extensive educational   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      opportunities that promote academic achievement along with racial, ethnic, and cultural sensitivity; tolerance; and  cooperation.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   As per the 2017-2018 Quality Review, our area of celebration is the communication of high expectations to students,  staff and parents. School leaders consistently communicate high expectations to the entire staff. Our most recent  Principal’s Performance Observation (PPO) also indicates that we have a "well-coordinated student services that align  to student needs to support student growth." We have a strong partnership with Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, and  through their services we are able to afford our students with additional social and emotional support. Staff also  receive professional learning cycles with strategies to help them support the social and emotional needs of the  individual students in their class. We adopted the Positive Behavior Interventions and Support (PBIS) system in an  effort to promote a culture of mutual respect, as well as a platform of exuding positive characteristics. The PBIS  committee developed the PRIDE Matrix (Positive, Respect, Integrity, Determination, and Excellence) as a means by  which to improve academic and personal behavior.    Feedback from our 2017-2018 Quality Review states that our school leaders and staff communicate expectations on a  consistent basis that are connected to a path to college and career readiness. We also provide stakeholders with  professional learning and have a system of accountability for those high expectations. Ongoing feedback is provided  to help families understand student progress toward those expectations. We seek to foster greater harmony within  the school community by challenging all of our students, parents and staff to achieve their fullest potential; instilling  in them a love for learning.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   P.S. 004 Duke Ellington is an elementary school with 507 students from pre-kindergarten through grade 5. Currently  our school population is comprised of 89% Hispanic, 1.15 American Indian or Alaskan Native, 1% Asian and 8%  African-American. Boys presently account for 54% of the students enrolled and girls account for 46%. In 2017-2018,  the school population comprised of 91% Hispanic, 1.15% American Indian or Alaskan Native, 1% Asian, and 6.87%  African-American. Boys account for 54.83% of the students enrolled and girls account for 45.17%. The average  attendance rate for the school year 2017-2018 was 92.2% as of June 16, 2018. Even though our students showed  progress on the state standardized tests, one of our main challenges last year was the modest performance levels of  our ELL/ENL children and Students With Disabilities. One of our school initiatives is to support our ELL/ENL and Special  Education scholars in achieving higher levels of English proficiency by expanding the learning opportunities offered to  them both in the after school and Saturday Academy programs, tailored specifically to their academic, social and  emotional needs.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our 2017-2018 Quality Review indicated Component 1.2 as developing. During our PPO during the 2017-2018 school  year, QR Components 2.2: Align assessments to curricula, use on-going assessment and grading practices, and analyze  information on student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team and classroom levels and 4.2:  Engage in structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared leadership  and focuses on improved student learning - were identified as Highly-Effective or Effective. Quality Review indicator  1.2: Develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best that is informed by the  instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligned to the curricula, engaging, and meets the needs of  all learners so that all students produce meaningful work products - was still identified as Developing. Although we  have made improvements in the areas of 2.2 and 4.2, there remains room for improvement in aligning our   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      assessments more effectively to our curricula as well as creating more structured professional collaborative efforts to  develop teachers on various levels.   This takes us to our main focus for the school year 2018-2019 in more effectively developing teacher pedagogy  informed by Danielson Framework for Teaching. In order to Develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs  about how students learn best that is informed by the instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching,  aligned to the curricula, engaging, and meets the needs of all learners so that all students produce meaningful work  products, our school will be adopting the ideals from the Handbook for Professional Learning as published by the NYC  DOE. We will align our professional development sessions to directly reflect our teachers’ needs from the ADVANCE  summary and detail reports. Our intention is to provide more meaningful professional learning opportunities through  the creation of genuine professional learning communities and cycles.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 06M004   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   557   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.      1.  Area of Strength:   With an understanding that there was a change in the 2018 NYS English Language Arts (ELA) exam, a two-year  comparative review shows a 3 point increase in proficiency.

Last year's program served approximately 200 of our students that  were identified as "pushables" or "slipables' as compared to 60 students in prior years. Participating students were  identified by reviewing performance data from multiple data points (e.g., NYS exams, BOY assessments, F&P  assessments, etc.). We also progress monitored student growth during program participation; administering practice  exams and using data to adjust and/or drive instruction. In addition to continuing the after-school and Saturday  academic enrichment programs, this year we built AIS into our daily schedule by creating AIS clusters in math, reading  and writing.       Our 2017-2018 NYS Office of Bilingual Education and World Languages (OBEWL) Review noted pedagogy and over  referral of English Language Leaners (ELLs) as areas of concern. It was recommended that we (1) provide teachers  support on differentiation and grouping of students; (2) conduct professional learning on the changes to the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      NYSESLAT exam; (3) use NYSESLAT sampler to practice with students, have teachers become accustomed to the types  of questions asked, practice SPEAKING component; and (4) use after-school to teach sight words and vocabulary.       Recommendations were implemented in the 2017-2018 school year, and we continue to support teachers with  differentiation within the professional learning cycles developed for the 2018-2019 school year. In addition, 2017- 2018 saw additional changes, such as (1) support of a bilingual special education specialists from the Regional Special  Education Technical Assistance Support Center (RSE-TASC); (2) modification of the language acquisition plan (LAP) for  each of our transitional bilingual classes, which better aligned with student needs; and (3) providing professional  learning to support teachers in having a better understanding of language acquisition v. language disability, which  assisted in reducing the overall referrals by 38%. In 2018-2019 we expand our Dual Language program from  Kindergarten only to Kindergarten through grade two.

As a result, administration culled and reviewed next steps provided to teachers as an  outgrowth of ADVANCE observations conducted in the 2017-2018 school year. Based on this data, a professional  learning plan to provide teachers with meaningful and impactful professional learning was developed. This  professional learning cycle will be the vehicle by which to improve instructional practices, as well as increase  opportunities for teachers to engage in meaningful collaboration in the planning and preparation of lessons that meet  student needs.      In order to better support engaging, rigorous, and coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners  and aligned to Common Core learning standards, our school focus will be Charlotte Danielson's Domain 1 - Planning  & Preparation to align our instructional practices to meet the needs of our students. This will enable our instructional  staff to deliver lessons that are aligned to the Common Core Standards, as well as provide opportunities for students  to be engaged in rigorous instruction that address the needs of various learners. The intent is to elevate our  instructional practices; thereby creating an environment filled with opportunities for students to engage in high level  intellectual activities and development of critical thinking skills.

We also implemented an incentive- based system to encourage student attendance during periods where we have historically seen a decline. This  collective approach has assisted us in maintaining an average attendance rate of 90+%.   According to our 2017-2018 Quality Review (QR), as well as our 2017-2018 Principal Practice Observation (PPO), QR  Indicator 3.4 - Establish a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students and families,  and provide supports to achieve those expectations was an area of celebration for our school community. Evidence  to support the PROFICIENT rating on QR Indicator 3.4, and its impact on establishing a culture for learning that  communicates high expectations to staff include, "The principal publishes a weekly newsletter to communicate high  expectations to staff. In a December newsletter, the principal highlighted the expectation that teachers must use  multiple strategies to check for understanding. This was supported by professional development on December eleven  entitled How to Engage Students. The professional development was designed to support assessment as defined in  the Danielson Framework for Teaching. The newsletter also stated that teachers should be using data to drive  instruction. This expectation was supported by a running records analysis conducted by the assistant principals and  the coaches. Teachers have stated that expectations are communicated and supported by training and professional  development thus allowing them to improve their pedagogy. Communicated expectations and support are followed  up by frequent cycles of classroom observations to determine implementation, as well as non-evaluative and  evaluative visits from the principal and coaches."   Although there is an overall positive school culture, we want to ensure we continue to recognize and celebrate  students’ academic and behavioral excellence; thereby further promoting positive attitudes as well as academic  achievement. We continue efforts in our Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) school-wide system to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          21      further develop a positive culture for school stakeholders. A review of the Online Occurrence Reporting System  (OORs) data shows a 55% decline in student incidents reported within the 2017-2018 school year. We contribute this  decline to our school community celebrating positive behavior via our PBIS system on a daily, weekly and monthly  basis using Knight Notes, incentives, assemblies, certificates, etc. This decline in behavioral concerns supports  additional time on task for student engagement in classroom instruction.

Area of Growth:   Although we received a PROFICIENT rating on our 2017-2018 Quality Review for Indicator 1.4 - How safe and inclusive  is the school while supporting social-emotional growth? and 3.4 - How clearly are high expectations communicated  to students and staff?, we saw a 1.47% decline in the element scores for the Supportive Environment component on  the 20`17-201`8 New York City School Survey. As a result, there is a need to acknowledge and celebrate students’  academic and behavioral excellence to promote positive attitudes, as well as academic achievement. We will continue  our efforts in Year 2 of our PBIS program to further develop a positive school culture for our staff, students and  parents alike.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.  1.  Area of Strength:   With an understanding that there was a change in the 2018 NYS Math exam, a two-year comparative review shows a  3.7 point increase in proficiency.       Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Level 4  Proficient   2017   2018   Difference   48.9%  29.8%  15.7%  5.6%  21.3%   44.3%  28.6%  17.9%  7.1%  25.0%   -4.6%  -1.2%  +2.2%  +1.5%  +3.7%                        Similar to our gains in ELA, we attribute this change, in part, to our Academic Intervention Services (AIS) after-school  programming; which was started earlier in the academic school year (e.g., September 2017), as well as increased the  number of days and hours of services (e.g., 5 days/week, 2.5 hours/day). Last year's program served approximately  200 of our students that were identified as "pushables" or "slipables' as compared to 60 students in prior years.  Student selection to participate in the after-school and Saturday academies was based on a review of performance  data from multiple data points (e.g., NYS exams, BOY assessments, practice exams, iReady instructional reports, etc.).  Progress monitoring was also embedded in programming to ensure the use of data to drive instruction. After-school  and Saturday Academy organizational structures will continue in the 2018-2019 school year. In addition, this year we  built AIS directly into our daily schedule by creating AIS clusters in math, reading and writing.       We continue our efforts to create an environment of collaboration to further improve pedagogy. Quality Review  Indicator 4.2 - Engage in structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes  shared leadership and focuses on improved student learning was an area of celebration on our 2017-2018 PPO and  rated proficient in our 2017-2018 QR. Evidence to support the PROFICIENT rating on QR Indicator 4.2, and its impact  on engaging in structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared  leadership and focuses on improved student learning was noted as:    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          26                 Teachers use beginning-of-the-year assessments across grades to determine progress and also assure that   student performance is aligned with the school goals which include decreasing Level one performance in  math. For example, after analyzing these assessments, it was evident that students in the testing grades were  struggling with fractions. As a result, pacing calendars were adjusted to include more lessons on fractions  earlier in the year to provide more time for exposure and further assessments. Teachers also discovered that  students across grades were struggling with short response questions. This was based on looking at prior  State exams, beginning-of-the-year and middle-of-the-year assessments. As a result, literacy has been  implemented across all contents to provide students with more exposure to writing. This was evident in  lesson and unit plans reviewed. Consultants were also hired to provide additional supports to the teachers.     Rubrics are used to provide feedback to students to ensure that they are aware of their learning steps and  progress. A sample writing rubric from a grade-one class was reviewed. It covered areas including, did the  picture tell a story, topic generation, letter attempts, and letter sounds. The student work was rated from a  blank face which represented below expectations, to two eyes, a smiley face and a face with a huge smile  which represented mastery. The student received a two-eyed face in the area of, the picture tells a story and  able to generate a topic. Feedback to the student included, “Your picture really expresses how you feel. You  are working very hard to form your letters correctly. Next time make sure you put spaces between your words  so the reader can read it.” An additional example was evident on a grade-three math rubric. The student was  being rated from one to three. The student received a three for “Evidence of understanding task is shown,  numerator and denominator are accurate, and work is correct.” Feedback to the student included, “Evidence  of the task is correct. Be careful when shading, be sure you are accurate with the number to be shaded.”  Rubrics used to provide actionable feedback were evident in most classes visited.   2.  Area of Growth:   Our 2017-2018 Quality Review noted Component 1.2 - Develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs  about how students learn best that is informed by the instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching,  aligned to the curricula, engaging, and meets the needs of all learners so that all students produce meaningful work  products as an area of focus. As a result, administration culled and reviewed next steps provided to teachers as an  outgrowth of ADVANCE observations conducted in the 2017-2018 school year. Based on this data, a professional  learning plan to provide teachers with meaningful and impactful professional learning was developed. This  professional learning cycle will be the vehicle by which to improve instructional practices, as well as increase  opportunities for teachers to engage in meaningful collaboration in the planning and preparation of lessons that meet  student needs.      In order to better support engaging, rigorous, and coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners  and aligned to Common Core learning standards, our school focus will be Charlotte Danielson's Domain 1 - Planning  & Preparation to align our instructional practices to meet the needs of our students. This will enable our instructional  staff to deliver lessons that are aligned to the Common Core Standards, as well as provide opportunities for students  to be engaged in rigorous instruction that address the needs of various learners. The intent is to elevate our  instructional practices; thereby creating an environment filled with opportunities for students to engage in high level  intellectual activities and development of critical thinking skills.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          27     Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.  1.  Area of Strength   Our 2018-2019 Principal Practice Observation (PPO) rated QR Component 4.1 - Observe teachers using the Danielson  Framework for Teaching along with the analysis of learning outcomes to elevate school-wide instructional practices  and implement strategies that promote professional growth and reflection as HIGHLY EFFECTIVE/EFFECTIVE, while  our 2017-2018 QR provided a rating of PROFICIENT. PPO feedback cited, that support and evaluation of teachers "is  done through the use of the Danielson Framework and analysis of students’ work. Completion of required  observation of staff are organized via a yearlong observation calendar and there is evidence that the observation  process elevate school-wide instructional practices, promotes professional growth and reflection and improves  academic achievement. Structures to support distributive leadership are in place. Instructional coach and the peer  collaborative teachers support the needs of the staff. Grade leaders also provide support in guiding their grade level  collaborative planning sessions." While QR feedback cited that the principal "uses Advance observation reports to  conduct formal observations of teachers and provide support and articulate instructional expectations. An example  was evident in an observation report of a teacher from last October. The teacher was rated developing under the area  of using assessment in instruction. The principal stated, 'Students appear to be only partially aware of the assessment  criteria; the teacher monitors student learning for the class as a whole.' The principal stated that instructional  expectations include all teachers must incorporate checks for understanding as a form of assessment. To support this  expectation, feedback included, 'Consider using a checklist to track student responses. There must be a strong  connection between teacher monitoring of students’ learning progress.' This level of feedback was evident in all  observations reviewed."   During the 2017-2018 school year, we implemented a system in which the administrative team modeled structures,  protocols and/or practices (e.g., data analysis, looking at student work, item analysis, etc.) to grade team leaders  during weekly grade team leader meetings. This practice, which builds capacity and allows grade team leaders to  turnkey information at their respective grade team meetings, will be continued within the 2018-2019 school year. In  addition, during the 2018-2019 school year, the professional learning cycles were developed based on a review of  ADVANCE data from 2017-2018 observations, established goals, as well feedback from the initial planning  conferences (IPC) . As a result we facilitate two 4-week cycles of professional learning simultaneously at the same  time; assigning teachers to a cycle based on their specific needs.      2.  Area of Growth   During the 2017-2018 school year, we received a rating of INEFFECTIVE on our Principal Practice Observation (PPO)  and a DEVELOPING rating on our Quality Review in Component 1.2 - Pedagogy. Feedback from the PPO indicated a  need to "monitor and evaluate pedagogical practices to ensure expected instructional practices such as explicit  teaching, workshop model, instructional grouping, instructional planning model, checking for understanding, and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32      progress monitoring are consistently visible and reflected during daily lessons." To address this need, we have  modified the way in which we deliver professional learning, as well as partnered with specialists to provide more  targeted professional learning opportunities. In addition, we determined that Charlotte Danielson's Domain 1 -  Planning & Preparation should be a focus for developing pedagogy with our teachers. This will enable instructional  staff to deliver lessons that are aligned to the Common Core Standards, as well as provide opportunities for students  to be engaged in rigorous instruction that address the needs of various learners.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.  1.  Area of Strength:   Strong parent involvement has been evident throughout the years at our school and is continuing to show upward  movement. We have created events and activities that involve our parents and community on various levels. With the  support of our parent coordinator, we have seen more participation and involvement of our parents and the  community. We also create opportunities for rewarding our students by involving our parents on incentive trips and  raffle drawings to further promote positive inclusion of our parents within our school community.   The 2017-2018 New York City School Survey indicates that 89% of our families say they are likely to attend general  school meetings or school events, while 94% said they are like to attend regularly scheduled parent-teacher  conferences. Effectively partnering with families to support student success (Indicator 3.4) was an area of celebration  in our 2017-2018 Quality Review. For example, to support parent engagement we provide opportunities for parents  to attend workshops on curriculum, college and career readiness, nutrition, etc. The school also hosts events such as  Coffee with the Principal and Town Hall meetings as additional opportunities to provide information and address  parent concerns.    2.  Area of Growth:   Although we have seen parent involvement increase in our school, there still is a need for parents to not only be  informed of the academic aspects of our institution, but to ingratiate themselves in order to foster a strong school  community based on trust. We intend to create more interactions through information sessions on how to access  grades, monitor their child’s progress and connect with the classroom teachers on a regular basis to further  encourage academic excellence of our students. The focus is to improve attendance at parent teacher conferences,  improve the school community and create a positive school culture. Communication with parents will be in their  native language and interpreters will be provided during family workshops and parent teacher conferences to ensure  that all of our families feel welcome at our school.   Baseline Data - 200 of 592 parents (34% ) attended our first Family Night/Parent Teacher Conference for the 2018- 2019 school year in comparison to 254 out of 609 parents (42%) attending our September Family Night/Parent  Teacher-Conference.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.   1.  We are constantly in search of highly qualified teachers through job fairs and recruitment services, such as   International Teachers and Teaching Fellow Programs. We have established partnerships with several  universities and colleges for their students to complete their fieldwork, such as Fordham University and City  College. In this way, we can identify possible candidates to become part of our staff.   2.  When we hire partially qualified teachers in license areas of need, we require them to register in a college   program to finish the requirements for their respective licenses. Once they receive their final course grades,  we reimburse their tuition as an incentive for them to complete the requirements to become highly qualified  teachers. We have developed a rigorous scrutiny process to fill up vacancies, which includes an extensive  interview with several members of the administrative staff and a demonstrative lesson.   3.  All our new teachers have mentors from their respective programs, as well as an internal mentors or buddy  teachers, who help them with the establishment of daily routines and the planning of rigorous and engaging  lessons.   4.  We carefully look at the teachers' program preference sheets, seniority list, final ratings, and formal and   informal observations to make decisions about the teacher's assignments and retention status.   5.  Using this analysis we also determine specific teachers' needs for additional professional development and   training that assist them to become highly effective teachers. This states the background for our Annual  Professional Development Plan, which is adjusted through the year based on the teacher's observations,  learning walks, and discussions during the weekly grade data/planning sessions. An instructional coach and  additional assistant principal will be hired to facilitate this process.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).      1.  The school has developed a professional learning plan based on the needs determined by the teachers’   observations and Charlotte Danielson’s Framework for Teaching. This plan will be differentiated according to  the specific teachers’ needs. We expect that the multiple opportunities for specific and differentiated staff  development will affect in a positive way the effectiveness of our teachers, resulting in them becoming highly  qualified educators with an extensive repertoire of strategies to develop each student’s potential.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      2.  This plan includes weekly planning sessions to develop and discuss curriculum activities aligned to the   Common Core Learning Standards, and weekly training sessions about teaching strategies focusing on the  different components of Danielson’s Framework for Teaching. Teachers will be also sent outside of the school  to receive additional training and professional development according to their needs, as a way to differentiate  the professional development based on the different levels of proficiency.   3.  Using an analysis of the data gathered through the teachers’ observations, students’ progress reports, and  parents and teachers’ surveys, we have developed a schedule of professional development activities that  include a diversity of topics such as:   ● Questioning techniques w/ in-class demos and videos   ● Guided Reading   ● ESL Strategies and Techniques   ● Technology uses including programs available which align with the curriculum.   ● Reading Reform practices & techniques and include in-class observations   ● How to effectively administer and use Running Records   ● How to more effectively implement and structure the “mini-lesson” to differentiated tasks initiation.   ● How to “Unpack” Journeys, including all of the supportive texts within the package.   ● Depth of Knowledge [DOK] wheel and incorporating it into lessons   ● CCLS Aligned Portfolio Pieces   4.  We will group teachers into different cohorts depending of their specific needs. These different cohorts will   participate in learning walks, inter-classroom visitations, study groups, and demonstrative lesson pertinent to  their areas of continued growth. There will be also one-to-one sessions for teachers, especially the one under  a teacher improvement plan (TIP).   5.  The school principal and other administrators will also attend to workshops and staff development sessions  according to their specific needs and areas of supervision such as Math Department, Bilingual Department,  Special Education, Testing, etc. In addition to the monthly staff development sessions and study groups  offered by District 6, they will also attend to outside training sessions according to the mentioned supervision  areas.

TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      N/A                Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).   1.  Our Pre-K teacher uses a Common Core aligned curriculum and similar teaching strategies and methodologies,   as the rest of our classroom teachers to impart instruction. She participates in all the staff development  activities and training sessions, as well. In this way, we guarantee the continuity of programs, teaching  approaches, and students’ expectations. The curricular program used for our pre-kindergarten teacher is Core  Knowledge. As stated in their website, Core Knowledge Language Arts Preschool (CKLA Preschool) is a  comprehensive English Language Arts curriculum designed to prepare young children for later reading success  by building foundational language and literacy skills.   2.  CKLA Preschool materials and instruction provide explicit, systematic support for developing young children’s  language, literacy, and content knowledge within the context of developmentally-appropriate early childhood  settings. CKLA Preschool is fully aligned with the New York State Foundation for the Common Core Standards  for Communication and Literacy. This program provides excellent preparation for young children who will be  entering a Kindergarten classroom implementing the Core Knowledge Language Arts Kindergarten curriculum.  The literacy skills, vocabulary, and content knowledge developed in CKLA Preschool are explicitly designed to  provide a foundation for the skills and content taught in CKLA Kindergarten classrooms.* Additionally, CKLA  Preschool can be used as a stand-alone preschool language arts curriculum that comprises part of a  comprehensive preschool curriculum— regardless of subsequent content and method of instruction.   3.  Each day of CKLA Preschool instruction is designed to be engaging and appropriate for students ages four and  five years who are enrolled in early childhood programs. Complete plans are provided for 45 minutes of daily  instructional time that is designed to be implemented within activity contexts that already exist in most early  childhood settings. In addition to explicit instruction in early language and literacy skills, CKLA Preschool  develops students’ knowledge of content areas— including social studies and science—by consistently  exposing students to rich, developmentally appropriate texts and activities over the course of a school year.  CKLA Preschool is organized into seven domain-based units of instruction addressing both fiction and  nonfiction content. Each domain-based unit focuses on an area of content knowledge that is foundational to  children’s later learning. By studying each of these domains over a period of approximately twenty  instructional days, students are given many opportunities to develop the vocabulary and content knowledge  that will later determine their academic success, particularly reading success.   As we do with the all the students in our school, the pre-kindergarten teacher will perform formative and summative  assessments to determine the progress of the children and their needs for early intervention. Our school based  supporting team discuss the needs of these kids and the appropriate actions to take including at-risk intervention  services and/or informal and formal learning evaluations.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      At P.S. 4 we strive to ensure that all members of the school community are heard and take part in the decision  process as follows:   1.  We begin the year by forming a Measure of Student Learning Committee (MOSL) integrated by administrators  and teacher representatives, which decides the New York City mandated assessments required by law, as well  as any other additional methods of students’ evaluation for the year.   2.  We also created lead teacher positions by grade, who participate in the decision making process during their   meetings with the administration and their respective constituencies.   3.  There is also a consultation committee, comprised of teachers, paraprofessionals, and other staff members,   who meet in a monthly basis with the administration to express their concerns and offer ideas in reference to  assessments, progress monitoring and several other issues.   4.  The School Leadership Team (SLT), which is comprised of parents, teachers, and administrators, meets on a   monthly basis. They ensure that programs, initiatives, and school policies, including assessment, are  developed following an inclusive model; where all the members of the school community are represented  and actively participate in the decision-making process.   5.  School will develop a series of Town Hall meetings with the principal for parents and teachers to guarantee   that everyone is heard.   6.  The MOSL committee, with the support of administration, collectively determine the NYC assessment tools to   measure students' progress and determine the teacher's final ratings, teacher evaluate assessment data in  their weekly common grade data/planning sessions.   7.  At that time, decisions about other appropriate assessment instruments, such as A-Z Reading, IXL, Accelerated   Reading and Math, iReady, etc. are made. They will present their suggestions to the administration and SLT  members, in order to make the final decisions and acquire e respective and appropriate assessments tools.  The teacher will continue receiving professional development by an external consultant about the  establishment of more effective ways and protocols to analyze data and make adjustment to their teaching  styles and curriculum to improve the students' performance. This consultant will also assist in the  desegregation and posterior analysis of our benchmark tests; which will be offered in a quarterly basis.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51        Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   PS 4 Duke Ellington School    Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) 2018-2019    1.  Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student  achievement. The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure  effective involvement of parents and community in our school. Therefore, our school, in compliance with the  Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and  implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between our school and the families. Our school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively  involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are  encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent and Teachers Association, and Title  I Parent Committee, as trained volunteers and welcomed members of our school community.   2.  Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all   parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities.  Our school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent  involvement policy with Title I parents, to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the  evaluation through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively  meet the needs of parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by  the school.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent-Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on  the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input.   Our school will support parents and families of Title I students by:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53           providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level   in literacy, math, science, social studies and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between our parents  and other members of our school community.

This process will improve their reading fluency through oral  reinforcement and will most definitely increase their comprehension of the course material.  The  certified ENL/Bilingual P.S. 4 teachers working in concert with the parents will focus on  improving academic English by referring to the previous year’s NYSESLAT data (reading,  writing, listening and speaking modalities) and frame the language development with an original  mythological play of their own.   The Mythological play will be based on their experience of the myths studied with specific  focus on virtues being shared and strong components of writing a myth/fiction piece. From their  writing the students will be expected to work in cohorts to dramatize their writing in the form of  a short theatrical performance to be shared at the concluding Saturday academy in front of their  parents and community.  This will give their written work a powerful voice with supplemental enriching activities like the  culminating “ELL Theater Fest” that will not only warrant academic achievement in core  academic areas but will have a resounding positive effect on the personal lives of our culturally  diverse ELL scholars and their families. The Saturday academy will have scheduled dates where  the Parent coordinator will invite the scholar’s parent’s to work with their respective children and  help foster a stronger connection to the valuable meaning of language and culture.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  PS 4 The Duke Ellington School uses a battery of tests to measure and monitor the progress of all the students, including  ELLs, as follows:     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The school provides teachers with a pacing calendar for all the curricular materials that include specific dates to perform all  the formative and summative assessments mentioned before. They meet in a weekly basis as a grade during a common  planning session of two periods, to analyze all this data and plan their lessons accordingly.    Each teacher is encouraged to have a data binder with the results and analysis of these assessments; which is used to facilitate  the establishment of students' individual goals and the monitor of them through individual one to one conferences.  All these   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      grades and information are entered in "Skedula"; an online data-based program that offers ongoing progress reports to  parents and students.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?     As described before PS 4 uses the following formative and summative assessments to dermine baseline, prgress and areas of  need:       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data is gathered and analyzed during the common grade planning sessions, teachers use the information  to establish flexible learning groups that help them to differentiate the instruction during the lesson.    In addition, the school has determined a scheduled an "intervention-center time"  period for ELA and Math, where students  are homogeneously grouped according o their needs. During these periods (one for Language Arts and one for Math)  children  receive remedial instruction in their own classrooms through learning activities according to their specific needs.  The  Language Arts centers include the five strands of language: phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary development, fluency  and reading comprehension. Correspondingly, the math centers include the strands of number sense and numeration,  measurement, probability and statistics, geometry and algebra.    Each one of the center activities are culminated with an accountable sheet that helps teachers to determine the students'  progress and the needs for additional intervention.         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]     Tier I- As mentioned before, our school has implemented the curricula from Senderos/ and Journeys, Go Math, Amplify  Science and Passport to Social Studies with additional supporting and enhancing performance based tasks from Engage New  York . All these programs are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and offer a rigorous and robust curriculum that  satisfies the demands of high standards established by the state. The data collected through the baseline, formative and  summative assessment tools offered by these programs is used to universally screen students and group them accordingly to  receive differentiated instruction during the lessons. The baseline test is offered at the beginning of the school year; followed  by unit tests and performance based assessment tasks (PBA). The offering of a common core aligned curriculum with  differentiated activities in a daily and consistently basis through  the scheduling of a school wide pacing calendar can be  considered our first tier of intervention for all our students including our ELLs, as per our Response to Intervention plan.       Within  this Tier I, all students receive high-quality, scientifically based instruction provided by qualified personnel to ensure  that their difficulties are not due to inadequate instruction. All students are screened on a periodic basis to establish an  academic and behavioral baseline and to identify struggling learners who need additional support. Students identified as being  “at risk”  receive supplemental instruction during the school day in the regular classroom through the sue of  differentiated activities and center time tasks. All these programs contain a strong component for ELLs that offers scaffolding  activities for English language learners that help teachers to differentiate the instruction, as a medium to offer intervention, as  part of our school wide  Response to Intervention plan. It is our goal to continue offering professional development  opportunities to teachers that make them experts on the use  of the different intervention components to prepare our  students to fulfill the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards.     Tier II- As mentioned before, along with the differentiation of the instruction during the lesson, as per the data collected, the  students' schedules accommodate one daily period of additional intervention in math and one in ELA called "center time" that  can be considered our  Tier II of intervention. These centers offer a more strategic and intense intervention instruction   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      according to the specific students' needs; as reflected in the different stands assessed during our monthly and  quarterly exams.  Our Tier II intervention strategy is designed to offer struggling students, including ELL children a series of  center activities in Reading and Math to address their particular needs. There are two periods of center time in the pre- designed teachers’ schedules to perform these center activities, as per our school policies.  These center activities are  designed taking into consideration the various language proficiency levels of our students, as analyzed by the  EDAT NYSESLAT test report.     Tier III- The Tier III intervention is structured as a series of pull out programs to deal in a more individual basis with struggling  students. We measure the progress of these intervention programs through a series of periodic assessment as described  before. We use this data to make educational decisions about our ELL's instruction and services; as well as whether or not  consider a referral for special education services.      Our intervention team members take into account language development and background. We constantly monitor the  student’s data to place those who are at risk for academic difficulties to receive intervention from the beginning of the year in  September. All ELL students are invited to an after school and an action plan is determined according to their literacy skills.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].

At the beginning of the year a baseline test is offered in all the subjects to determine students' levels, needs of intervention  and initial grouping in the classroom to receive differentiated instructions, as prescribed by the curriculum programs.  In  addition, the results of the state tests ELA, Math and NYSESLAT tests are analyzed by our data specialist and presented to the  teachers  during the initial  common grade weekly  planning meetings and professional development sessions.  It is  during these meetings that the focus standards for ELA and Math are established school wide.     After that, teachers hold weekly common planning sessions per grade, where  formative and summative assessment data is  analyzed and instructional decision are made; to adjusts the curricular pacing calendars and enhance lessons. The purpose is  to attack students' deficiencies and establish intervention goals, as per the data analyzed.      State standardized tests simulations and  quarterly monitoring progress assessments are offered school wide, as described  before. The results of these test are also analyzed by our data specialist and a report is presented to teachers during these   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         planning sessions, so they can make more strategic and intense further adjustments to the curriculum and  their  teaching strategies.             Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.        PS 4 will have the following 'Freestanding" ENL classes:       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     P.S 4 offers a Late Exit Transitional Bilingual Program to students whose parents selected bilingual programs,  where  children develop skills in their home language as they learn English as follows:               c.  DL program.  If applicable.        PS 4 will start a pilot Two-Way  Dual Language Program (DL program)  in two kindergarten classes this school year  2017-2018. In this way we will start facing off our actual transitional bilingual program in kindergarten by replacing it  with a DL program. We will be incrementing  the DL model one grade at a time each subsequent school year. It will  take five years to complete the complete transformation of our actual TBE model into a DL model.    Our Two-Way Dual Language Program integrates Spanish proficient students (ELL's)  who are learning English  with  English proficient students who are learning Spanish. They will receive all the instruction in English and Spanish  in the same classroom to develop academic progress aligned to grade appropriate curriculum and linguistic  proficiency in both languages as follows:        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?     The school looks at the result of the NYSESLAT-NYSITELL  scores and the parent program selection forms to group the students  into the different programs, as explained before: Freestanding, TBE and DL.    Program schedules are prepared and given  to teachers reflecting  the number of minutes of Home Language and ENL  instruction to be taught. These minutes and the needed support of ENL certified teachers are determined  according to the  students' levels as per the mandates of  Part 154 guidelines:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69             3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Our school ensures curricula is aligned to the Common Core and makes purposeful decisions aimed at building instructional  coherence across the school to promote college and career readiness for all students.      Students in the Transitional Bilingual  (TBE) Model receive Instruction as follows:   Students in the Freestanding ENL Classes receive instruction as follows:  Students in the Two-Way Dual Language Program receive instruction as follows:          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?     "Senderos" program offers a complete battery of baseline, progress monitoring and summative assessments in Spanish to  determine the students' language proficiency in their home language. These assessment will be performed in a consistent  basis throughout the year. We also use the assessments from "Estrellita" which offer baseline , as well as progress monitoring  tests. These assessments are just for the students that are at the initial stages of native language acquisition:  decoding/syllabication level. The students that can read in their native language are assessed through "Senderos" and teacher  made tests in every content area in accordance with the LAP. We use Accelerated Reader in English and native language as our  independent reader indicator.      In Mathematics, we are using Go Math and the curriculum and assessment is all in their native language. The New York City  Performance Mathematics assessment is also given in their native language as well as the Science and Mathematics State tests  along with ELE ( El Examen de Lectura en Espanol).       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    ELL and SWD use the same rigorous curriculum as the other classes. Teachers are mandated to differentiate instruction to  address each child's particular needs and levels. Literacy and Math Centers have been created to support instruction in ELA  following the Florida Center for Reading Research methodology. A specific period of a day is being scheduled in each teacher's  program to guarantee the implementation of this policy.       a)     SIFE Students- Besides the regular programs described before, SIFE students receive an extra period of ELA/Math  instruction in small group through a “pull-out” program. They are also participating of a Saturday Academy program receiving  instruction in ELA and Math.     b)     Newcomer ELL’s (less than 3 years) - Besides the regular programs described before, new immigrant students with less  than three years in the system, participate in a Saturday Academy program receiving instruction in ELA and Math. They are  also receiving native language instruction and ESL after school twice a week after school.     c)     ELL’s receiving services 4 to 6 years- Besides the regular programs described before, ELLs with 5 to 6 years also participate  of a Saturday Academy program receiving instruction in ELA and Math.     d)     Long term ELL’s (more than 6 years) - We have two long term ELL's this year. Besides the regular programs described   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      before,  this students receive an additional period of intervention from a reading specialist every day. They also participate in a  3 hour Saturday Academy program receiving instruction in ELA and Math from November till March 2014.     e)     ELL’s with Special Needs-Besides the regular programs described before, ELL’s with Special Needs receive small group  instruction in ELA and Math through a Saturday Academy program.     All ELLs and former ELLs for up to two years after testing out are eligible for ELL testing accommodations, in addition to any  accommodations on their IEPs or 504 Plans. We make every effort to determine which accommodations are most suitable and  beneficial  for each ELL at the beginning of the school year. ELLs are entitled to using those accommodations for most  assessments, including those that are teacher-made and State-mandated with the exception of the NYSESLAT.     Testing accommodations for ELL students on the NYS ELA and content-area assessments include the following:   Some ELLs are eligible for a one-time exemption from the New York State English Language Arts Exam in grades 3 to 8.     Time extension (all exams): Schools may extend the test time for ELL students on NYS ELA and content-area assessments.     • Separate location (all exams)     • Third reading of listening selection (English Language Arts exams only): Proctors may read the listening passage three times  to ELLs on grades 3-8 English Language Arts assessments and on the Regents Comprehensive Examination in English.     Bilingual dictionaries and/or glossaries: ELLs may use bilingual glossaries when taking State examinations in all subjects except  languages other than English exams (LOTE). The bilingual dictionaries and glossaries may provide only direct one-to-one  translations of words.     • Simultaneous use of English and alternative language editions are not allowed for English Language Arts examinations. For  state examinations for which SED provides written translations, ELLs may use both English and an alternative language edition  of the test simultaneously.     • Oral translations for low incidence languages are not allowed for English Language Arts examinations. We may provide ELL  students with an oral translation of a state examination when there is no translated edition provided by SED. All translations  must be oral, direct translations of the English editions. Written translations are not allowed. No clarifications or explanations  may be provided. Translators should receive copies of the English edition of the tests one hour prior to administration.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL and SWD students use the same materials as the rest of the classes. Teachers are mandated to differentiate instruction to  address each child's particular needs and levels.    Differntaites Literacy and Math centers have been created to support instruction in ELA following the Florida Center for  Reading Research methodology. A specific period of a day is being scheduled in each teacher's program to guarantee the  implementation of this policy.     Ready Gen, Go Math, Harcourt Science, passport to Social Studies and "Senderos" (Journeys)  are implemented in all the  classes as explained before.  All these curricular programs contain specific lessons, tasks and components that help teachers to  differentiate the instruction according to the students' levels and needs.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL and SWD students in a least restrictive environment are placed in Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) classes with two teachers to  ensure that instruction is differentiated according to their levels and specific needs. One of the ICT teachers is fully certified in  Special Education and works diligently and collaboratively with the other teacher to meet the student's IEP goals.     The school makes sure that the special education students have as many opportunities with their non-disabled peers during  the school day. Some of the periods are in the morning for breakfast, during lunchtime and physical education. In addition, we  make sure that they attend all trips and assemblies together. We also look at their IEP's as well as teacher opinion and stream  the special education students that are ready to transition back into regular education classes. Streaming special education  students has resulted with an increase of ICT classes where students get to spend their entire day with their non-disabled  peers. We continue to look for as many opportunities to have the disabled students spend as much time as possible with their  non-disabled peers.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.     We will continue the Implementation of Ready Gen, "Senderos", Journeys, Go Math, Harcourt Science and Passport to Social  Studies  Programs for our ELLs- These curricular programs are aligned to the CCLS. By maintaining the fidelity to the strategies,  and tasks suggested by the programs we will guarantee a rigorous instruction that engages students in critical thinking, as  required by the standards. Each unit of study presented by these programs will culminate with a CCLS aligned portfolio task  and/or project that will require students to collect, analyze, and present evidence to support their claims. We will use the  scaffolding and modified activities for English Language Learners and SWD suggested by these programs to address the needs  of these two particular subgroups and offer differentiated instruction.      In addition to the daily lessons conducted as part of these programs, teachers are required to perform daily guided reading  and guided math activities; as part of a daily centers period. During these two daily periods, students will be grouped according  to their specific needs to work on pre-designed Literacy and Math center activities that help them to overcome their  difficulties and assist them in working on their problematic areas, including online programs such as A-Z Reading, Accelerated  Reading, Accelerated Math, Rally, and IXL; a math skills practice program.     Our students, including ELL’s and SWD receive several intervention programs, as indicated below:  At-risk services (e.g. provided by the Guidance Counselor, School Psychologist, Social Worker, etc.)     Students who present  challenging and unmotivated behaviors, as per teachers’ observations will receive the fowling intervention:        1. At risk ELL students are seen together with mandated students in small groups of no more than three, and on a one–to- one basis by our Guidance Counselor. Through the use of games, discussions, and role-playing activities, they receive  counseling according to their specific emotional and social needs.     2. After a screening process, ELL students are seen in a one-to-one basis by the school psychologist and social workers to  receive counseling services according to their specific needs.     3. Referrals are submitted by the teachers of ELL students to receive outside therapy and psychiatric services through our  partnership with Columbia Presbyterian Hospital and their in-house psychiatric: Small Group and One-to-One or during school  day           9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72      Through the analysis of our data, we were able to recognize the need to find a more structured program to teach Spanish  home language  reading and writing; so the ELL students in the TBE classes would develop stronger foundational language skills  in their own language. In this way, the transferring of the language skills into the target language (English) would be smother  and faster. That is the reason why we adopted the "Senderos" program in these classes with the  Journeys" counterpart guided  reading libraries to teach ENL.  These guided reading libraries in English will continue with the same thematic unit students  study in the home language, as well as the same reading skills.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?      As explained before, we will continue next year with the implementation of the three models of bilingual programs: TBE, ENL,  and DL.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   Equal access to Common Core aligned curriculum is afforded to all the students at PS4 regardless their language acquisition  levels and/or learning  disabilities, as follows:     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  School Curriculum including ELL students:    We also provide our ELL's with ELA and MATH center activities in an everyday basis which sometimes are performed using the  following online programs: IXL,Myon, Accelerated Reader, English in a Flash, and A-Z  Reading.           13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Our Bilingual Classes have received the support of having a Spanish speaker teacher who translates, summarize or preview the  lesson according to the mandated periods of LAP instruction. We also acquired the guided reading libraries  in Spanish to offer  additional support.    In addition Math instruction is being taught in Spanish using Go Math's Spanish version. Students in Free Standing ENL have  also access to books in their native language related to the topics discussed in class. They are also provided with dictionaries  and glossaries as well as reference books in Spanish.          14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All our curricular programs contain a "built-in" assessment  that includes baseline, progress monitoring and summative test.  These assessment diagnose students’ levels in order to differentiate the instruction during lessons. This data is used  in  conjunction with Accelerated Reading and Accelerated Math online tests; which we use to establish baselines, monitor the  progress of the children in a quarterly fashion and establish and update students' individual learning goals in ELA and Math.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We do not share the building with any other school.           16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   P.S. 4 does not offer any additional program for newly enrolled students before they start the school year. or during the year,  other than the differentiation strategies and Literacy and Math Center activities explained before.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We do not offer any elective language to students.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   PS 4 will start a pilot Two-Way  Dual Language Program (DL program)  in two kindergarten classes this  school year 2017-2018. In this way we will start facing off our actual transitional bilingual program in  kindergarten by replacing it with a DL program. We will be incrementing  the DL model one grade at a  time each subsequent school year. It will take five years to complete the complete transformation of our  actual TBE model into a DL model.    Our Two-Way Dual Language Program integrates Spanish proficient students (ELL's)  who are learning  English with  English proficient students who are learning Spanish. They will receive all the instruction in  English and Spanish in the same classroom to develop academic progress aligned to grade appropriate  curriculum and linguistic proficiency in both languages as follows:        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our main focus for the year is on ENL practices and methodologies and the use of data to differentiate instruction, especially  the use of the SIOP model.    What Is the SIOP Model?  The Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) Model is a research-based and validated instructional model that has  proven effective in addressing the academic needs of English learners throughout the United States.  The SIOP Model consists of eight interrelated components:  •             Lesson Preparation  •             Building Background  •             Comprehensible Input  •             Strategies  •             Interaction  •             Practice/Application  •             Lesson Delivery  •             Review & Assessment  Using instructional strategies connected to each of these components, teachers are able to design and deliver lessons that  address the academic and linguistic needs of English learners.    Who benefits from SIOP instruction?  As the number of English learners increases in schools across the United States, educators are seeking effective ways to help  them succeed in K-12 ESL, content area, and bilingual classrooms. Research shows that when teachers fully implement the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74      SIOP Model, English learners' academic performance improves. Learn about the SIOP Model research base.  In addition, teachers report that SIOP-based teaching benefits all students, not just those who are learning English as an  additional language.  SIOP instruction also benefits students learning content through another language. CAL has conducted research on adapting  the SIOP Model for use in two-way immersion (dual language) programs.    We will be focusing this year in the use of language and content objective; which is one of the main components of the SIOP  model as explained before.    The content objective tells what students will learn during the lesson. Example: “Today you will learn about the causes of the  American Revolution.”    The language objective tells how the students will learn and/or demonstrate their mastery of the lesson by reading, speaking,  writing, or listening. Example: You will be able to explain the connection between the French and Indian War and the American  Revolution.    Other Sample Content and Language Objectives  Content Objective: “Students will find the lowest common multiple (LCM) of 2 or more numbers.“    Language Objective: “You will write the steps used to solve the problems.”    We have hired the services of an independent consultant for Fordham University to perform a series of ongoing training  sessions  during the entire school year to train all our teachers in the sue of this useful strategy; which is going to be one of our  main intiatives for next year.      Other staff development opportunities include:  In addition, we will continue with our weekly grade common planning sessions, where teachers look at students data and the  curriculum pacing calendars to plan activities according to the students' needs. During common planning sessions, teachers  use the CCLS  to develop activities accordingly that demand high order thinking strategies as described by the Depth of  Knowledge. Teachers also access Engage New York in a continuous basis for additional support and ideas on planning  instructional tasks aligned to the CCLS.            2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As explained before, under new CR Regulation Part 154, we will be offering 15% of total hours of ELL-specific PD for all  teachers and 50% total hours ELL-specific PD FOR Bilingual Education and ENL teachers.       The 2017-2018 professional development committee has planned  a series of workshops that are closely related to the  identification of ENL students and how to offer instruction following the mandates of Part 154 as follows:    1. SIOP Model  3. Using the NYSESLAT data to differentiate instruction     4. Using the data EDAT report to identify growth and proficiency levels  5. Aligning the core curriculum in ENL/Bilingual Classroom  6. Bloom's Taxonomy for ELL'S- High order thinking questioning  7. A-Z Reading/RAZ Kids   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75         8. Baseline Performance Tasks  9. Organizing and planning implementation of center activities  10. Examining students work for grouping    Foe each one of these professional development opportunities, agendas are distributed and attendance is collected. These  agendas and attendance sheets are maintain in the schools'  professional development binder, as well as in the ELL binder for  the year.             Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?      As part of the the Part 154 mandates, PS 4 encourages teachers to meet with the parents or guardians of English language  learners at least once a year during the parent involvement days on Tuesdays. These meetings have the specific purpose of  discussing students' language proficiency levels, goals, progress monitoring and action plans.  these meetings are in addition to  parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled meetings.    This additional meeting should include school staff necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the child’s  language development in all content areas in English and in the child’s home language in the case of students enrolled in a  bilingual education program. Such meeting is conducted with a qualified  interpreter or translator in the language or mode of  communication the parent or guardian best understands.   A qualified interpreter or translator of the language or mode of communication the parent or guardian best understands, must  be present at each meeting. In some cases it is necessary to contact the office of translation services via phone to ask  for  simultaneous  translation in the needed language through a conferee call.        2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   One of our main goals is to increase parental involvement. We know that the success of our students depends on the  coordination of efforts among parents, teachers, and students. Since PS 4 strongly believes in parental involvement, we  encourage and welcome parents to become active participants of their children’s education. We established an open  communication with the parents throughout the school year with parent workshops, newsletter, assemblies, letters, and after  school events. Translation is available in Spanish and Creole.     Parents were surveyed and asked about their needs and ideas. This survey was the foundation to design our parent  involvement activities this year. These activities can be summarized as follows:             Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    All the necessary information was presented before.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76                       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Adam Stevens, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      As per the adult preferred language report from ATS (RAPL) , 65% of our parents prefer to communicate in  Spanish; 34% in English; and .3% in Arabic.3% in Chinese and .4% in French. We have also used the Home  Language Identification Survey ( HLIS), emergency cards, parent’s surveys, parents meetings and workshops to  determine the preferred language of communication of our parents.  We measure and assess the effectiveness of our programs through our Annual Parent Survey, as well as informal  interviews and meetings with parents. Last year parents filled out the Annual Parent Survey and indicated that  they were pleased with the translation program we have in our school.   We make sure that all the information parents receive from the school is properly translated into a language they  could understand; mostly English and Spanish. There is a small number of parents who also receive oral  information in French through one of our staff members who is fluent in that language. We have used the services  offered by the NYC Translation and Interpretation Unit for parents who speak in Chinese and Arab.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80      Parents have expressed their satisfaction with our Parent Coordinators, who are constantly in contact with them  in a language they understand.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      Communication is offered in English and Spanish through the in-house staff. Be aware that we have more than 50  staff members who speak fluent Spanish and English. The other less common languages parents will be called through  the NYC Translation and Interpretation Unit.               Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Chancellor's regulation A-663 is presented to teachers during the first day of school professional development and it is  an integral part of our staff handbook. all teachers and staff members receive the number of the NYC Translation and  Interpretation Unit, as well as the process to require simultaneous translation through a conference call. A poster is  also placed in visible location in the main office with this procedure.                Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The primary language spoken by the parent of each student is determined within 30 days of student enrollment.If  such language is not English, our school ensures that parents get language assistance in order to communicate  effectively by providing translation and interpretation services.   Parents sometimes rely on a relative or an adult friend for interpretation services for their group or one to one  meetings with different staff members. All parent notification letters are translated in house by the Parent  Coordinator.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          83      If the parents wish to be contacted in a language not spoken or written by a school staff member, our school contacts  the Translation and Interpretation Unit to acquire these services. We provide parents with a large multi- language  poster in a visible place in the main office, so they may find their language and identify it for us, so we can make the  necessary steps to serve them in their language of preference.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       After each parent workshop, a survey is distributed to determine the quality and satisfaction of the parents regarding  the school translation protocols. Feedback is used to adjust these procedures and add additional services.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          84
