This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission/Vision   Section 4: CEP Overview      At Young Voices Academy of the Bronx, it is our mission to cultivate the voice of every child and to empower all  students to become self-motivated critical thinkers who have ownership over their intellect and their ability to  influence others. We define voice not only by the words expressed by mouth but also the markings made by a pen  and the actions exhibited by individuals that influence others.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Our vision is to engage every child in a curriculum that challenges them to be and become greater critical thinkers in a  nurturing, safe and inviting environment. Our dedicated, highly qualified teachers and staff work collaboratively  within the school, with families and the community to ensure all children reach their full potential as they cultivate  the total development of each child. Students of Young Voices Academy of the Bronx, regardless of background, will  obtain the integral tools required to excel in academic, professional and social endeavor.                     2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Keeping our mission/vision at the forefront of our decision making, we have had partnerships with organizations such  as Education Through Music, NY Foundling and Neighborhood Initiatives for Development Corporation since our  founding year 2013. This year we will begin partnerships Woodlawn Cemetery, Brain Power Wellness, Elevate and  Cook Shop.   As a school focused on the intellectual, social and emotional development of every child, we foster  collaborations/partnerships that support our work to cultivate the development of every child. Our partnership with  NY Foundling began in 2013 through our partnership with Turnaround for Children. NY Foundling has and will  continue to provide our school community with an on-site mental health provider once a week. The NY Foundling  mental health provider services our students with social skills groups, small group counseling and individual  counseling at their home base. In addition they provide workshops and services for our parents as well participate in  our Child Study Team.   Education Through Music provides a music teacher three times per week. This program utilizes music education as a  catalyst to improve academic achievement, self-confidence, and nurtures the skills that can help students thrive in the  future while learning music appreciation and development. This year Education Through Music will add a Chorus  program to the school for grades 4 and 5.   Neighborhood Initiatives Development Corporation provides our school community with an after school program  which provides homework help and ELA and Math enrichment. They also provide families with summer camp  opportunities.   The following organizations will be part of our special initiatives for the 2018-2019 school year to further support our  school's mission/vision:   - Brain Power Wellness: teaches physical and mental brain breaks, mindfulness practices, and social emotional  wellness strategies that support a positive classroom atmosphere.    - Elevate: award-winning combination of student workshops, faculty training, and acclaimed classroom resources help  schools develop an integrated study skills curriculum that will engage students, foster critical thinking skills, and  establish a culture for learning that communicates high expectations.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      - Woodlawn Cemetery Student Leadership and Legacy Program: Program inspires students in the community that  need direction by creating a safe environment to explore the potential "leader" inside them, while identifying and  defining their personal path to their own legacy.   - Cookshop: teaches nutrition and physical activity information, as well as cooking skills, fostering enthusiasm for  fresh, affordable fruits, vegetables and other whole foods.   In addition we will continue our partnership with New Teacher Center and expand our teacher supports by adding an  additional Peer Collaborative Teacher, to provide our new teachers with a trained teacher mentor to support their  development as a highly effective teacher.         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our ELL student population has increased to 104 students. Of the 104 students identified as English Language  Learners their proficiency levels are as follows:   Entering 7%   Emerging 12%   Transitional 14%   Expanding 47%   Commanding 20%   To support their specific needs we have implemented the following:   - ESL self contained classes on each grade   - ENL coordinator provides students with push-in and pull out services   - An after school program is provided 2x per week for 22 weeks   - ENL Coordinator meets with ESL teachers monthly to provide ENL workshops to support strategies and scaffolds   - Imagine Learning computer based learning program      Our students with disabilities have shown specific needs in their ability to show comprehension of stories read.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Recent PPO feedback included the following:     Core values/beliefs were evident in classrooms with regard to school-wide scaffolding initiative.     Schools instructional focus of providing scaffolds for all learners; including students with disabilities and  English Language Learners is in alignment to school needs across all grades and subject areas.   Quality Review     The school’s theory of action has been evolving since its inception in 2013 and which is adjusted based on the   needs of all stakeholders. This theory is based on using multiple sources of data from assessments, teaching  practices, walkthroughs, and surveys to design school goals. Also, the school is part of a Focus Collaborative  Cohort with three other elementary schools in the district, involving interschool visits to share best practices  and receive feedback. Outcomes of these visits inform the school’s goals. All stakeholders engage in the  design of the CEP goals, working in synergy to focus on both instructional and social-emotional needs of the  school. As outlined in the school’s CEP, the school has a comprehensive tracking system which includes  teacher and student data. For example, by mid-year, school leaders will compare and analyze observation  data/feedback from the first observation cycle to measure the increase of teachers being rated effective or  highly effective in designing coherent instruction and engaging students in learning. Fountas and Pinnell (F&P)  mid-year assessments will be analyzed to monitor and measure progress, leading to adjustments for teachers,  including additional conferences with the principal, increased support from mentors or peers, and further  intervisitation to strengthen teaching practices. The result has been a 10 percent increase in students  meeting/exceeding F&P benchmarks, from 61 percent in June 2016 to 71 percent in June 2017.   Data Strength   - We exceeded our 2017-2018 CEP goal of a 5% increase in students meeting or exceeding ELA benchmark proficiency  with a 10% increase.     53% of kindergartens met or exceeded benchmark proficiency levels    69% of first graders met or exceeded benchmark proficiency levels    73% of second graders met or exceeded benchmark proficiency levels    69% of third graders met or exceeded benchmark proficiency levels    40% of fourth graders met or exceeded benchmark proficiency levels   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14      Areas of focus:     61% of our students met or exceeded benchmark expectations with a 10% decrease from the previous year    36% of ELLs met of exceeded benchmark proficiency levels    38% of IEP students met or exceeded benchmark proficiency levels        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Professional development focused on how to administer, score, and analyze data  gathered from assessments is provided to the teachers during their Monday professional development sessions as  well as individually when needed. As a professional learning community, our Turnaround for Children instructional  consultant and Generation Ready instructional consultant meet with teacher teams throughout the year to analyze  data and develop next steps for instruction.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet.

The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent Involvement Policy    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Young Voices Academy of the Bronx, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.

The focus will be on strengthening and  building students' skills around the four language domains: Listening, Speaking, Reading  and  Writing in order to increase their proficiency levels.  According to the 2017 NYSESLAT and  NYSITELL scores,  students in grades 1-4 performed below proficiency across the four language  domains.  Of the 20 students in grades 1-2, 16 scored below proficiency in the listening domain,  2 in speaking, 13 in reading and 9 in writing.  Of the 29 students in grades 3-4, 21 scored below  proficiency in the listening domain, 17 in speaking, 19 in reading and 18 in writing.  Based on  this data, ELL students in grades 1-4 will receive direct instruction through flexible groupings  for an additional hour and a half as part of our after school program.The after school program  will run in two cycles. Cycle 1 will begin October 2018 through December 2018.  It will take  place on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 2:50 - 4:20pm for a total of 16 sessions.  The  instruction will be provided in English by 3 ENL/Bilingual teachers.  Cycle 1 will include  students in grades 3-4.  Students in grades 3-4  will be grouped by proficiency level according to  grade bands. The 35 ELLs in grades 3-4 will be split into 3 classes. The 27  transitioning/expanding ELL students will be split into 2 classes and will be instructed by 2  Bilingual teachers.  The 8 entering and emerging students will be instructed by the ENL  teacher.  Students in grades 3-4 will receive direct instruction using a combination of workshop  model (45 minutes) and literacy center based model (45 minutes).  During the literacy center  based model, there will be three centers going on: 1) Imagine Learning computer based center, 2)  Small group skills instruction using NYSESLAT instructional materials, and 3) Independent  reading/independent writing center.  Cycle 2 will include students in grades 1-2 and will begin  January 2019 through April 2019.  It will take place on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 2:50- 4:20 for a total of 17 sessions.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  As a school we are assessing students using the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment kits. We assess their letter  identification, phonemic awareness, and reading ability. The data obtained from these assessments are analyzed to group  students for small group instruction and grouped for targeted instruction as well as interventions.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Every classroom has a literacy block where guided reading and other small group instruction take place. For some of our ELL  students there are extra resources provided, such as Fundations and Max Scholars, which is a computer based program that  strengthens students' phonic skills and phonemic awareness.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         We evaluate the success of our ENL program by students' progress on the NYSESLAT exam, as well as any progress on MOSL  assessments.  We also use the data from the NYSITELL to plan and program newly identified ELLs accordingly. In addition, we  use i-ready in order to identify the students' stregths and weaknesses in reading and math.  Teachers also administer pre and  post assessments for the different units of studies across subject areas.  This information is then used to assess students  progress and plan for additional support or interventions.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The ENL Coordinator services all ELLs who are not  with a TESOL certified teacher according to their English proficiency levels.  Students who are entering/emerging are grouped in similar grade bands and are provided with 360 minutes of  ENL services  per week (180 minutes standalone ENL and 180  minutes integrated ENL).  The transitioning and expanding ELLs are provided  with 180 minutes of integrated ENL and the commanding ELLs receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL per week.  In addition to  providing ENL services, the  ELL students are also given the opportunity to participate in the after school program that is  funded by Title III to strengthen and build students' skills around the four language domains: Listening, Speaking, Reading  and  Writing in order to increase their proficiency levels. Within the after school program, students receive direct instruction  through flexible groupings using the workshop and literacy center based models. For the ELLs who are performing below grade  level, the AIS instructor provides additional support through the use of Fundations, Leveled Literacy Intervention and Max  Scholars.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   After completing benchmark assessments we use the RTI guide to inform instructional decisions. As part of Tier 1 we select a  rigorous evidence based curriculum, Core Knowledge, to provide instruction for all ELLs using appropriate scaffolds to give  students access to the curriculum.  We modify lessons to include language objectives and other supports for ELLs where  appropriate, such as linguistic frames, visuals and gestures. As part of Tier II or III we have small group targeted instruction  using additional materials/resources provided by curriculum specifically for ELLs, such as Imagine Learning and Words Their  Way for additional support.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We use the RLAT report to evaluate the NYSESLAT results in order to analyze the data and assess students growth in each  modality across the proficiency levels. We also use the ELL Data Analysis Tool to identify trends and patterns that will inform  our instruction and determine other factors such as home language, years of ELL service, and NYSESLAT proficiency and  progress, among others.   After analyzing the RLAT report and reviewing the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data from the 2017  NYSESLAT exam, the data reveals that students across the different grades have shown growth with 69% of the entering and  emerging students moving to the transitioning and expanding levels and 85% of the transitioning students moving to the  expanding level. However, the data also reveals that more targeted instruction is needed for 35% of our NYSESLAT 2017 test  takers who remained on the same level with one of the main focus areas being writing.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Based on the NYSESLAT results students are broken into groups according to their grade and proficiency levels and the ENL  Coordinator provides them with the necessary standalone and integrated ENL minutes per week.  We also implement the after  school program for ELLs to strengthen and build students' skills around the four language domains/modalities: Listening,  Speaking, Reading  and Writing in order to increase their proficiency levels.  For the ELLs who are performing below grade  level, the AIS instructor provides additional support through the use of Fundations, Leveled Literacy Intervention and Max  Scholars.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Young Voices Academy will serve students in grades K-4. Students identified as ELLs are placed in a self-contained ENL  class where their minutes are provided by a TESOL certified teacher or the ENL Coordinator.  ELLs who are placed in  ICT or general education classrooms receive their standalone and integrated minutes by the ENL Coordinator. Within  the classroom, students are engaged in learning using homogeneous and hetergeneous groupings. During standalone  instruction, ELLs are grouped by proficiency levels and consecutive grade bands. Students who are entering/emerging  and in consecutive grade bands are grouped together and provided with 360 minutes of  ENL services per week (180  minutes standalone ENL and 180  minutes integrated ENL).  The transitioning and expanding ELLs are provided with  180 minutes of integrated ENL and the commanding ELLs receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL per week.  In addition,  one block per day students travel together to receive targeted instruction. During this block students are  homogeneously grouped.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A       2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?             The ENL classroom teachers provide students with ENL services throughout the day embedded in their daily instruction  by incorporating language objectives and the use of appropriate scaffolds. Each teacher also sets aside a period a day when all  the ELLs travel for targeted instruction.  In addition, ELL students receive the appropriate standalone and integrated ENL  minutes by the ENL Coordinator or TESOL certified teacher according to their proficiency levels and based on the CR Part 154  requirements. Students who are entering/emerging and in consecutive grade bands are grouped together and provided with  360 minutes of  ENL services per week. For entering level students,  the 360 minutes consists of 180 minutes standalone ENL  and 180  minutes of integrated ENL.  For emerging level students,  the 360 minutes  consists of 90 minutes standalone ENL,  180 minutes of integrated ENL and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL /content area based on their language or  academic needs. The transitioning ELLs are provided with 180 minutes of ENL services, which consists of 90 minutes of  integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of integrated ENL/content area.  Expanding level students receive 180 minutes of ENL/ELA  or other content area based on their needs.  The commanding or former ELLs receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA per  week.  Based on these CR Part 154 requirements, all ELLs are programmed in STARS and the ELL Data Update Report (EDUR) is  reviewed on a monthly basis to ensure all ENL students are indentified and programmed accordingly.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      All classroom instruction regardless of content area is delivered in English. For ELLs with lower English proficiency levels,  home language support may be provided by teachers or students with the same home languages. Teachers use realia, picture  support, extensive modeling, exemplars, and appropriate scaffolds throughout their instruction. Language objectives are set  for lessons. Students are challenged to ask and answer questions that are text based using the Cognitive Rigor Matrix. Students  engage in a great deal of cooperative learning activities to allow students to partake in meaningful conversations with their  peers as well as the teacher. Lessons are aligned to the common core standards and differentiated as needed using UDL and  the Language Acquisition Progressions. Our curriculum consist of Core Knowledge and Lucy Caulkins Units of Study (ELA), Go  Math and FOSS (Science).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?       Young Voices Academy does not implement a bilingual or dual language program. Students are assessed in English. MOSL  materials and Math State exams are provided in students' home languages and used for students as needed.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    We do not have SIFE students but in the event a newly admitted student is identified as such, we provide them with home  language support when needed and small group instruction to develop their oral language and vocabulary.  The same thing  applies to newcomers.  Both these subgroups receive ENL minutes accordingly and are provided with appropriate scaffolds  based on the Language Acquisition Progressions to give them access to the curriculum.  They will also receive small group  instruction from their classroom teachers and are monitored to assess progress as well as need for AIS.  Developing and Long  term ELLs are also provided with small group targeted instruction across subject areas by the teacher and ENL provider.  They  also participate in the ENL after school program to help strengthen and build their skills around the four language domains:  Listening, Speaking, Reading  and Writing in order to increase their proficiency levels.  Former ELLs receive 90 minutes of  integrated ENL/ELA or other content area for an additional two years and they are eligible for certain specified testing  accommodations. Former ELLs also receive AIS support based on their academic needs as well as small group instruction from  their classroom teacher and/or ENL provider.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The ENL teacher and special education teacher provide targeted instruction during all content areas and incorporate oral  language opportunities that support the students listening and speaking skills. Teachers use the materials and resources  provided by their curriculum programs, which are grade appropriate, using differentiated instruction and scaffolds that give  students access to the curriculum. With desktops, laptops and ipads in every classroom students use Imagine Learning, MyOn  Reading, i-ready, Max Scholars and Learning A-Z to support their learning. Teachers use Smart Board technology and document  cameras to provide visual support for ELL-SWD students.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  We use flexible programming allowing our ELL-SWDs to receive their needed services/instruction to reach their IEP  goals. Students who are identified as having special needs are provided with appropriate scaffolds, differentiated materials  and visuals to aid in content comprehension.They are provided with grade-level materials that are differentiated to meet their  goals as identified on their IEPs. They also receive SETTS mandated services and are programmed for the appropriate  standalone or integrated ENL/ELA or other content area minutes according to their English proficiency levels.            8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).

Intervention services in ELA include differentiating instruction based on various entry level needs, targeted small group  instruction using Words Their Way, Fountas and Pinnell Intervention kits, Learning A-Z, Max Scholars and Imagine Learning. In  all content areas students receive small group targeted instruction based on data. Teachers also create targeted scaffolds for  their ELLs. Teachers use formal and informal assessments to inform their targeted intervention services. These intervention  services are offered in English with some home language support based on students' needs and proficiency level.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Words Their Way, Max Scholars and i-ready are programs that will be utilized in the upcoming school year.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         10.

Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All students in our school have access to services that will support their academic success. Students are provided with AIS  services based on their needs. ELLs are also part of our after school program, Neighborhood Initiatives Development  Corporation which provides homework help and ELA and Math support through activities that are aligned with our curriculum.  In addition, ELLs are given the opportunity to participate in the ENL after school program funded by Title III.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Each classroom has document cameras, which allow teachers to provide explicit modeling, as well as display read alouds,  student work, vocabulary or any exemplar pieces. ELLs have access to laptops, ipads and desktops in every classroom where  they use programs, such as MyON, i-ready, Max Scholars, Learning A-Z and Imagine Learning. Teachers in the ENL after  schoolprogram also utilize NYSESLAT instructional support materials to enhance students' learning and help increase their  proficiency levels across the four language domains/modalities. Teachers also include language objectives and appropriate  scaffolds to ensure that all students, including ELLs, have access to the curriculum.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Young Voices Academy does not implement a bilingual or dual language program at the moment. Assessments and instruction  are delivered in English with home language support provided when needed and based on students proficiency levels  (especially for Entering and Emerging students). MOSL materials, Math State exams and glossaries are provided in students'  home languages and used for students as needed. Staff members and teachers communicate with students in their home  language and students work with peers in their native language if needed.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All ELLs are placed in their appropriate grade level upon arrival. Materials and resources used are developmentally appropriate  and on grade level. In addition, language acquisition progressions are used to provide appropriate scaffolds based on grade  and proficiency levels.      15.

(Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The Professional Learning Committee designs a plan for professional development that is aligned with the instructional focus  of the school. The plan includes all staff members who work with ELL students, including classroom teachers, cluster teachers,  educational assistants, parent coordinator, counselor, and all other staff members. Topics covered but are not limited to 2nd  language acquisition, lesson planning using language objectives and the Language Acquisition Progressions and the  identification and placement of ELL students.  Staff development for teachers to learn ENL methodologies and strategies will  also be provided. Topics covered during the scheduled staff development include exposure to the NYSESLAT test format in  order to align it with the content taught in the classroom to enhance ELLs learning and help increase their proficiency levels  across the modalities, and the process of identification and placement of ELL students in differentiated groups. Various forms  of differentiated instruction discussed include the use of seating arrangement to improve the opportunities for interaction and  acquisition of education in the context of social climate, the use of cognates to facilitate vocabulary development, and  promoting a safe environment where ELL students feel free to take risks as they engage with the new language. The critical  aspect of the relationship with the parents is covered as well as how to communicate effectively with both parents and  caregivers. The use of cooperative learning to promote interaction among students and the development of scaffolding  activities will help ELL students organize their thoughts and develop comprehension. All records, including agendas and sign in  sheets will be kept on file in the main office.     2.

Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Teachers provide parents with their email addresses to keep constant communication of student and parent needs. They also  communicate with parents and guardians face to face, over the phone or through the use of applications, such as Remind and  Class Dojo. Once a week teachers dedicate a period for parent involvement meetings to discuss student progress and address  any concerns. In addition, teachers develop and present workshops to provide parents with strategies and activities to support  their children at home. Translation in Spanish is provided at all workshops and translators are provided in languages identified  in HLIS during school wide events. In addition, the ENL Coordinator sends home the entitlement and non-entitlement letters  within the first 10 days of school to notify parents of the ELL status of students and communicates regularly with the parents  and teachers of the ELLs.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Young Voices Academy of the Bx                                                                              School DBN: 11X357  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      At Young Voices Academy of the Bronx we review the Home Language Identification Surveys completed by  parents at registration to identify which languages are used at home (oral, written and read). An informal oral  language survey is conducted with the child to further identify the language needs at home. Teachers also review  Emergency Contact Blue Cards to identify home language needs. In addition, we review ATS reports, such as the  Place of Birth report (RPOB), and the Adult preferred language reports (RAPL and RCPL) to identify parents’  preferred spoken and written language. ENL teachers along with Testing Coordinator review all documents to  identify commonality and trends. This information is used to determine the language translation that is mostly  needed and determine which languages will need the help of outside services/vendors.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67       2.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We distribute and review a beginning of year parent survey to gather parent feedback in order to provide the  required services and make appropriate adjustments. In addition, parents are also provided with question and answer  sessions after parent meetings/workshops so that we could receive verbal and written feedback from parents as well.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70
