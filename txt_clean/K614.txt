This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission Statement   Our mission is to empower confident and compassionate leaders.   The Young Women’s Leadership School of Brooklyn (TYWLS of Brooklyn) was established to nurture the intellectual  curiosity and creativity of young women and to address their developmental needs. Learning is dynamic and  participatory, enabling students to experience great success on many levels, especially in science, mathematics, and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      technology.At TYWLS of Brooklyn, students are encouraged to achieve their personal best in and out of the classroom.  Teachers will deliberately make connections to students’ lives, prior knowledge, and the world. Through advisory,  small class size, and ongoing assessments, students will be known well by the adults in the building. Thus, learning will  be tailored to students’ interests, needs, and strengths. Students will be challenged and supported so that they will be  prepared for higher level courses throughout middle and high school. Students of TYWLS of Brooklyn will grow  academically and emotionally into leaders of their school, community, and the world. TYWLS strives to work with  families to instill in all students a sense of community, responsibility, and ethical principles of behavior- characteristics  that will help to make them leaders of their generation. Through exposure to technology, engagement in community  service, and participation in action-research and interdisciplinary projects, students will find their voice and take  responsibility for their community.

Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The Young Women’s Leadership School of Brooklyn is a middle/high school with 380 students from sixth through  twelve. The school population comprises 52% Black, 37% Hispanic, 2% White, 4% Asian and 3% other students. The  student body includes 5.3% English language learners and 16.3% special education students. Girls account for 100% of  the students enrolled.   The Young Women's Leadership School of Brooklyn focuses on empowering young women. Our school was  established in 2008 to nurture the intellectual curiosity and creativity of young women by supporting the “whole girl”  in order to maximize academic achievement, social-emotional well-being, and post secondary success. TYWLS  Brooklyn is supported by the Young Women’s Leadership Network and its CollegeBound Initiative to replicate the best  practices of private and independent girls’ schools. At our school, learning is dynamic and participatory, enabling  students to experience great success on many levels, especially in the STEM subjects: science, mathematics and  technology. Girls’ education research guides the TYWLS model, an academically rigorous program fused with strong  social-emotional support that forms the basis of TYWLS’ “whole girl” approach to education. Students are encouraged  to achieve their personal best both in and out of classroom, as we strive to work with families to install in our  students a sense of community, responsibility, and ethical principles of behavior—characteristics that will help make  them leaders of their generation. TYWLS, Brooklyn students have the opportunity to attend yearly international trips  to destinations such as China, Italy, France and London, as well as regular college trips throughout the year.    We have many strategic partnerships, including with the College Bound Initiative which helps us organize college visits  and provides us with a college counselor who helps to lead our 12th grade team in that work. We also partner with  Student Leadership Network (formerly YWLN) which provides us with much PD, many special opportunities for  students (like trips to Broadway and a summer STEM program) and help linking us to other partnerships (such as Peer  Health Exchange.) We also have a strategic partnership with New Visions and we're part of their Post Secondary  Success Grant through the Gates Foundation this year.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   7% of students enrolled are ENLs, with a number of these students also being SIFEs. They receive regular ENL pull out  and push in services. Their needs include needing to learn phonics, needing to learn basic writing skills, including  organizing writing assignments, and more.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      16.3% of students enrolled are special education students whom receive services in accordance with their IEPs. Their  needs are varied, but often include that they are reading below grade level. Some also lack understanding of basic  mathematical concepts.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Over the past year, we made the most progress in rigorous instruction and trust, but we still have a long way to go.

The school’s hiring committee is comprised of teachers and administrators, and includes three rounds of interviews  throughout which committee members have several opportunities to share what it means to work at our school with  applicants and applicants have opportunities to ask questions. All staff members are assigned a leadership position  (i.e., teacher leader, club coordinator, or event coordinator). Teachers have the opportunity to apply for Travelship  grants via the Young Women’s Leadership Network. We meet with teachers regularly to discuss their intentions and  how we can support their career plans within the school whenever possible. We have whole staff professional  learning as well as teacher team meetings that teachers improve their skills and feel supported. Each teacher who is  new to our building has a mentor who meets with them weekly.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Teachers attend regular outside PD, especially those teaching AP courses or who teach in a subject area in which we  have a partnership; Science teachers have access to Urban Advantage PD, and teachers participate in the New Visions  PD groups (Living Environment, A2i, Social Studies). The PD Planning Committee is comprised of teacher leaders and  at least one new teacher each year. They meet weekly to plan high quality PD to meet school-wide goals. 4 teachers  are part of Math for America. Teachers do quality inquiry work in weekly department team meetings in which they  look at student work and create action plans for taking students to the next level.

Admin and  teachers talk together to decide on appropriate assessments for students.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.          Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.   The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The Young Women’s Leadership School of Brooklyn, in compliance with the   Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and   the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and   decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the   School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed   members of the school community.

Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community. The Young Women’s Leadership School of Brooklyn will support parents and families of Title I students   by:     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and   decision making in support of the education of their children;   e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39         fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and   monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and        providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and   in languages that parents can understand;   other members of the school community;   This will include the following events and more, organized by parent coordinator Martha Reyes, in conjunction with   the PTA president and admin:   -September 2018 Dads to School day in which dads attend their daughters' classes for a morning   -September 2018 Jumprope (grade program) training for parents at back to school night   -Fall 2018 Sports and Arts Foundation parent night for after school showcase   -November 2018 parent association meeting will include a workshop with our director of college counseling to better   understand how they can support their students in become college ready.   -December 2018 parent association meeting will include a workshop with our nurse on how to support a healthy   family   -January 2019 parent association meeting will include a teacher explaining the Regents process to students.      The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all   parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement   policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school   surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and   enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.      In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for   additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s   Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of   the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;    ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and   strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;      support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the   Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Beginner ELLs will participate  in the Bridges curriculum (which we began using in 2018-19) during the school day and will  have it supplemented after school.  Higher-level ELLs will also receive higher level instruction  during the day, based on their needs, which will also be supplemented after school  The Title 3 program will consist of a two part program separated by grade level, (middle school  and high school).  In MS the focus will compromise of literacy development through humanities  and science.  The participating ELLS in this actitvity will be organized by level according to  the  2018 NYSESLAT and/or NYSITELL scores .  The MS students will be participating in  these sessions during after-school hours from 2:30:00-4:00pm on Wednesdays &  Thursdays since After School PD take place on Mondays and Tuesdays.  All services will be  provided in English as well as utilizing Spanish, Arabic, or other languages when needed for  newcomer ELLs.  All MS ENL students are invited to attend the After School program from the  hours of 2:30- 4:000 pm. The program will be running from October 2018 to April 2019 for  approximately 25 sessions.  Our certified ESL teacher will give language support, have students  work on fundamentals of literacy and have "student helpers" (former ELLs) assist. Students will  work with a variety of materials, including books in English at (or just above) their level, books  in their home language (usually Spanish or Arabic) and laptops with applications including  newsela.  Students will be seated at round tables.  Other relevant materials that will be utilized  include textbooks, laptops, ipads, chartpaper, markers, a projector, dictionaries, and access to  library books.  Students will practice their academic skills using academic interventions such as   text-based  discussions,   independent reading, and literacy in math problems. Based on the level of success  achieved by the students and rise in NYSESLAT scores this program is designed to help these  students achieve further success.    Intensive language development and enrichment activities through cloze reading practices and  activities supported with iBooks on Mac computers, iPads and Mini-iPads will be provided for  students. Students will develop their reading levels by increasing their academic vocabulary and  reading fluency skills by practicing reading and writing skills.  High interest at level reading will  be the primary tool, which will increase in level as the students show language development. In  addition, students will engage in structured content-based reading (i.e. math, science, history,  etc.) discussion circles based on their individual book selection from the iBooks application  library, and classroom library.  Students will acquire content specific reading skills and  vocabulary in order to explore essential understandings in science, math and social studies. Text  selections will range from entering to commanding in order to meet students’ language levels.    In addition to all of this we will offer a Saturday Academy of our HS ELLs  in grades 9-12. The  instructional focus will be Regents instruction in  social studies, ELA, science and math  content.  Evidence-based writing projects will run parallel to at-level reading activities in  preparation for the English Regents Examination.  Part of our focus will  be on acceleration of  students’ content knowledge.   This program will run on Saturday from 9am -11am for a total of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   14 sessions. Seven of these sessions will take in the winter before January Regents  administration and seven will take place in the Spring before June Regents administration. The  service providers are comprised of certified teachers;  one ENL teacher, one SS teacher, one  English teacher, one math teacher, and one science teacher. The ENL will team teach with each  of the content teacher for 1 hour to provide the language level support. Teacher may use Regents  Prep material, use of bilingual dictionaries/glossaries, and Barron's Regents text.    Materials for both program activities will be charged to title 3 funding, and be complemented by  other funding source. Attendance as well as student assessment portfolio will be kept on file.

The plan for this year is for those  trained teachers, led by Elizabeth Adkisson,  to turnkey the strategies and interventions they  learned to other teachers during department team meetings which meet on Tuesday for a 45-90  minutes.      We will also take this time to train other teachers using this professional development as we have  many first year teachers who can use the information gained through QTEL and the Teacher's  College Reading and Writing project to address the learning needs of the ELL students in their  classrooms.   In addition, many of our staff have been trained by former TCRWP Consultant,  Carla Espana,  who is a former ELL herself  and just completed a PhD in Teaching of English  Language Learners.  We will use the scaffolding strategies she taught us to help each department  team understand and then plan scaffolding in their subject area. This PD will include how to  understand ELL levels and  how and where to locate reading material that can meet reading  targets for English Language Learners.    Topics Include but are not limited to:      - Book Clubs and Partner Talk for English Language Learners  - Busting Myths About ELLs: What We Know About Multilingual Learners  - Embracing Digital Literacy and Classroom Technology  - The Art of Evidence-based Argument: Critical Reading    All records such as attendance, agenda will be kept on file.

We will provide monthly workshops,  held on the first Wednesday of the month that take place during the hours of 6:00-7:30 pm, at the  school about the variety of topics that would be of interest to ELL parents.  These sessions will  present information on a variety of topics including citizenship, the rights of ELL parents and  students, use of New Visions student trackers and Skedula Program, and academic interventions  parents of ELLs can provide at home.   This will be in conjunction with Parent Association  meetings. We will also focus on teaching parents about the technology resources they have  available to them through the school in order to communicate with teachers as well as check in  on their children’s academic progress.  Other topics will be determined by a survey of what  parents would like to see covered at these workshops. These meetings are presented bilingually  in which each parent of the meeting is translated to accommodate the parents.   We will provide  translation for parents at these meetings.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  ELL reading levels are continuously assessed according to the TCRWP Running Records. These assessments reveal that all of  our ELLs are below grade level benchmarks in literacy, especially our newcomers. Of our students who were enrolled this year,  three students were at a level B, one was at a level D, and another was at a level O. This demonstrates that our newcomers are  significantly below grade level in English literacy. In response to this data, teachers have been assigning ELLs leveled readers  and content at a lower elementary level. Furthermore, reading levels for our transitioning ELLs are still far below grade level,  as they entered this year at the H level. In response to this data, reading is targeted in pull out ENL classes and ENL push  in/small group instruction. Moreover, teachers are focusing on close reading strategies across the curriculum. ELLs are taught  strategies to increase their comprehension; they are especially encouraged to chunk readings, look for familiar words and  cognates, and use headings and pictures to gather the main idea.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Department team meetings with embedded language work; programming that allows ENL students time with their ENL  teacher and others for extra support.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of our ELL program is evaluated through the use of assessments such as Running Records (using Teachers College  materials), Edperformance, teacher-created assessments, and the NYSESLAT. In the past two years 6 students have tested  Proficient/Commanding on the NYSESLAT. Last year, 5 out of 9 students made progress on the NYSESLAT, moving to the next  level, while 4 students remained at their current level. Three of the students who did not show significant progress were  longterm ELLs and SWDs. These students are receiving extra support through programs such as ICT and SETSS.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    programming that allows ENL students time with their ENL teacher and others for extra support.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We have students who are performing at all levels across all of our grades. Newcomers are performing at the entering level,  while ELLs who have been here for 3 years or more are at the transitioning and expanding levels. Additionally, there were 5  newcomers this year who were new to the DOE. 4 out of 5 of them scored at the Entering level on the NYSITELL, and this is  true across their grade levels (grades 6, 7, 9, 10). One 11  th   grader came from Hait and she scored Expanding on the  NYSITELL.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Assessment sharing in grade and department teams, both in email and through sharing spreadsheets         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.    ENL students are grouped according to class section in each grade. These students travel together. They are in  heterogenous groups. Entering-Transitioning ELLs are pulled out to received standalone ENL, and they also received  integrated ENL in their classes through push in services offered by the ENL teacher, Elizabeth Adkisson. In the same  manner, ELLs of all levels receive integrated push in services. Entering-Transitioning level ELLs also receive instruction  during a 9  th   period stand alone ENL class. Push in and Pull out schedules are created in collaboration between the  ENL coordinator, Elizabeth Adkisson, and the Principal, Catherine Mitchell, in order to ensure that students receive  the instruction that is mandated by CR Part 154.2.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              ENL push in and pull out services are scheduled based on the requirements set out in CR Part 154.2. Based on students'  NYSELSAT levels, the ENL coordinator, Elizabeth Adkisson, along with Catherine Mitchell, Principal, decide how best to serve  our ELLs by offering them their mandated minutes. Entering High SchoolELLs receive 540 minutes of instruction, 360 minutes  of which is standalone ENL. This is accomplished through pull out ENL services throughout the week (Entering ELLs receive 8  periods of pull out instruction). The remaining 180 minutes are delivered through integrated push in ENL services, through 4  period of push in with the students' content classes (currently social studies classes). Likewise, Emerging ELLs receive 360  minutes in total, with at least 180 minutes of standalone ENL and the additional 180 minutes provided through push in  services. Transitioning ELLs receive have of their services (90 minutes) through freestanding ENL and the other half through  integrated ENL . Finally, Expanding ELLs receive all of their 180 minutes through integrated ENL. Our middle school ELLs are  served in a similar manner, with our Entering and Emerging ELLs receiving instruction through a standalone ENL program  offered during 9  th   period 4 times a week (180 minutes). The rest of their instruction (180) minutes is received through  integrated ENL through collaboration with the ENL teacher and their ELA teacher. Likewise, Transitioning and Expanding ELLs  receive all of their 180 minutes through ENL integrated services.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Core content is primarily delivered in English by content area teachers. However, students native language is also utilized,  especially Spanish. Students receive bilingual support from the ENL teacher, Ms. Adkisson. With the support of Ms. Adkisson  and Mr. Calixto, teachers utilize class materials insome  students' native language (Spanish) and assess students in Spanish. For  students who speak other languages, fewer materials in the home language are provided. However, students are encouraged  to use bilingual glossaries during their content instruction. Furthermore, teachers work to differentiate their content work in  English. Teachers draw support from websites such as EdHelper in order to differentiate instruction and provide materials at  the levels of our ELLs. Ells receive further support from push in and small group pull out sessions, during which the ENL teacher  works with them on the content that their teacher is focusing on, primarily in ELA and Social Studies. The ENL teacher provides  contehnt support by meeting weekly with content teachers and discussing approaches to assessment and differentiation, as  well as by pushing into the classroom and working with students in small groups. The ENL teacher assists content teachers in  locating materials in students' home language and materials suitable for students' levels. These materials include videos and  low level materials which include simplifies language and many images. Teachers also take advantage of internet resources,  such as BrainPOP, to ensure that students are engaged in material that they can comprehend.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?     ELLs who speak Spanish are evaluated in Spanish by our ENL teacher. We do Spanish running records.         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      SIFE and Newcomer students receive more support in their home language. They are encouraged to read in their home  language and often completed assignments in their home language. Content work is significantly differentiated and scaffolded  to their level, and they are often grouped with more advanced students who speak the same language at home. Developing  ELLs complete most of their work in English, although they are still encouraged to read in their home language. They may still  receievd instruction and materials in their home language in some Regents classes, as they often choose to take the Regents in  their native language. Long Term ELLs tend to be SWDs, and as such are always placed into ICT and SETSS programs. These  students work both with the ENL teacher and special education teachers. Former ELLs continue to receive differentiated  instruction based on the recommendation of the ENL teacher and their content teachers. Former ELLs and Expanding ELLs  receive instruction through integrated ENL (180 minutes weekly). The ENL teacher works with the content teachers, primarily  in ELA and Social Studies, in order to differentiate for these students. Lastly, all ELLs and former ELLs (for two years) receive  testing accommodations, such as time and a half, bilingual glossories, a separate location, and testing or translation services in  their home language.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers use programs such as Wilson or Recipe for Reading in order to promote literacy development among SWDs. ELA and  ENL teachers also provide students with leveled readers at the developmentally appropriate level. Teachers use appropriate  ENL and SPED strategies to differentiate work for these students by chunking texts, providing students with translations of  important words, and picture dictionaries. Teachers include simplified language in their instruction, and are sure to repeat  important academic vocabulary multiple times throughout the lesson. These words are accompanied by images, and teachers  also provide bilingual glossories and simpliefied definitions of vocabulary words. Math teachers and SPED teachers work with  these students individually and in small groups during class in their ICT and during SETSS pull out classes. Teachers         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Students received support from SPED teachers in their ICT clases. Based on their IEP, students may also receive SETSS services  and ENL push in and pull out services. However, all SWD's spend the majority of their day and take all of their content classes  with their non-disabled peers.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Longterm ELLs and SWDs are targeted through SETSS and ICT classes in all of their core classes. In math, Entering and Emerging  ELLs, as well as SIFE students at higher levels, work with SPED teachers one-on-one to increase their skills in algebra (high  school) and basic mathematics (middle school). Furthermore, high school students who did not pass the Algebra Regents are  targeted through a 9  th   period Algebra Extension class. In ELA, middle school ELLs are targeted through a literacy  intervention program called CARES (Comprehension and Reading Extended Support). All targeted intervention programs are  offered in English. However, out Algebra teacher is able to offer support in Spanish as well (although the primary language of  instruction is still English and it is not a bilingual program).      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We are currently exploring how we can further assist ELLs through itegrated ENL by hiring more teachers with a TESOL  extension and by offering more opportunities for our content teachers to attend ENL PD events.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   There will be no programs that will be discontinued for ELLs.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs have the same opportunities afforded to all students. ELLs are encouraged to attend after school help sessions with  teachers and join clubs that help them to integrate into the school community. ELLs are involved in dance and music clubs, as  well as a mural/art club. Middle school ELLs attend SASF. ELLs receive pull out support with the ENL teacher. In this way, they  create a community with each other. ELLs are also integrated into the community through advisory. Advisories are kept small  (around 13 students) and students are able to develop relationships with their peers, as well as with their advisor.         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  ELLs work with leveled readers in ELA. ELLs at the Entering and Emerging levels read teacher provided books in their home  language in ELA. Entering ELLs are also provided with chromebooks, which they carry from class to class. Primarily in ELA, but  in content classes as well, these students complete independent, teacher directed work on Starfall and brainPOP. In content  classes, such as science and social studies, teachers utilize videos and computer programs such as Starfall and BrainPOP.  Students at the Emerging level and above utilize NEWSELA, a levled reader news website for students, in ELA and content  classes. Additionally, students are given dictionaries, which they are encouraged to use across all classes. Content teachers in  math, science, and social studies, also have specific glossories that assist students with the relavant high frequency academic  language for those classes.          13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is delivered in spanish through bilingual teaching strategies provided by bilingual certified teachers  and the ENL/Spanish teacher. Students are frequently grouped with more advanced students who speak the same langauge at  home.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   It is the responsibility of the ENL coordinator, as well as content and SPED teachers, to ensure that ELLs are receving the  resources and support they need. ELLs are regularly assessed by the ENL teacher, who meets with their content teachers in  grade team meetings. At these meetings, teachers discuss what services/resources would best meet our ELLs needs.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    ELLs work with leveled readers in ELA. ELLs at the Entering and Emerging levels read teacher provided books in their home  language in ELA. Entering ELLs are also provided with chromebooks, which they carry from class to class. Primarily in ELA, but  in content classes as well, these students complete independent, teacher directed work on Starfall and brainPOP. In content  classes, such as science and social studies, teachers utilize videos and computer programs such as Starfall and BrainPOP.  Students at the Emerging level and above utilize NEWSELA, a levled reader news website for students, in ELA and content  classes. Additionally, students are given dictionaries, which they are encouraged to use across all classes. Content teachers in  math, science, and social studies, also have specific glossories that assist students with the relavant high frequency academic  language for those classes.          16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELLs are immediately introduced to other ELLs at the school by the guidance counselor and the ENL teacher.  They are scheduled for pull out services, or encouraged to come meet during lunch and after school with the ENL teacher and  other ELLs. Students are placed into an advisory, where they get to form relationships with a smaller number of students, as  well as their advisor. Before the school year, students participate in a Summer Bridge program, during which they meet other   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         students and teachers, participate in team building activities, and learn more about school policies and available programs.  Throughout the year, students attend various field trips and out of school events organized by different grade teams. High  School students also participate in iMentor every week.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Middle school Spanish, and Spanish I, II and III in high school.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   To support staff in assisting ELLs as they transition to new levels, the ENL coordinator conferences with staff both individually  and in whole staff meetings to advise them on stategies to assist students in higher level work.  Topics include importance of  four language modalities, need for explicit instruction and use of multiple intelligences to heighten language acquisition all  geared toward deepening ELLs knowledge at higher levels of understanding.     Furthermore, staff receive specific PD relative to best practices for ELLs during PLT throughout the school year. ELA, ENL, and  content teachers attend PD events at New Visions and TC.     Teachers attend PD events at New Visions and TC.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As students transition to Middle School or High School, they attend an event called Summer Bridge, where they are able to  meet their peers and teachers. Teachers are able to assess students language abilities and begin to forge relationships with  them. Staff meets with the ENL coordinator early in the year and throughout the year in order to discuss best practices for  these students.  The ENL coordinator liases with the head of each department as well.      Requirements are met through a mix of in house and out of house PD events. Records are kept by administration.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61            Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL coordinator schedules one-on-one meetings with parents of ELLs at least once a year, but more times for newcomers.  Parents are also updated regulary via phone calls. Parents speak either English or Spanish with our ENL coordinator and our  parent outreach coordinator. If parents request a different language, a translator is hired or called through the DOE translation  services.        2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents are encourages to join the PTA, come to PTA and budget meetings, PTA sponsiored events, and parent-teacher  conferences. Parents are also encourages to attend school wide events and performances, such as the talent shows, plays, and  musical performances. The parent outreach coordinator reaches out to these parents in regards to attendance to meetings  and parent-teacher conferences. The ENL coordinator also reaches out to parents to schedule meetings and invite them to  special events. Letters and phone calls are sent home in English and in the parents language of choice for school  communication (as per their choice on the HLIS).

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Catherine Mitchell, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Young Women's Leadership Schoo                                                                              School DBN: 14k614  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
