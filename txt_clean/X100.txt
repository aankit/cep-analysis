This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At PS 100, we share the vision and true belief that all students in under our care will be able to achieve personal  success today in order to be prepared for tomorrow. Our mission in service of this vision is to ensure that all  children can and will meet high standards through equitable and accessible curriculum, culturally and emotionally  responsive school climate, active parental engagement, and the core belief that all students can rise to high  expectations.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 100, Isaac Clason is a PreK -5 th grade school located in the Soundview section of the Bronx. Our school currently  serves approximately 550 students with a wide-ranging set of supports and services. Our students are fortunate to  have opportunities for after-school programs, including partnerships with Community Based Organizations such as  Phipps Neighborhood, New York Junior Tennis & Learning and Inside Broadway, a kind gift of the esteemed Ruben  Diaz, via the CASA Grant. We also continue to strive for the equity and access that is afforded to the children in more  affluent districts.    Our school continues to emphasize the importance of a holistic approach towards education in which we explicitly  teach to each child’s social/emotional needs as well as academic and instructional. In this effort, our school continues  to strengthen our use of positive behavior interventions and supports and ensures that they are present in all aspects  of every child’s instructional day at our school. Additionally, in partnership with Yale University, we are continuing  with RULER, a curriculum focused on developing Emotional Intelligence within our staff and students.    As the beginning of the 2018-2019 school year gets underway, we are in a transitional time. Principal Arbolino joined  the PS 100 community effective July 1, 2018, replacing the previous principal who held the role for 11 years. In  addition, there has been a three year trend of declining performance on state exams, decreasing student enrollment,  and an increase in chronic absenteeism. Parent perception of the school has also fluctuated for the last few years. Our  district is also at the early stages of transition, with the arrival of our new Superintendent Dr. Tobia. As a result of  these new challenges and changes, it is crucial for the PS 100 community to be ready to enter a new chapter. One of  growth, achievement, and ultimately, success for our learners as a whole. Collaboration and stakeholder buy-in is  more important than ever in order to move PS 100 onward and upward.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   PS 100 has a large percentage of Students with Disabilities. As a result, students demonstrate a diverse range of  abilities within each class. Instruction is designed to support these varied needs through the use of targeted small  group instruction, conferencing, frequent progress monitoring, AIS and RTI. Our school supports students with  Individualized Educational Plans by working with our Child Study Team with the ultimate goal of providing the least  restrictive environment for students.    Recently, following the construction of a nearby shelter, we have seen an increase in the amount of students in  temporary housing. As a result, we have had to look into additional ways to support the attendance and achievement  for this high-need group.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   This year, we look forward to continuing our focus on building capacity from within by encouraging all members of  our school community to continue to self-reflect on areas of strength, areas of next steps, and areas in which they are  proud to share their own best practices. Three goals have been established as our main priorities in guiding our school  towards successfully achieving the Instructional Focus. These goals include: 1. We will use strategies to engage in  discussion and ask questions to understand what we are learning. 2. We will work with our parents, teachers, and  friends to find ways to make our writing better. 3. We will use strategies to become better problem solvers and learn  how to explain our work in math. In reference to the Framework for Great Schools, our focus includes heavy emphasis  on collaborative teachers and rigorous instruction.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         Our School made the most progress in terms of building trust with teachers. Our school learning environment survey  indicated that 92% of teachers had a favorable response to trust with the Principal. As we continue to strengthen the  work of our teacher teams in supporting School and District initiatives, we will leverage this partnership to further  build upon the strategies that can best support our diverse group of learners.    Another key area of focus based on the Framework for Great Schools is re-establishing strong family ties. Our parents  need to become empowered as advocates for the education of their children. According to our 2017-2018 school  Quality Report, we are approaching the target on the Strong-Family Community Ties dimension. Therefore, we will be  seeking all opportunities to improve in this dimension of the Framework.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 08X100   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   574   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

After year 1  of District-wide RULER implementation, coupled with the strengthening of our school-wide PBIS plan, our school has  seen reductions in level 4 and 5 occurrences. As we move into year 2 of RULER implementation, our students will  begin to develop their own capacity for labeling their emotions and managing their behaviors. This, paired with  continued teacher professional learning around emotional intelligence will lead to a more supportive and nurturing  environment. The addition of the Class Dojo tool, will increase the frequency parent communication and streamline  the PBIS system as a whole. Teachers will continue to develop their skills in restorative approaches in order to support  students who are presenting behavioral challenges. Our school currently is twice the district average of chronically  absent students, indicating a need for targeted and strategic attendance outreach and the re-introduction of  attendance initiatives and celebrations.

For the 2018-2019 school year, and in years prior, time has been built into the weekly schedule to enable teachers to  meet in grade level teams in order to plan curriculum together and share best practices. However, it has been noted  that teachers are not strategically utilizing data to inform their teaching. There is a need for teachers to use data- based inquiry protocols in order to identify student learning gaps, implement action plans, determine if the plan is  working, and revise as needed.   Also, in conjunction with our District's goals, we are identifying 4 model classrooms in which to develop best practices  around math and reading instruction. These classrooms will be used in house as intervisitation sites in order to  continue to "spread" of such best practices.

Currently, our school provides opportunities for parents to participate in Super Tuesday events which we publicize on  our monthly calendar. Our school works closely with our PTA to provide parents and students with activities to  welcome them back into the school building during non-instructional hours such as movie nights, craft fairs,  father/daughter dances, mother/son game nights, and other exciting ways to connect the home and school. We have  observed that while several events are heavily attended including the movie nights, other nights are very lightly  attended such as our curricular nights. We are attempting to increase parental involvement for our instructional  nights to match the turn out of our fun filled activity nights.    Additionally, according to the learning environment survey, parents expressed a lack in communication and feeling  welcome in the school. Therefore, we are implementing Class Dojo as a parent communication tool. We are also re- instituting assemblies to honor students of the month and perfect attendance. Parents will also be awarded for their  contributions to student success.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  As part of our hiring process, our Principal utilizes the NYC Teacher Finder to search for candidates that currently  maintain active licenses required to teach the grade level and instructional area they are being hired for. For example,  this year our school created a vacancy for a licensed physical education teacher to support the PE needs of our  students. Additional teachers were hired for our 2nd grade and 3rd grade. In this process, there were screening  interviews over the phone to identify candidates that have experiences with our curriculum, our community, or  previous teaching experience. As a next step, qualified candidates were invited in to our school to conduct demo  lessons in classrooms that are similar to the position they will be interviewing for (including self contained special  education classrooms, integrated co-teaching environments, or general education classrooms). Candidates are then  invited in for follow up discussions with members of our instructional cabinet including instructional coaches,  assistant principals, and other teachers in our school to determine if they are most qualified compared to other  applicants. Once hired, all teachers take part in ongoing and sustained professional learning including inter-visitations  with colleagues, support and modeling of instruction by instructional coaches and external consultants, as well as  observation feedback from school administration.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Our school’s Professional Learning Team has established weekly learning opportunities for all teachers to engage in  meaningful and relevant learning activities aligned to the Charlotte Danielson Framework for Effective Teaching. In  this effort, teachers work with their teams to strengthen their integration of the Common Core Learning Standards  into their instruction using all relevant instructional resources. Our professional learning team reviewed District goals  as well as our school's instructional focus to determine appropriate cycles of professional learning that should be  provided to all teachers. Our professional learning cycles include opportunities for differentiation based on the grade  level and subject area that each teacher teaches. Attention to our most vulnerable populations remains a priority and  professional development is aligned to support strategies for engaging and motivating these and all learners to take  ownership over their own learning. Professional learning opportunities include: Balanced Literacy Components,  review of data to support instructional approaches in all subject areas, professional learning to support social studies  and the new curriculum, professional learning to support the implementation of Teachers College Readers and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      Writers units of study, and other opportunities are up for consideration based on observation noticings and teacher  input.

TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).  N/A                Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  Our school’s Prekindergarten classroom is using the common core aligned curriculum displayed on the Engage NY  webpage. This curriculum is used daily by our PreK provider to ensure that students are consistently being exposed to  common core aligned learning opportunities to ensure that each child is developing a strong foundation of skills  including letter and word development skills, and numerical fluency. In this effort, our school based support team  works closely with our school psychologist and parent/guardian to identify services that need to be considered for  children at their Turning 5 meetings or in advance of this meeting if the child’s development warrants the  consideration.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Our school maintains a professional learning team. This team consists of a group of teachers who work closely with  administration to consider appropriate and necessary professional learning opportunities based on a combination of  self-assessed needs, trends or patterns of student needs, and specific observation feedback from administration. Our  school maintains a part-time instructional coach, Response to Intervention Team, School Testing Team, and ongoing  communication with our superintendent and borough field office. Our Principal meets regularly with the school's UFT  representative and members of our instructional cabinet to consider input regarding professional learning next steps.  Additionally, our school maintains a vertical team in which one representative from each grade meets regularly with  administration to consider instructional implications based on assessment data and implications based on student  work review protocols.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Tax Levy (FSF)   Local   446.065     0     12,366     0    3,622,872      X     N/A     x     N/A      X      Column B   Section Reference(s)  5A: 3c, 5c: 3a, 5e: 3a     N/A     5a: 3a     N/A     5A: 3c, 5B: 3c, 5C,:  3C, 5D: 3c, 5E: 3c          4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)     1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35        Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 100, Isaac Clason , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 100, Isaac Clason will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;   ● Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community.      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office;   ● Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● Provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● Host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● Schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● Conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help.         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● Holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● Hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● Encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● Supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● Establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● Encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● Providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● Developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● Providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand         School-Parent Compact (SPC) PS 100 Isaac Clason   School-Parent Compact (SPC)      PS 100, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards and Assessments.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39            Provide high quality curriculum and instruction consistent with State Standards to enable participating children to  meet the State’s Standards and Assessments by:   I.

ELLs are provided rigorous instruction.  Teachers use researched based  programs that support the academic growth and the development of language for ELLs.  ELL  teachers, classroom teachers, and coaches look at data to determine areas that ELL students need  additional support.  After analyzing the data from this years EDAT, and reviewing the data from  K-5 benchmark assessments, which include Fountas and Pinnell, IRLA, and the Teacher College  Narrative Post Writing results, P.S. 100 has determined the need for several after school  supplementary reading and writing programs that focus on language conventions, vocabulary  development, elaboration, craft, and structure.  In addition, newcomers will be given additional  support in phonological awareness, decoding skills, and early reading skills.  All after-school  programs are conducted in English and included relevant and meaningful scaffolds, provide  support with phonemic awareness and decoding skills, and are taught through the content  areas.  All programs provide a pretest and post-test along with periodic assessments which  deliver information on individual student progress.  First Grade After-school Program will utilize a research-based intervention RTI approach which  may include the Fountas & Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention System.  The after-school  program will run for at least 12 weeks beginning in November.  Classes will be held on  Wednesdays from 2:20pm – 4:20pm.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?   Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System for all grades K-5 are utilized to monitor early literacy skills. Our school  utilizes Teachers College Reading and Writing curriculum to teach and assess writing and reading.  The TC units of study  support the needs of ELLs with specific scaffolds and small group instruction with interventions.  This quantitative data has  shown throughout the year that our ELL students in grades K-2 are having difficulty in the area of spelling and understanding  new vocabulary inhibiting reading comprehension.   ELL students in grades 3-5 need additional support in using conventions  and features of American English, making predictions and inferences, and writing opinion pieces, supporting a point of view  with reasons.  This data is being used to adjust scaffolds being used within the classroom and to assist in developing a stronger  curriculum and provide insight into professional development that needs to take place during the school year.  Throughout the  year our staff will continue to assess what instructional strategies are being used to accelerate ELL learning and determine   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      what additional strategies need to be put into practice.            2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Our school utilizes our professional learning time to plan for teacher teams to review student work and performance data to  determine targeted interventions for our English Language Learners.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  ELL programs will be evaluated by monitoring student growth in the four modalities (Listening-Speaking-Reading- Writing).  NYSESLAT results have previously showed that students have difficulty in the area of writing and reading. As a result  Teacher Inquiry Teams at P.S. 100 will  focus on English Language Learners during a full cycle of approximately six weeks during  the 2017-2018 school year.  Small group instruction will be put in place to support ELLs in the areas of Reading, and  Writing.  The data  from these inquiry groups will be monitored.  ELL programs will be adjusted according to these results.                                      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Our school maintains an RTI team and plans for students to receive small group supplemental instruction after-school and  during morning tutorial time.  Instruction will include either Imagine Learning instruction, guided reading group instruction,  and conference groups during reading and writing workshop.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The RTI team monitors the progress of English Language Learners. Every student is given a baseline at the beginning of the  year.  If ELLs are flagged as at risk or below-benchmark on skills, they will receive targeted instructional support through RTI (  Tier 1, Tier II, and Tier III.  Teachers will use progress monitoring to show growth or need for additional support.  ELLs growth  will be evaluated against true peers to determine whether gains are being made.  The process of language acquisition needs to  be taken into account when monitoring student growth.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].     An analysis of recent NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data continues to be reviewed by our ENL teachers and members of our  Instructional Cabinet to determine areas of instructional strengths and deficiency. In previous years, the majority of English  Language learners did not make sufficient progress in writing.  Students demonstrated  difficulty with introductions and  conclusions as well as supporting reasons with evidence from the text.  Our students scored higher on the listening and  speaking sections of the NYSESLAT. It takes longer to acquire academic language used in the content areas, which effects  success in reading and writing.  ELL teacher workshops will support the staff in enhancing their knowledge on how to  accelerate ELL learning to ensure continued academic success.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51                  7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Currently, our school assesses writing in three specific genres including: narrative, argumentative, and informative.  The data is  aligned to Teachers College rubrics to identify specific areas of next steps.   Teachers are trained to incorporate conferencing  to support children in acquiring specific skills based on their next steps and also how to leverage the areas in which children  are showing strength.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.     a. English Language Learners (ELL), comprising approximately 8 percent of our school’s population.  CR Part 154  requirements for English as a New Language are met by a combination of a standalone ENL and an integrated ENL  model. Every ELL must receive a specified amount of time depending on the students proficiency level.   ELLs are  grouped according to proficiency and grade level.  No more than two continuous grades are grouped  together.  During standalone ENL students are pulled from 8:00am-8.45am for instruction.  During this time one of  three ENL teachers will work with entering and emerging levels to develop English language skills. Integrated ENL will  be provided by an ENL teacher during the ELA block in collaboration with the classroom teacher. Integrated ENL must  take place during ELA for entering, emerging, and transitioning ELLs.  At the expanding and proficient level integrated  ENL can take place through any content area that meets the students needs.  ELLs are clustered together to allow for  collaboration of ENL teachers and classroom teachers.  All ENL instruction is provided by a certified ENL teacher.  b. During stand alone sessions the ENL teachers takes the ELL students from their mainstream classroom and brings  them together for small group English instruction. Students are grouped according to proficiency level as determined  by the NYSESLAT and current grade level.    During the integrated ENL model the ENL teacher and classroom teacher  co-teach providing additional scaffolds for the English language learners.  Ell students remain with their peers and  continuity of instruction remains.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.         N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.        N/A         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Entering/Beginner ELLs are entitled to 2 units of study or 360 mins of ENL  instruction.  These students are given 180  minutes of  Stand Alone ENL and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL during ELA,  Emerging/Low Intermediate ELLs are entitled to 2  units of study of 360 mins of ENL instruction.  Emerging ELLs will receive 180 minutes of Stand Alone ENL and 180 minutes of  Integrated ENL during ELA with the flexibility of receiving 90 minutes of ENL instruction during Content Area  instruction.  Transitioning/ Intermediate ELLs are entitled to 1 unit of study or 180 minutes of ENL instruction.  Transitioning  ELLs will receive 180 minutes of Integrated ENL during ELA with the flexibility of receiving 90 minutes of ENL instruction during   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      Content Area instruction.  Expanding/Advanced ELLs are entitled to 1 unit of study or 180 minutes of ENL  instruction.  Expanding ELLs will receive 180 minutes of Integrated ENL during ELA or Content Area instruction.  Commanding  ELLs are entitled to .5 unit of study or 90 minutes per week of Integrate ENL.  Commanding ELLs will receive Integrated ENL  instruction during ELA or during Content Area instruction. Only certified ENL teachers provided mandated units/minutes of  ENL instruction.  Administration monitors all ELL providers schedules to ensure mandated minutes for ELL students are  achieved.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Although the language of instruction at P.S. 100 is English, we understand the complexities of learning a new language. In  grades K- 5 teachers use the following strategies to help support language acquisition.  Teachers use oral language activities, to  help support speaking and listening, they group students who are new with native speakers and proficient English speakers to  help build confidence and gain access to language through group work.  Teachers model activities and provide samples of  student work in order to provide clear examples.  Teacher also use non-verbal cues when they can to reinforce a lesson.  These  could be in the form of real objects, gestures, or pictures.  Also, home language resources are provided across all  grades.   Teachers access home language resources to support classroom instruction.  Resources are available  through the  NYC MYlibrary program, technology,  the schools library, and the teacher resource room.           4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?       Students have access to bilingual content-area glossaries, picture dictionaries, and bilingual dictionaries. Students who speak  the ELL student's native language are partnered up to encourage translation for clarification. Beginner ELLs are the opportunity  to write in their native language in order to express their ideas.  Translation is done when possible.   Math and Science test are  available in the students home language during state testing.              5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       Students with Interrupted Formal Education:   At this time we do not have SIFE student.s at P.S. 100.  We do have structures  in place to identify SIFE students. We identify SIFE students by reviewing their transcripts, family interviews, and completion of  the HLIS. We will provide SIFE students with additional support and instruction. ENL and classroom teachers will provide  intensive literacy and content instruction to activate prior knowledge, provide a print rich environment, engage students in  hands on learning, provide multiple experiences with vocabulary, have students work in cooperative groups, and provide  systematic phonic instruction. SIFE students will also have the opportunity to attend an ELL morning enrichment program and  after school programs which will enhance their learning experience. The school’s guidance counselor will be available to  provide counseling services for all SIFE students.   Newcomers:   ELL students with less than three years of service will receive a combination of a standalone ENL  and  integrated ENL. ENL teachers will work closely with the classroom teacher to support academic content area instruction  through focused lessons using instructional strategies to accelerate ELL learning.  ELL testing accomidations are provided for  state and local testing.     ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years:    Students receiving four to six years of ESL instruction will continue to take part in a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      combination of standalone ENL and Integrated ENL.  Students will receive additional instruction and targeted interventions  aligned with the  Common Core standads.   ELL students will participate in Buddy reading to increase fluency.   RTI and  Standalone ENL will provide select students with additional support through the use of  “ Leveled Literacy Intervention  Program ”  by Fountas and Pinnell,  “ Measuring Up ”  by Peoples Education,  "Reading Comprehension Strategies" by  Sundance and Fundations/Wilson Reading programs. These programs are researched based interventions put in place to help  students who are below grade level in reading. They use authentic literature, graphic organizers, and scaffold support to  accelerate students' reading growth.    In addition to these programs PS 100 has implemented  “ Imagine Learning English  ”  during the ELL morning enrichment program 4 days a week to support lower performing ELL students in school through the  use of technology. Imagine Learning English provides differentiated instruction based on assessment results and adapts  instruction to meet students’ needs.   ELL students will also be given the opportunity to attend after school programs  throughout the school year focusing on ELA and Math.      Long Term ELLs. P.S. 100 will address the needs of long term ELLs with focused instruction and extra support through RTI, ELL  morning enrichment program, and after school programs.  ELL-SWD:   ELLs identified as having special needs will receive mandated services as indicated on their IEP. IEP goals, and  formal and informal assessment will determine focus of individualized instruction. The use of picture dictionaries, newspapers,  magazines and content area related films are used to excel English language development. Supplemental services such as after  school, and Imagine Learning will be offered to support language acquisition.     Former ELLs:  Students who have exited from ELL status will receive 90 minutes per week of ENL support for an additional two  years after passing.  Integrated ENL support will be received during ELA or content area instruction.  Students will be  monitored for continued progress and RTI will be put in place if additional support is needed.  ELL testing accomodations will  continue for two years after exiting ELL status.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?     Native language supports are provided through native language materials in the library, materials ordered through NYC My  Library program, and through the pairing of ELLs with students who speak the same native language. In the fourth grade  Integrated Co Teaching classes, a classroom teacher who speaks Spanish provides native language support to our Spanish  speaking ELL-SWDs.  Imagine Learning English Software Program is offered during an ELL morning enrichment program.  This  program reinforces skills taught in the classroom. (phonemic awareness, letter recognition, phonic, vocabulary, reading  fluency, listening, and comprehension skills) Every student is assessed and instructed at their individual levels. Native language  support is provided.  In addition, ELLs are supported with a strong mix of resources, which include: Internet resources, and an  ESL library, which includes an assortment of culturally diverse books and books on tape.     Teachers of ELL's use visuals and films to scaffold and contextualize the cognitively demanding language of content area  subjects.  Content area word walls with words and pictures along with Fundations in lower grades help ELL's to be more successful in the  target language.           7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?     The school highlights ELL strategies within the ELA and Math curriculum to support English acquisition.  Teachers implement  through instructional planning.  Teachers meet  to discuss student progress and discuss ways to modify instruction to meet the  needs of their ELL students.  ELLS-SWDs performance and instructional needs are monitored by the classroom teachers, ENL  teachers and the IEP team.  Schedules are looked at closely by the IEP team and administration  to ensure students participate  and receive support during core curriculum in the least restrictive environment.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54       The school's RTI team monitors ELL state assessments, baselines, and benchmark assessments, and sends out informal  questionnaires to grade level teachers in order to track the growth  ELLs. If a student is falling behind, the following supports  will be put in place: ESL classroom and teacher support will be added through the use of additional ESL materials and  strategies, ELL morning program, after-school programs, and RTI will be implemented according to need.  Imagine Learning  English is utilized during an ELL morning intervention  program from 7 :30am - 8:00am , Monday through Thursday.  After  school programs will be extended to those students needing additional support.  After school programs include Peoples  Education & I-Ready Technology Intervention program.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       Students who need additional support will have the opportunity to attend after-school supplemental instruction classes.  We  will monitor the effectiveness of the program by reviewing writing performance data of our students and looking at summative  data based on end of year assessments.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   All ELL students are afforded equal access to school programs at P.S. 100.  After school programs are offered for ELA and Math  to help prepare for the New York State tests.  Students are invited to try out for chorus and encourage to run for student  government and participate in class plays for parent and school performances.  They are also given the opportunity to attend  NY Junior Tennis and Learning and Phipps After-School Program.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   Imagine Learning English a computer based program enables teachers to support their  ELL students with differentiated  instruction through a one-on- one instructor giving native language support, relevant and meaningful scaffolds, academic  vocabulary and content area reading, all of which is vital to our ELL population. Along with a pretest and post-test the program  includes periodic assessments and teacher reports which include up to the minute information on individual student progress.  Classroom teachers and ENL teachers can use the reports to monitor progress.  Rigby’s, On Our Way to English, is used to reinforce the Commmon Core curriculum. The program focuses on language, literacy  and content area instruction. The units are thematic and include newcomer books, big books, and manipulative charts for  guided instruction in English. The program includes both informal and formal assessments to help guide instruction.Hampton  Brown, Into English, is a support which focuses on language and literacy through content area instruction.  Along with these  programs, ELLs are supported with a strong mix of resources, which include: NOVEL databases, books from NYC My Library to  support Units of study, glossaries, dictionaries, Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT, and an ENL library, which includes an  assortment of culturally diverse books and books on tape. Teachers of ELL's use visuals and films to scaffold and contextualize  the cognitively demanding language of content area subjects. Content area word walls with words and pictures along with  realia will help ELL's to be more successful in the target language.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?                ELL students are provided with access to native language supports in a variety of ways.  Through the use of cognates,  bilingual  content-area glossaries, English and native language dictionaries, native language libraries, NOVEL databases with  language translation, native language materials ordered through the NYC My Library program, and Imagine Learning English  technology program.  Students and teachers are encourage to engage new students in their native language in order to make  content more accessible and reinforce the curriculum.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.      The required services and resources are all on grade appropriate level.  Scaffolds are used to support and expand grade level  instruction.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55                     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     Imagine Learning English a computer based program enables teachers to support their  ELL students with differentiated  instruction through a one-on- one instructor giving native language support, relevant and meaningful scaffolds, academic  vocabulary and content area reading, all of which is vital to our ELL population.

Content area word walls with words and pictures along with  realia will help ELL's to be more successful in the target language.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    P.S. 100 does not offer activities to newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school year.  Students and parents  are given access to translated materials  such as the P.S. 100 school handbook and the student is given access to all programs  available throughout our school.  Students are always partnered up with a student on his/her grade level.   Parents are invited  in for many workshops on our Super Tuesday events including academic worskhops to support parents in deepening their  understanding of our curriculum.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    No language electives are offered.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?                  Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)

Students' cumulative folders are forwarded to their new middle school.  Parent surveys and the original HLIS are included to  show program preferences.  Classroom teachers discuss specific needs of the students to ensure a smooth transition.      ELL teachers and other teachers will meet during inquiry time on Tuesday afternoons to review student work and plan for  implications for instruction.   Professional learning sessions will be planned across all grade levels on the instructional  strategies to accelerate ELL Learning. 1. Vocabulary Building 2.  Scaffolding  3. Student Engagement  4.  Student  Assessment  These instructional strategies are designed to develop the instructional skills of teachers of ELLS.   Additional  Lunch and Learns will be provided in the areas of MyLibrary and NYC Databases.  These additional workshops will help teachers  access ELL resources including native language resources.     Teacher teams will conduct a cycle of inquiry on ELLS in order to strengthen their understanding of student needs and identify  strategies and interventions to maximize student progress.       Our ELL teachers turn-key workshops and provide professional development in second language learning, the strategies for  scaffolding and learning, and how to support ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards. Teachers are given  assistance in methodology and approaches for ELL students in the classroom.  Staff development takes place throughout the  year during Monday PD meetings, and full PD days. Teachers are provided with resources to read and view from the Office of  English Language Learners. Teachers maintain their own record keeping regarding their training.  Copies of agendas, handouts,  and sign-in sheets for all ELL workshops are kept in professional development binder.  A record of mandated hours of ELL  training is kept on file.  Office staff will attend workshops on maintaining records of English Language Learners. (HLIS, OTELE,  Parents Preferred Language)        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In addition to the mandated parent orientation meeting and parent-teacher conferences, ELL teachers will meet with parents  of ELLs individually a minimum of one time a year to discuss the progress of their child's language development.  During the  meeting the parent will be informed of assessment results which include the Fall and Spring Ell periodic assessment, ELA  baseline and benchmark MOSLs and math baseline and benchmark results.   Parents will review their child's program goals and  the materials and strategies that are put in place to support their child's language acquisition.  These meetings will occur on  Tuesday afternoons between 2:20pm and 3:00pm.  The classroom/homeroom teacher will attend these meeting to aide in the  understanding of their child's progress and needs.  An interpreter will be available to assist in the language the parent or  guardian best understands.  All meetings will include a sign-in sheet which will be kept on file.            2.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Chad Adam Altman, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 100                                                                              School DBN: 08x100  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Our Instructional Cabinet will review Home Language Identification Survey data to determine which parents speak  a language other than English at home which will be used to send home translated notes home. In our school, the  majority of parents prefer to speak either English or Spanish with the exception of approximately 5 families.  Emergency contact cards are completed by parents and on this card they can indicate a preferred language.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    English   Spanish   Arabic   Twi   Sonnike   French           587   145   1   2    3   1   79.43   19.62   .14   .27   .41   .14   587   145   1   2   3   1   79.43   19.62   .14   .27   .41   .14   3.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      Our relationship with our PTA is strong, and many members of our PTA executive board are bilingual and support  communication in the event of an emergency. Our Parent coordinator, AP's, and school secretary are also bilingual in  Spanish and English. Our PTA executive board members will be consulted to determine if other languages are  represented in our PTA that may be on call to support translation if a parent feels comfortable with a parent  translating for a parent. The translation/interpretation department will also be utilized.    For parents who speak languages other than English or Spanish, we will utilize Google Translate to quickly and  efficiently convert essential emergency phrases into the necessary language.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.
