The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that  meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school  can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to  provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including  all stakeholders.     The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program:     A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff,   community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity.  We must all be willing learners.     A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence.    Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school   community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal     Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school   environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members.     Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work.    The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over   the three year period of renewal.     The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy:   By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align  instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.   Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction,  school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school  culture.     The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy:  In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase  student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve  teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and  increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of  student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning  and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal  schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring  of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a  Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and  expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will  stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school  ready and able to learn.    Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP)   The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for  each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great  Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools,  Strong Communities, including the following:     Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19   RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          5      the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All  Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping  benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the  Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by  definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership  demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.      Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and   documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the  desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.      Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes   and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five  discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an  action plan.     Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental   health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school.     Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool      and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners.  Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and  instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding  to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students.    Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement.      Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          6      The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive  Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for  continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing  review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement  activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students.       Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.       The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          7     how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:   1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity  2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions  3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support  4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions  5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and  6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for RSCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Renewal school   and meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs   assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative  data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          8        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.       Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools.     Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs   assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific,  Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor  progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school  community know when you have reached your goal.       Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement   Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections.     Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Section 3: Community Engagement Team and School Leadership Team (SLT) Signature Page       Directions: All SLT members are expected to sign this page to confirm their participation in the development of this  Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP).

Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year.   The Long Island City High School (LICHS) community is eagerly preparing for the 2018-2019 school year. Our Cohort T  students’ achievement of a 75.6% graduation rate as of August 2018, demonstrating a significant increase from the  prior school year and our scores of 7 Well Developed ratings and 3 Proficient ratings on the NYC Quality Review in  2018 poise us to move student achievement significantly forward. In collaboration with our community school partner  Zone 126, our Queens North High School Superintendent, our Queens North Field Support staff and Director of School  Renewal we will be able to achieve our goals for improving student outcomes for this year and beyond. The LICHS  school community shares a rigorous vision for increasing our students’ levels of cognitive engagements, as indicated  in the 5 RSCEP goals for improved student achievement and well-being at LICHS.   LICHS has made progress in each of the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools. The most significant growth  is evident in the elements of Collaborative Teachers, Effective School Leadership, Supportive Environment, and Trust  as indicated by the corresponding findings of the last three Quality Reviews with multiple indicators determined to be  Well Developed, culminating in 7 of the indicators being found to be Well Developed in 2018. The 2017-2018 Quality  Review reviewer described an area of celebration: "A system of accountability for high expectations is established. It  supports teachers in improving their practice and students as they prepare for the next level of their college and  career readiness". Strong Family-Community Ties has shown growth from prior School Surveys and the School Quality  Snapshots. However, data also indicates that we, as a Community High School, can still do better and that this is still  an area of high priority.    Long Island City High School is committed to the development of a safe and productive learning community that  fosters a meaningful and respectful communication among students, staff, parents/guardians and the community in  order to achieve common goals. With a strong focus on promoting literacy and communication skills across the  curriculum, instruction will be delivered through smaller learning communities. Our curriculum is shaped by the  consistent collection and analysis of data, rituals and routines, active engagement, and opportunities to apply new  knowledge supporting a culture of responsibility, citizenship and self-directed instruction.    Long Island City High School is proud to provide a resoundingly high level educational experience to all students. As a  school with a successful history in preparing youngsters for achievement in the 21st century, LICHS ensures that all its  students take the courses which challenge their minds to the utmost. In addition to encouraging four years of study in  math, science, and world languages, we encourage active study of art, music, culinary arts, and technology.  Consequently, students supplement the traditional academics and athletics with a healthy balance of aesthetic  activities.     This shared vision of LICHS expresses our commitment to the development of a safe and productive learning  environment that fosters a meaningful and respectful collaboration among students, staff, parents/guardians, and the  community in order to achieve common goals. With a strong focus on promoting literacy and communication skills  across the curriculum, instruction is delivered through smaller learning communities. Our curriculum is shaped by the   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          12      consistent collection and analysis of data, rituals and routines, active engagement, and opportunities to apply new  knowledge supporting a culture of responsibility, citizenship, and self-directed, lifelong learning.     Our LICHS Core Values, proudly displayed throughout the school, are what guide instruction, collaboration,  programming, supports, family and community building:     • Dedication to academic achievement through hard work, persistence and collaboration.  • Celebrate the diversity among our LICHS family and promote a safe environment with respect for all.  • Be responsible! Think first, make good choices and strive to become the leaders of tomorrow.  • The future is not some place we are going to, but one we are creating.     The Missions of our Smaller Learning Communities (SLC) provide a thematic focus for all of our programs. They are:     • Academy of Humanities and Urban Culture (HUC): The Academy of Humanities and Urban Culture helps students  turn passions into careers. By making connections across the disciplines through humanities, culture, and the arts, our  students become well-rounded individuals who have the skills to serve their community today and in the future. A  partnership among educators, students, and their families, HUC allows students to discover who they are and who  they hope to become as they prepare for college, careers, and a lifetime of learning.     • Academy of Wellness Education (AWE): We are the future health professionals and athletes of Long Island City High  School. As members of the Academy of Wellness Education, we strive to positively contribute to the Long Island City  High School community through propriety, ethical decency, and diligence. We understand the importance of personal  responsibility and hard work in accomplishing our goals for the future. We cannot change the actions of others, but  always do our best to promote academic achievement by demonstrating the behavior and work ethic necessary to  ensure a fulfilling future. If we set an example for our peers as independent thinkers who are committed to our own  health, and are consistent with our ambitions and persistent in our goals we will attain academic and personal  success.     • Culinary and Restaurant Hospitality Management Academy (CUL): The students in the Culinary Arts Academy and  Restaurant Hospitality Management small learning community will learn and develop skills that they will be able to  apply to future careers in their everyday lives in the Long Island City High School Community. The 21st Century skills  learned as part our Academy promotes and enhances college and career readiness that is supported across the  curriculum. In our smaller learning communities, we stress respect and achievement. We apply all of the core subjects  and technical subjects to enhance individual strengths in all areas that will embrace lifelong learning.   • Global Languages Academy (LANG): Our goal is to equip student with the skills they need to be successful learners  and to be ready for the challenges of today’s globalized society. The Global Languages Academy believes that  languages and technological skills will open a world of possibilities to our students. The creation of the Global  Informatics program has been made possible through our collaboration with High Schools That Work (HSTW) and the  NYCDOE Office of Post-Secondary Readiness (OPSR). We will prepare students to compete in a global economy by  focusing on languages, technology, and communication skills that will ensure their success in secondary education  and careers. The Global Languages Academy provides supports and opportunities for students interested in  international business, travel and in careers in tourism and hospitality. SY 2018-19 is the fourth year of our Dual  Language program in Spanish with a strong STEM pathway for students to become bi-lingual, bi-literate, and bi- cultural culminating with the seal of Bi-Literacy on their Diplomas from NYSED. This academy’s Global Informatics  program is proceeding with a full 150 9th grade cohort down the road to CTE certification.    2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          13      Zone 126, our lead Community Based Organization (CBO) partner, provides support, outlines the partnership with  other CBOs and ensures that all stakeholders work together to coordinate services, eliminating gaps and overlaps and  communicate effectively with the whole school community.     Long Island City High School’s three-session instructional program focuses on providing all students an ELT program  concentrating on Academics, Global and World Language proficient citizens and Aesthetics. By programming all  students for a minimum of nine periods, we provide all students daily instruction in sequenced studies; college and  career focused courses and/or advanced studies in STEM beyond the NYSED requirements in a variety of elective  subjects: for credit, or as one of our AIS co-curricular programmatic supports for students who have struggled  academically. Long Island City provides in our multi-session school for the creation of sequences of study in CTE,  Visual Arts, Music, Technology, JROTC and World Languages that integrate this Extended Learning Time into our  instructional day. Our targeted multi-faceted plan incorporates social, emotional, academic, and nutritional elements  to support improved student achievement. Each component of this second ELT block is designed to target the specific  academic or enrichment needs of all students at Long Island City High School.   Participation in academic and enrichment clubs enables our children to excel in areas of personal interest while each  program addresses the enhancement of literacy as well as other Common Core aligned skills. 9th grade double period  ELA and Mathematics, our Pre-AP 9th grade initiative in ELA, Algebra 1 and Biology, student Internships and Peer  Tutoring, (i.e. Advanced Placement, Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID)’s Determination Club etc.)  focus on Common Core aligned literacy skills individualized through the use of a skills based needs assessment. The  use of technology is an integral part of these programs. Timely feedback is provided to students and parents regarding  student progress using SKEDULA, our Bulldog Blue monthly student progress reports and other communication tools.     These elements of our ELT program are supported by English, ESL, Math, Science, Social Studies licensed teachers,  Guidance Counselors, Social Workers, School Administrators, Cafeteria workers, Custodians, partners such as Let’s Get  Ready, ENACT, St John’s GEARUP and Community Work Project from Zone 126 just to name several.     The afterschool Community Schools’ Initiatives in collaboration with Zone 126ELT program incorporating community  partners will be a critical support for our Community School’s initiative in our planning. Our Community School  Leadership Team has reviewed all supports, asking that they be cohesive and not duplicative. After school clubs  promote social emotional growth. Academic clubs focus on student achievement, proficiency and mastery scores on  the Regents examinations.   The 2018-2019 ELT Program at Long Island City High School with more than one hour of total Extended Learning Time  for each student is built on the successful elements of our prior years’ ELT programs. These programs continue to  engage our students in Community Schools’ Initiatives in collaboration with Zone 126 after school clubs with regularly  scheduled sessions as well as additional post-secondary courses such as Advanced Placement Courses, College Now,  AIS courses and 4th year mathematics and science electives.            2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          14         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 30Q450   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   2256   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   # Special Classes (ELA)  # Special Classes (Math)   # Visual Arts  # Foreign Language   % Title I Population  % Free Lunch  % Limited English Proficient   68  64   39  90   % American Indian or Alaska Native  % Hispanic or Latino  % White   # SETSS (ELA)  # SETSS (Math)  Types and Number of Special Classes (2018-19)  # Music  # Drama  # CTE  # Dance   75  21   42     # Integrated Collaborative Teaching (ELA)  # Integrated Collaborative Teaching (Math)   School Composition (2017-18)   78.0%  % Attendance Rate  74.6%  % Reduced Lunch  11.7%  % Students with Disabilities   Racial/Ethnic Origin (2017-18)   % Black or African American   0.7%  65.8%  % Asian or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander  6.5%   % Multi-Racial   Personnel (2015-16)   Years Principal Assigned to School (2018-19)  % of Teachers with No Valid Teaching Certificate  % Teaching with Fewer Than 3 Years of Experience   6.25  2%  9%   # of Assistant Principals (2016-17)  % Teaching Out of Certification  Average Teacher Absences (2014-15)   Student Performance for Elementary and Middle Schools (2017-18)   ELA Performance at levels 3 & 4   Science Performance at levels 3 & 4 (4th Grade) (2016-17)   N/A   N/A   Mathematics Performance at levels 3 & 4  Science Performance at levels 3 & 4 (8th Grade) (2016- 17)   Student Performance for High Schools (2016-17)   ELA Performance at levels 3 & 4  Global History Performance at levels 3 & 4  4 Year Graduation Rate   Regents Diploma w/ Advanced Designation   76%  69%  60.7%   10.6%   Mathematics Performance at levels 3 & 4  US History Performance at Levels 3 & 4  6 Year Graduation Rate (2011 Cohort)  % ELA/Math Aspirational Performance Measures  (2015-16)   Reward  In Good Standing  Focus District   Priority School   Overall NYSED Accountability Status (2018-19)   No  No  Yes   Recognition  Local Assistance Plan  Focus School Identified by a Focus District   No   Focus Subgroups   -

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   Long Island City High School has made significant growth in the area of Rigorous Instruction since the last Integrated  Intervention Team (IIT). The IIT Recommendation: “School leaders should implement research-based protocols across all  school learning communities, departments, and grades, for conducting frequent formative assessment and explicitly  using the protocol” has resulted in the implementation of our “Noticings & Wonderings” protocol where each week, the  Assistant Principals as well as other staff members conduct focused walk-throughs with “ Noticings” statements that are  generated. During SLC and Departmental team collaborations, the “Noticings” are reviewed and “Wonderings” are  generated along with “Next Steps.” This constructivist and transparent tool has enabled the LICHS school community to  show impact on teacher practices that result in increased levels of academic cognitive engagement in their lessons, as  well as progress in curriculum alignment to the Common Core across all disciplines. The use of "Noticings &  Wonderings" has been noted in several school reviews over the past two years, in particular in our most recent 2018  NYC Quality Review as a best practice positively impacting instruction.       The 2017-2018 NYC School Quality Review School noted:" School leaders communicate the belief that all students  should have access to Advanced Placement and other college and career preparatory courses. Reflecting that belief, the  school is organized so that all students, including students with disabilities, have access to Advanced Placement (AP)  courses, college preparatory courses, and career readiness skill development. For example, one of the four AP United  States History classes is designed as an ICT model, open to general education students and students with disabilities.  This school year we have an ICT model class in AP English Language as well, open to general education and students with  disabilities. The school’s expectations for college and career preparation for all students is also clearly delineated   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          17      through a “College Summit App Map” that is available to students and lays out the milestones they have to achieve each  year in high school and college, to be successful." As a result, a data analysis indicated that while the school register has  been decreasing over the past 5 years, student access to Advanced Placement courses, College Now, as well as recently  created upper level rigorous courses that are included in the College and Career Readiness Index has remained at  approximately 27% of the students enrolled in Advanced Placement course with a significant number of those student  taking 2 to 3 AP courses. In addition, College Now enrollment has expanded, both in the registration of higher numbers  of students to existing College Now classes, but also the expansion of additional offerings to provide students the power  of choice as a post-secondary option. As a result, the Annual Goal was developed through the collaboration of the  Cabinet, the Instructional Cabinet with representatives of academic and non-academic department, Smaller Learning  Community teams, the School Leadership Team, and the Community Based Organization to address improving college  and career readiness.            Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction   What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across  classrooms?    LONG ISLAND CITY HIGH SCHOOL -INSTRUCTIONAL FOCUS 2018-2019]   When core tasks in all subject areas are aligned to Writing Is Thinking (WIT Hochman) strategies such as annotation and  note-taking to think about vocabulary and key ideas linked to that task, all students are challenged to complete  cognitively engaging academic tasks at a higher level. Moreover, when teachers focus on the annotation skills and note- taking needed to make sense of a task, chart, or reading passage, all students are able to access and comprehend Tier II  and Tier III vocabulary, determine importance, understand main ideas and use supporting details. Furthermore, this  comprehension allows students to own their learning and justify their thinking through increasingly complex written  and oral responses. Finally, when students receive daily actionable feedback from teachers and peers around these  responses, it will result in improvement in their skills, content knowledge and ability to make connections.   Through continuous professional development activities including peer inter-visitations, and observation feedback,  teachers will hone the skills needed to improve student achievement. Inter-visitation on a regular basis will build  department coherence around the instructional focus and on the implementation of daily student feedback, sharing of  teacher practices for task design and student work product. Teacher professional development will focus on vocabulary  strategies, literacy task design strategies, text supports and gradual removal of scaffolds. Teacher observations will  focus on the planning and use of literacy tasks, checks for understanding, questioning , discussion and assessment.  Student engagement will result in structured initial writing product. WITsi tasks will be used to evaluate student content  acquisition. Formal assessments will focus on the students’ use of writing scaffolds and student writing product.          What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners,  personally, academically, and culturally?   All staff is engaged in collaborative development of CCLS-aligned curricula. By focusing on curricula alignment to CCLS,  literacy across all content areas, our instructional focus, and teacher collaboration all students will be engaged in  learning skills that will enable them to succeed. Curricular materials are selected as tools to implement the CCLS and  CTE, industry and NYS Learning Standards, and many instructional and assessment tasks are planned to be rigorous,  engaging, and interdisciplinary. Lesson plans explicitly include targeted strategies for the students, or groups of  students, based on ongoing analysis of formative assessments. Queens North Field Support Center (QNFSC) coaches,   DSR and other onsite PD supports train and support teachers to use protocols to develop targeted intervention  strategies, ICT and other Universal Design for Learning (UDL) models for instruction and to better understand CCLS  shifts. QNFSC coaches provide professional development to enable teachers to meet the needs of our diverse student   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          18      population, embrace cultural identity and foster community among our students through the units and lessons they  create.         What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be  career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision?  The four theme based Smaller Learning Communities (SLCs) enable our students to pursue their post secondary interest  within their high school experience. Beginning with the high school application process and the articulation of students  prior to their entry into the 9th grade students choose their SLC from among the following Academies: Humanities &  Urban Culture (HUC), Academy of Wellness Education (AWE), Global Languages (LANG), Culinary Arts (CUL). In their  Academy, students develop skills that prepare them for their post-secondary experiences. The non-negotiable of each  student and staff member affiliation to an SLC structure is designed to address the needs of the individualized student  and the needs of the staff to support every student as envisioned in the Instructional Shifts. Staff is provided customized  professional development by their Peer Collaborative Teacher, SLC AP Director or Behavioral Support Teachers twice  weekly through the use of the Datawise model as an SLC team, in addition to school wide professional development to  support this endeavor, either through a focus on Academic Inquiry or Behavioral Support Inquiry.         What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?   With the support of school leaders, the implementation of a school wide annotation and note-taking common series of  vocabulary strategies, together with the implementation of the school wide writing rubric, comprehension of Tier II and  Tier III vocabulary through carefully crafted language and content objectives, and all teachers’ focus on writing to a  performance task with rigor promotes students being actively engaged on a daily basis. Students receive daily  actionable feedback from teachers and peers resulting in an improvement in their skills and content knowledge.         How do you envision teachers using multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child?  Teachers are provided professional development on the school wide ICT professional development, literacy and social  emotional learning through weekly professional development and other initiatives. DOE and NYSED curricular initiatives  such as shifts in the Global curricula and individualized student's needs. The Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) model is  systemic and teachers are prioritized common planning time three times and week and also work in teams to ensure  that multiple entry points are incorporated into lessons, tasks, and student products. The movement of both PD and  supervision of ICT and content teachers to departmental APs makes the ICT initiative seamless with the curricular  initiatives.          What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and  summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes?  All pedagogical staff are involved in cycles of focused instructional walk-throughs using the "Noticings and Wonderings"  protocol.

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?      The element of supportive environment has been an area of celebration on Quality Reviews since the current leadership  and themed 9-12 grade SLC structures have been in place. Reviewers’ remarks include that staff members consistently  communicate high expectations to all students and provide guidance supports for students to achieve the expectations.  It was noted that school leaders convey high expectations to all staff and support them in creating shared accountability  and success in attaining the expectations.   A common goal of all is that students have ownership of their educational experiences and are well prepared for their  next level. All staff members hold themselves mutually accountable for their professional growth and for all students’  success in meeting the school’s high expectations for learning by all.   Evidence showed that school leaders communicate the belief that all students should have access to Advanced  Placement and other college and career preparatory courses. Reflecting that belief, the school is organized so that all  students, including students with disabilities, have access to Advanced Placement (AP) courses, college preparatory  courses, and career readiness skill development. For example, one of the four AP World, United States History and  English Language AP classes are designed as an ICT model, open to general education students and students with  disabilities. The school’s expectations for college and career preparation for all students is also clearly delineated  through a “College Summit App Map” that is available to students and lays out the milestones they have to achieve each  year in high school and college, to be successful.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 4: Teacher Practices  and Decisions)    Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice  Tenet 4 Statement of Practice  Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the  appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.  4.2  School and teacher leaders ensure that instructional practices and strategies are organized   around annual, unit, and daily lesson plans that address all student goals and needs.   4.3  Teachers provide coherent, and appropriately aligned Common Core Learning Standards   (CCLS)-based instruction that leads to multiple points of access for all students.   4.4  Teachers and students work together to implement a program/plan to create a learning   environment that is responsive to students’ varied experiences and tailored to the strengths  and needs of all students.   4.5  Teachers inform planning and foster student participation in their own learning process by   using a variety of summative and formative data sources (e.g., screening, interim measures,  and progress monitoring).

Identify the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section.   3.  4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   According to the feedback from the NYC Quality Review conducted March 2018, LICHS was found to be Well Developed  in 7 elements, in particular the element of Collaborative Teachers. The findings indicated: Teacher teams strategically  analyze teaching practices and writing samples for a focus group of students whom they share, to identify gaps in  achievement. Teacher team work is directly aligned to the school’s instructional focus and promotes the  implementation of CCLS. Teacher collaborations across the school result in school-wide coherence around the writing  strategies identified in the teacher inquiry teams, and improvements in teacher practice that lead to student mastery of  specific goals. For coherence across teacher teams, the staff uses the “Noticings and Wonderings” protocol, while  looking at student work to identify student needs. Teachers learn strategies from team members and collaborate to  brainstorm ideas that address the targeted students’ needs.        Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers   What is your vision for collaborative teaching?     Our current SLC structure incorporates the 9 th grade into each of the theme based SLCs, requiring students and families  to exercise the power of choice upon entry into the school. This has allowed LICHS to anticipate affiliation of staff to  specific SLCs as part of the teacher preference process in the spring of the previous year, maximizing planning and  preparation for SLC themed teacher team work. Therefore, evidence shows that as a result teacher teams are better  able to meet the needs of all students in the SLC. Teacher Teams who collaborate during Academic, Behavioral and  Common Planning Time, as members of Inquiry Teams, in Departmental Teams, and as members of School Leadership  are able to address the needs of the student from entering LICHS to graduation.    2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          32      Teaching and learning is a priority component of every teams’ work. Teachers collaborate to improve their skills based  on students’ academic, social and emotional needs. Tasks and student work are collaboratively reviewed regularly  throughout the year in teams using the Datawise method of inquiry and the aligned lessons are designed as the Units  are implemented during the year incorporating collaboratively designed strategies. These include WIT (Hochman  Writing) and our Tier II and Tier III vocabulary Initiative. As our teachers participate in professional development and  learn new strategies and techniques, they apply what they have learned to their discipline and their students’ needs.    The SLC structure allows teachers to ensure that every child is known well by the team of teachers, each of whom  teaches them in their class. The teacher also collaborates with the support staff of the SLC, including the Peer  Collaborative Teacher, the guidance counselor, the Behavioral Support Teacher, the Attendance Teacher and the SLC  Director as well as their colleagues who also teach the child. Case conferencing occurs regularly, where the SLC team  shares important information about the students and co-construct interventions, if necessary.    During the SLC meetings data analysis takes many forms and is ongoing. Individual student data is analyzed during  Inquiry; attendance data is reviewed twice weekly in Behavioral Inquiry Teams by SLC; Marking Period data for the SLC  as well as school-wide data is reviewed by the team as soon as it becomes available and Monthly Bulldog Blue Progress  Reports are provided by SLC each month for inquiry; departmental data with respect to scholarship, Regents’ results,  uniform midterms and finals’ data is discussed during Departmental PD meetings.    Each SLC has expressed concerns that improving student performance on the New Global History Regents is a high  priority need, as only 65.7% of students who took the Transitional Global examination in June 2018 passed, with a  significant number of students absenting themselves from this examination. These variables led to the conclusion  around the need to work together to improve outcomes for all students, but especially for 10th graders sitting for the  New Global Regents and the 11th graders retesting or testing for the first time with the Transitional Global Regents  examination as an essential part of their Hochman Writing Strategy inquiry work.            How do you envision collaboration amongst your School Instructional Cabinet to improve teacher practices and  student learning?  The Instructional Cabinet will add regular participation by PCTs to weekly meetings. Also Assistant Principal Critical  Friends Groups (CFGs) will focus on a problem of teacher practices and student learning through deepening their inquiry  work with the support of staff from HSTW and the QNFSC.          How do you envision collaboration within teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?   Teacher teams strategically analyze teaching practices and writing samples for a focus group of students whom they  share, to identify gaps in achievement and actionable next steps. Teacher team work is directly aligned to the school’s  instructional focus and promotes the implementation of CCLS.          How do you envision collaboration across teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?   Teacher collaborations across the school result in school-wide coherence around the writing strategies identified in the  teacher inquiry teams, and improvements in teacher practice that lead to student mastery of specific skills, content and  thereby goals. During weekly Instructional Cabinet meetings team members including the Principal, APs, PCTs, the CBO  representative and other constituencies share data, findings, needs, and PD to facilitate communication, collaboration,  improve teacher practice, improve parent involvement and improve student outcomes.      What data will teachers and the School Instructional Cabinet regularly review to ensure that they are reflecting upon  their teaching practices and meeting individual student learning needs?  What is the intent for reviewing each piece of  data? (ex. Teachers will regularly review student IEPs when developing lessons in order to ensure that tasks are  appropriately scaffolded.)   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          33      Data Reviewed   Marking period STARS  reports   Review progress toward credit accumulation.

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   From the most recent IIT to the present, LICHS has ensured that the school community shares SMART goals, our mission,  long-term vision, and core values that address the priorities outlined earlier in this RSCEP. The NYC Quality Reviews of  April 2016 and March 2018 Quality Reviews (QRs) have demonstrated growth with respect to this Statement Of Practice  (SOP), as evidenced by the increase in the number of indicators that have risen to Well Developed (7). School Leaders  consistently used evidence based feedback to improve individual and school-wide practices specifically using the IIT  Recommendation: “The school leader should immediately implement explicit tracking protocols to regularly monitor  school goals, and revise where necessary, so that progress toward achieving goals is known at all times by school  leaders, teachers, staff, students, and parents” resulted in the implementation of our “Noticings & Wonderings”  protocol where each week, the Assistant Principals as well as other staff members conduct focused walk-throughs as  SLC and Departmental team collaborations thereby collecting low inference evidence across the school for the  “Noticings” statements that are generated. During SLC and Departmental team collaborations, the “Noticings” are  reviewed and “Wonderings” are generated along with “Next Steps.” This transparent protocol has enabled the LICHS  school community to show interim levels of impact in leadership practices, teacher practices, and student practices.

The CST is committed to the development of a safe and productive learning environment that fosters a  meaningful and respectful collaboration among students, staff, parents/guardians, and the community in order to  achieve common goals. Representatives from each of those constituencies share all data, findings, proposed action  plans, activities and strategies to address the determined needs with all of their colleagues. Transparent collaboration  among and between the entire school community ensures that our goals will be achieved. This includes our CBO  partnership with Zone 126 which will support LICHS with activities to engage families, and enable school personnel to  better meet the needs of students and families by providing professional development to support the activities for staff  and families.    With a strong focus on promoting literacy and communication skills across the curriculum, instruction will be delivered  through four theme-based smaller learning communities. Our curriculum is shaped by the consistent collection and  analysis of data, rituals and routines, active engagement, and opportunities to apply new knowledge supporting a  culture of responsibility, citizenship, and self-directed, lifelong learning. All staff members engage in weekly inquiry  designed to improve student outcomes.    All teacher programs are designed around designated common planning time (CPT) periods of the SLC that the teacher  has membership in. Each day during CPT there is a specific activity for the team including academic inquiry, behavioral  inquiry and outreach, individualized tutoring, case conferencing and assessment. The structure supports teacher  collaboration, teacher-student and teacher-family supports in that time provided for focused collaborations to improve  student outcomes. Support staff such as the Behavioral Support Teachers, Guidance Counselor, Attendance Teacher,  and Peer Collaborative Teacher as well as the Assistant Principal/SLC Director. Students know where to find key  personnel that will support their success at LICHS. Students are programmed based on their SLC choice with the four  core content area classes (ELA, Math, Social Studies, Science) within their specific SLC. An example of this would have a  student who chose to be in the Culinary Arts SLC would be in academic classes like ELA where the teacher and students  in the class are in the CUL SLC. This enables teachers of different disciplines to have conversations within SLCs about  common students’ achievement, behavior and needs.    Formal and informal observations are conducted using the Danielson Framework with specific domains to be focused  on, particularly in Domain 3 (teacher pedagogy). Teachers and their instructional supervisors meet initially to determine  teacher goals for the year. Feedback is provided, focusing on a pre and post observation feedback model for the  majority of classroom evaluations. Administrators and teachers participate in initial department wide walkthroughs to  identify patterns and trends, thereby followed by weekly focused instructional walk-throughs where the Noticings and  Wonderings protocol is used to gather data around instructional practices. The non-evaluative findings are shared with  all departments and SLCs in order to address identified strategic shifts in pedagogy. Evaluative and non-evaluative  feedback is based on observation cycles that are timely and provide clear, actionable feedback with time bound next  steps.    Communication structures ensure shared accountability by all. All pedagogues participate in weekly PD on Wednesdays  where common themes are personalized by department along with daily CPT meeting activities where data analysis  occurs and finding are shared. Representatives from those activities share their team’s work with school leaders at  weekly Leadership Committee meetings.    Through distributive leadership decisions are made with input from all representative constituencies. The Principal and  Community School Director collaborate to support the school as a Community School. Open communication, and  focused feedback build trust to enable all constituencies to take part in the decision making process at LICHS.    Based on extensive data analysis, the Renewal Committee has decided that improvement in the school’s graduation rate  will drive our commitment to the Effective School Leadership component of the Capacity Framework. We were  determined to achieve the benchmark set for us as a Renewal School of 72.3% for the 4 year graduation rate and we  exceeded the original Renewal Benchmark by achieving a 75.57% graduation rate as of August 2018 for Cohort T.    2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          39      According to the March 2018 NYC Quality Review indicator 3.4: High Expectations was determined to be Well  Developed. Previous NYC Quality Reviews also indicated "Ten of 12 students interviewed knew what they needed to do  to advance to the next level and what the requirements are for their graduation...The assistant principal, teachers and  guidance counselors meet with students who are not meeting expectations, to agree on attendance goals and action  steps to ensure that the students’ improve their performance. In addition, the guidance department leads workshops  for students across grade levels, focusing on goal setting and requirements for graduation, promotion and college  admission. Graduation and promotion requirements are also outlined in student friendly language in a student  handbook. The handbook spells out expectations for academic and personal behavior, such as “evaluate yourself and  your peers based on standard criteria”, and gives an overview of the Common Core Standards and their connection to  learning goals for all content areas." This is facilitated by the SLC structures, through which all essential communication  between and among staff, students, and families occurs.    Our partnership with Zone 126 the Community Based Organization (CBO) who's mission is driving community  transformation for children and families in Astoria and Long Island City has been subsequently been strengthened based  on these NYCDOE QR recommendations. The work of Zone 126 will be detailed in Part 2 and in section 7.            On which aspects of your own leadership do you plan to focus for the upcoming school year?  School Leaders will focus on providing regular effective and actionable feedback to improve student outcomes. During  weekly Cabinet meetings, instructional leadership will share data, findings, needs, PD, observation summaries and " Noticings and Wonderings" findings to improve their capacity to support improved teacher practices and improve  student achievement.         What is your vision for ensuring that everyone in your schools has a normed and shared understanding of the school’s  vision, mission, and instructional focus?   The continuation of the Noticings and Wonderings protocol for Instructional Rounds at the teacher team and classroom  levels will ensure that the vision, mission and instructional focus are understood by all constituencies. The protocol has  become systemic at LICHS as a result of consistent implementation and staff by-in.           What is your vision for developing differentiated leadership throughout your school? How will you utilize teacher  leaders to build broad capacity within your school?   SLC teacher teams and the levels of their differentiated supports throughout the school allow for the enhancement of  teacher leadership at LICHS. The implementation of SLC CPT, Instructional Cabinet sharing, and multiple ways of regular  transparent communication between and among constituencies have enabled distributive leadership where all  stakeholders are heard.         How will the leader foster collaborative school governance processes, and ensure full family participation together  with other stakeholders?  Full participation by all constituencies in SLT, SLC and Community School teams ensure that all constituencies have an  active and reciprocal voice in the school's governance process. The CBO representative, 2 Parent Coordinators and PA  President collaborate with school leaders to ensure improved family participation. Finally Fall and Spring Family Night  and Town Halls provide multiple opportunities to survey families.          2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          40         How often will the school leader conduct observations?

Programming began Spring 2018 with a preliminary design program based on then current and programmatic choices  by incoming 9th grade students through the NYCDOE Office of Enrollment. Student needs and projected new student  needs following summer school and add over the counter zoned student enrollment, allowing for SLC choice. Teacher  programs are designed to meet those needs. Each marking period reviews of student enrollment and program ensure  student needs are met and academic outcomes are enhanced. Changes are made to student programs on a case by case  basis, based on an SLC team review.         Part 3 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools – Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be consistent with the  expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART –  Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact  meeting at least one of your Renewal Benchmarks and/or Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks.  By August 2019, the four year graduation rate of Cohort U will be at least 78.5%, 3% higher and exceeding the 2017- 2018 August 2018 NYC Renewal Community Schools Program Benchmark performance of 75.57% for Cohort T as  measured by RCOS.         Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Effective School Leadership Annual Goal:  Which Renewal and/or Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks do you expect will improve by meeting your Effective  School Leadership Annual Goal?   a) 4 Year Graduation Rate ranges from 72.3% to 83.4%.   b) Strong Family Community-Ties ranges from 3.00 to 3.30.   c) Rigorous Instruction ranges from 3.00 to 3.30.       2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          41     Part 4 – Action Plan   Key Initiatives:  Concisely indicate the  key initiatives (up to  five) that your school  will implement to  achieve the identified  goal for this  Framework for Great  Schools element.   ● The SLC structure  designed to maximize  impact on all critical  areas: student  achievement,  attendance, discipline,  credit accumulation,  parent engagement,  and social emotional  development.      ● Students have  regular access to  Social Workers,  Guidance Counselors,  their teachers when  not assigned to teach  a class, BSTs, and the  SLC Director/AP in the  central location of the  HUB.      ● Guidance  Counselors, SLC  Teacher Teams and  Leadership review  report cards and "line  skeds" for students  failing 1 or more  courses.

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   Based on extensive data analysis, the Renewal Committee has decided that improvement in the school’s graduation rate  will drive our commitment to the Strong Family-Community Ties component of the Capacity Framework. We are  determined to achieve the benchmark set for us as a Renewal School of 72.3% for the 4 year graduation rate.    Quality Review indicator 3.4: High Expectations has been determined to be Well Developed since 2015. The May 2018  findings indicated "Ten of 12 students interviewed knew what they needed to do to advance to the next level and what  the requirements are for their graduation...The assistant principal, teachers and guidance counselors meet with  students who are not meeting expectations, to agree on attendance goals and action steps to ensure that the students’  improve their performance.

The handbook spells out  expectations for academic and personal behavior, such as “evaluate yourself and your peers based on standard criteria”,  and gives an overview of the Common Core Standards and their connection to learning goals for all content areas." This  is facilitated by the SLC where most of the communication between staff, students, and families occurs.    The December 2014 IIT recommended: “The school leader should immediately establish collaboration among leaders,  teachers, student support staff, students, and parents to implement a system of protocols to identify, address, and  monitor the social and emotional developmental health needs of the diverse population of students in the school.”  Upon reflecting how the school has addressed this SOP, while protocols for communication between staff and students  and their families are in place to ensure that academic success is of highest priority at LICHS, it had not impacted   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          47      students’ academic, social and emotional outcomes as intended. Modifications in the SLC structure have addressed that  weakness. The IIT found the following strengths:     The structure of SLC supports students and families with Behavioral Support Teacher, Lead Teacher (now called   Peer Collaborative Teachers: PCTs with revised responsibilities to address changes in the SLC structure), Social  Worker. In each SLC one day of the week is dedicated to Case Conferencing.     The SLCs supports have created activities to engage families beyond our Open Houses and Freshman  Orientation for incoming students. SLC events, Honor Roll and Perfect Attendance ceremonies, “Most  Improved” ceremonies are celebrated with impressive turnout by all constituencies.    Our partnership with Zone 126 the Community Based Organization (CBO) who's mission is driving community  transformation for children and families in Astoria and Long Island City has been subsequently been strengthened based  on those recommendations. The work of Zone 126 will be detailed Part 2 and in section 7.         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Strong Family and Community Ties   What is your vision for having strong family and community ties at your school?   Zone 126 in collaboration with Long Island City High School will work to host 2 summits (Family Night and Community  School Breakfast-Forum) in which parents and students of the school community have the opportunity to meet and  better understand the full scope of the partnership, and all the school has to offer. Zone 126 and their partners will  continue to provide workshops for families on how to communicate effectively with their child and how to support the  holistic development of the student. In addition, parent workshops will focus on strengthening the communication  between home to school life.      Zone 126’s Community School Director is part of the team that welcomes all incoming 9th grade students at Freshmen  Family Orientations. Zone 126 reaches out to all incoming 9th grade students’ parents via phone, email or regular mail to  ensure families understand the Community School model and participate in the Summer Bridge Program.      The Community School Director provides regular updates at the weekly Community School Team Meetings on  achievements, concerns and needs to support the collaboration.   Zone 126 in collaboration with Long Island City High School will continue to bring professional development trainings for  teachers to support academic and socio-emotional initiatives.       Zone 126 will continue their support in the College and Career readiness benchmark by providing mentoring services  and assistance in helping plan a path to entrance beyond their high school life.       Long Island City High School has always provided Zone 126 (the CBO) with a dedicated space within the school. Through  the Community Schools efforts, the Principal has designated a larger space. The room is the central space for Zone 126  partners that will help coordinate and roll out services with. Zone 126 will work with Long Island City High School,  located in Room 650 and within access to the student cafeteria, into a resource area for students to utilize and build  parent/family engagement from there.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          48         Zone 126 will host several workshops for families to introduce them to the different program options of Long Island City  High School through its neighboring school and continuing to bridge the pipeline.      As of September 2018, Zone 126 has been awarded a USDOE full -service community school grant to implement a  neighborhood community school strategy for Pre K -12 grades that include PS 171Q Peter G. Van Alst Elementary  School, a Pre-K -5thgrade school and IS 126Q Albert Shanker, for Visual & Performing Arts from 6th-8th grades. This USDOE  award was building upon the successes of the NYCDOE Community School grant at Long Island City High School.         Within the Community School model, how will families be welcomed into the school and made a part of the school  community?  What support will administrators, teachers, school staff and school safety officers be given to help create  a welcoming environment?   Will there be a dedicated space for families in the school?    Every May and June, LICHS and Zone 126 participate in articulation for the rising 9th graders at their middle schools. This  introduction helps address program needs and promote the Summer Bridge Program. All incoming Freshmen who are  identified as at-risk or chronically absent receive a home visit to emphasize the importance of daily attendance. Our  four SLC hubs in Room 585, 548, 212 and 127 are supportive spaces for our school community. Finally, Room 185, home  of our two Parent Coordinators is also the welcome space for families.             How will the school identify and develop families to take leadership roles in school decision making/school  governance structures?  In the beginning of the school year, LICHS and Zone 126 host a Fall Community School Forum that is targeted to  engaging families and identifying emerging parent leaders. Also, the school hosts Breakfast with the Principal two  Fridays per month to allow any parent to express important perspectives on school and student structures.            How will the school engage the community and families? How will they ensure that teachers are able to learn from  families about the children being taught?  The use of Pupilpath and the teachers’ required use of Skedula, as per the school wide grading policy provides weekly  opportunities for reciprocal communication. The implementation of two SLC cohort connected Parent Coordinators  ensure that information is provided to families and children in the students' and families' preferred language.          What types of supports does the school provide to families to encourage them to take an active role in what their  child is learning?

Will there be dedicated space for  families?    Family partnerships with  school:   All incoming Freshmen were invited to join the Summer Bridge Program via  Welcome letter from LICHS and Zone 126 and 113 participated. All incoming  Freshmen who are at-risk or chronically absent in order set the standard and  emphasize the importance around daily attendance. All new staff to LICHS will  partake in a 2-hour orientation on Community Schools and the role of the lead CBO  in helping to fulfill the Community School Vision. The Parent Coordinators’ space is  also the welcoming space for families.   Family partnerships with CBO:      By August 29, 2018 the Freshmen class was contacted by Zone 126 staff and  introduced to their role in our Community School. Zone 126 staff members will  invite parents to the upcoming Parent Association Meetings and Coffee and  Conversation sessions.      Is there dedicated space for  these partnerships?   The Community Schools office is a central location. Other CBOs, based on need, are  provided dedicated support services through the model in the 345 suite.      What is your vision for the role the school will take in providing access adult education classes within the community?   LICHS's vision is aligned with Zone 126's vision for every child to graduate from high school prepared for college, and  enter the workforce equipped with the skills needed to thrive in a 21st century world. Zone 126 has a linkage agreement  with NYC DOE OACE to provide adult education courses to parents/families at Long Island City High School. After doing  an initial scan at the beginning of the school year, the Community School Director in collaboration with the Vice  President of Collective Impact Partnerships will make a determination if enough adults are available to participate in an  ESL, TASC or Digital Literacy class that can be housed at the school, or referred to the neighboring schools PS 171Q,  and/or IS 126Q where Zone 126 also partners in adult education.          What data and student progress feedback loops will be present at the school to ensure that families knowledgeable of  their children’s scholastic success?  Regular opportunities for families to meet with SLC teacher teams will provide opportunities for parents to regularly  receive feedback on their children's progress.

Describe how the school will meet the NYCDOE requirements for a Community School in the School Renewal  program.  1.   Renewal Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and together  with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will lead  implementation of the asset and needs  assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Renewal Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs  assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Renewal Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and families  feel welcome,  actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of their  schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this  family  engagement strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Renewal School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Prior to hiring candidates, their credentials are verified by our BFSC's Human Resources Director to ensure that the  candidate holds a valid NYS certification in that license area. The BEDS survey is reviewed by the Principal and the HR  Director who work with our school to ensure that every teacher ’ s assignment aligns with their license area so that all  teachers are reported as Highly Qualified on the BEDS Survey.    Strategies and activities used to attract high-qualified teachers to our school include:    Frequent communication with our FSC HR Director when vacancies occur.    Central Office of Talent and Recruitment partners with colleges and the FSC HR Director partners with Central for  assistance and guidance and for candidate referrals.    Participating in Central Hiring Fair events where pre-screened HQT candidates are interviewed and recruited.    Establishing a partnership with a local college to support the grooming of student teachers in our search of HQT  candidates.    Interviewing HQT candidates from The Open Market Hiring System and The Absent Teacher Reserve (ATR) Pool.    Establishing a rigorous interview protocol that includes intensive criteria for the selection of new staff members  including demonstration lessons, interviews, and New York State certification/licensing.    Maintaining a teacher resource center and professional library to promote promising and effective practices.    Teachers will be provided with curriculum maps, instructional resources and professional learning opportunities.    Individualized PD plans are created for teachers to ensure continued improvement.    In the very rare event, if a teacher ’ s status was deemed not HQT, the principal would consult with the FSC HR  Director for guidance to ensure that the non-HQT teacher will meet all required documentation and assessment   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          71      deadlines.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (RSCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated. Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program  activity has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          74        Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          75      Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)        (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Long Island City High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Long Island City High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:       ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;    ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;    ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;    ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;    2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          76      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;    ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;    The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:    ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;    ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;    ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;    ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Our  dual language program started in the 2015-2016 SY and consists of non-ELLs and former ELLs.  There are 35 students currently in the program and 14 incoming 9th graders who have selected  the Dual Program for the 2018-19 SY making the total 9-12th grade Dual Language population  49 students. Our ENL Only program has 240 students.    We will gain 94 current ELLs and 124 former ELLs in our 9th grade cohort for the 2018-19 SY.  We will continue to target 9th, 10th, and 11th grade ELLs for supplemental assistance  determined by credit accumulation and assessment data based on trends in these indicators for  our ELLs. To ensure that our 11th graders accumulate credits and attain skills necessary for  successful matriculation, we will review Regents data, periodic assessments, credit accumulation  data and transcripts to align interventions and supplemental assistance with areas of identified  academic need. We will target ELLs needing additional academic supports for Title III Saturday  Academy courses in the fall semester of the 2018-19 school year using data from June 2018 and  the August Regents assessment data as well as our in-house student tracker. The Fall Title III  Saturday Academy will run on Saturdays from 9:00 AM to 3:30 PM with two sessions. Session  one runs from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Session two runs from 12:30 PM to 3:30 PM. The  proposed dates for the Fall Saturday Academy are: 9/15, 9/22, 9/29, 10/6, 10/13, 10/20, 10/27,  11/3, 11/10, 11/17, 12/1, 12/8, 12/15, 1/5, 1/12, and 1/19. There are the 16 proposed  Fall  Saturday Academy dates.    The Spring Title III Saturday Academy will also run two sessions on Saturdays from 9:00 AM to  12:00 PM and from 12:30 PM to 3:30 PM. The proposed dates are: 2/2, 2/9, 3/2, 3/9, 3/16, 3/23,  3/30, 4/6, 4/13, 5/4, 5/11, 5/18, 5/25, 6/1, 6/8, and 6/15. There are 16 proposed Spring Saturday  Academy dates.    The data below is based on credit accumulation from the final marking period of the 2017-18  school year. We use data from our ELL subgroups to identify areas of greatest need and to plan  interventions for our ELL population. Based on the data, there will be 172 ELLs targeted for  services and interventions paid for by the Title III Grant reflecting the students who had at-risk  levels of 3 or greater. The supervision of the grant will be provided by the Title I supervisor.    In 2017-18, 9th grade ELLs had a 67.8% credit accumulation overall. The course with the lowest  credit accumulation (57.7%) was CCLS Algebra I. Entering 9th grades students had a 60% credit  accumulation for this course, emerging 9th graders had a 0% pass rate, transitioning 9th graders  had a 62.5%, and expanding 9th graders had a 60.3% pass rate. Saturday Academy math  supports will target these rising 10th graders and entering 9th graders. The Saturday Academy   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          84         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   sessions will be taught by a licensed math teacher, preferably with a Spanish-speaking  background and will be supported by an NLA or ELA staff member. Activities from Achieve  3000 will be used to strengthen students' ability to read math related text. Each student will  receive a word-for-word glossary in their own language to keep as a resource.    The courses with the lowest credit accumulation for ELLs were Algebra, Living Environment  and year 2 Global History. These content areas coincide with the results of the other subgroups  and Saturday Academy interventions will be covered by Title III teachers. All courses will be  taught in English with ENL and NLA supports as needed for the target populations.  The Global History, Algebra I, Algebra II, and Living Environment Regents results and credit  accumulation patterns suggest need for direct instruction supplemental programs to address  reading and writing skills across content areas. After school tutoring will be provided throughout  the school year to ensure that ELLs master the literacy skills necessary for their academic  success. Castle Learning and Achieve3000 will be utilized as resources to provide access to  grade-level texts for reading for understanding activities.  The following is a description of the demographics of ELLs at LIC. We have 107 students with  0-3 years of service, 48 students at the developing level (4-6 years), 111 students who are long- term ELLs (over 7 years), and 6 students identified as SIFE. We also have 44 students who are in  their first year of Commanding level ELL services and 47 students in their second year of  Commanding level ELL service. In addition, 908 students of our school’s 2232 students are  former ELLs; this is 40.6% of the total school population. Overall, one can see that LIC students  improve in proficiency each year by looking at the comparison of how many ELLs are at grade  levels. In 9th grade there are 5 entering ELL, 18 emerging ELLs, 40 transitioning ELLs, and 79  expanding ELLs. In grade 10, the number of entering ELLs is 1, emerging is 5, transitioning is  22, and expanding is 33. The number of ELLs in 11th grade declines with 1 entering ELL, 4  emerging ELLs, 11 transitioning ELLs, and 20 expanding ELLs. Our 12th grade population has  similarly diminished with 1 entering ELL, 2 emerging ELLs, 14 transitioning ELLs, and 10  expanding ELLs.  There are eight licensed ESL teachers in the ENL department. They are: Wilfred A. Cameron,  Leonore T. Smith, Chrisa Kenny, Guoping Wang, Cindy T. Peng, Alma Siljkovic, Paul Romano,  and Christopher J. Watkins. We also have one Bilingual Special Education teacher--Karen  Murrillo. In addition, we have several bilingual Spanish-Speaking teachers who are licensed in  content areas and who teach our ELLs in supplemental programs: Javier Cifuentes  (Biology),  Jocelyn Oviedo (Earth Science), Fernando Villegas, Vito Castaneda, and Jose Soto  (Math), Melissa Diaz, Raul Gordillo,  and Christine Gomez (Social Studies). Most of these  teachers have participated in Title III programs in the past and will most likely be part of  supplemental instruction during the 2018-19 school year. The teachers involved in the Title III  classes and other teachers who work with ELLs will receive 1 and ½ days of Achieve 3000  training from a Robert Morantz, a staff developer from Achieve 3000. Since teachers have been  using this program for 5 years, the nature of the PD will be to learn how to use the new  alignment to CCLS and the College and Career readiness components that have been built into  this program. This PD is building on already acquired knowledge. The half day will take place  during mandated department PD time and during the Global Languages Academy daily small  learning community meeting to introduce the new material. The full day PD will take place as  job-embedded support.   The teachers named above will provide after school tutoring for students’ 2018-19 courses. The  purpose of the tutoring will be to strengthen academic understanding and prepare students to be  college and career ready. These after school tutoring sessions will take place from Monday  through Friday from 3:43 PM to 5:16 PM. Tutoring will be provided on an as-needed basis and  will be paid with Title I funds.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          85         Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             ESL License:   Wilfred A.

Most of these teachers have taught in Title III programs in the past and  some will be part of the supplemental instruction during the 2018-19 school year.    Achieve 3000 is an important part of our non-fiction literacy building curriculum for ELLs and  our Dual Language program. It is currently used by our ENL teachers with their students in the  daily independent reading sequence of ELA/ENL courses. In addition, this year we expanded its  use to the Dual Language program. DL Students are using Achieve 3000 in Spanish to build  academic language skills and to measure and monitor the improvement of students' capacity to  read higher grade level texts in the Spanish language in Science, Social Studies and Math. Each  Title III student will have a user name and password for their Title III class. Teachers of ELLs  can also use this resource as a means of assigning leveled classwork, homework, or extra credit.  Achieve 3000 can also be used to create writing assignments in the Title III content areas (Living  Environment, Earth Science, and Math).  The teachers involved in the Title III classes and other teachers who work with ELLs will receive  one and one half days of Achieve 3000 training from Robert Morentz, a staff developer from  Achieve 3000. Since teachers have been using this program for 5 years, the nature of the PD will  be to learn how to use the new alignment to CCLS which has been added into this program. This  PD is building on already acquired knowledge. The half day will take place during mandated PD  time on Wednesday, September 12th or Wednesday, September 26th. The full day PD will take  place on Thursday, September 27, 2018 as job-embedded support. No coverages or per diem will  be needed because we are using either mandated PD time or a job-embedded model. Title III  funds will contribute to purchasing a portion of the 250 licenses that will be used for ELL  students in Title III classes.

It will  be taught by a licensed ESL or Foreign Language teacher. It is open to all parents; however,  parents of ELLs will have preference and will be given priority to participate.  These are the  dates for the FALL Saturday ENL Parent ESL classes:  9/22, 10/6, 10/20, 11/3, 11/17, 12/8, 1/5,  and 1/19.  These classes will be paid using Title III funding. The language of instruction will be  English. The Parent Coordinators, Maria Cancemi and Awatef Ibrahim will be responsible for  recruiting parents for these classes. Snacks will be provided for parent at each session paid for  from Title III funds.    The Spring Title III Parent ELL classes will take place on Saturdays from 9:00 AM - 10:20 AM   – and 10:30 AM to 12:00PM every other Saturday in which Title III sessions are offered. It will  be taught by a licensed ESL or Foreign Language teacher. It is open to all parents; however,  parents of ELLs will have preference and will be given priority to participate.

The language of instruction will be English.  The Parent Coordinators, Maria Cancemi and Awatef Ibrahim will be responsible for recruiting  parents for these classes. Snacks will be provided for parent at each session paid for from Title  III funds.    Based on previous 2016-17 data of parents attending the ELL Annual Parent Meetings, a  majority of parents came to the Saturday session (59%), as opposed to the remaining 41% who  attended the school-day sessions. To give parents more motivation to attend the ELL Annual  Meeting, the meetings will be held during Title III Saturday Academy starting from Sep 15,  2018. Meetings will also be scheduled before and after school Mondays through Fridays in an  attempt to increase family participation from the 15% participation of 2017-18. The meetings  will be facilitated by a Spanish bilingually certified guidance counselor, either Yesinia Fermin or  Cindy Obregoso and these counselors will be assisted by our social worker, Mr. Alan Smart and  supported by Mr. Villegas, our LAB/BESIS Coordinator and Mr. Mudd, AP Organization and  ENL Compliance AP. Each session will have translation services available for other languages  through either on-site staff or DOE phone translation services.    Having the Parent ESL classes scheduled concurrently with the ELL Annual Parent Meetings  will give parents who want to attend an ENL class an opportunity to also attend their ELL  Annual Parent Meeting either from 9:00 AM – 10:30 or 10:30 AM until 12:00 Noon. The  facilitation costs of the ELL Annual Parent Meeting will be paid for with funds other than Title  III funds; however, having these two events scheduled on the same morning at different times  will increase participation of both the ENL classes and the ELL Annual Parent Meetings.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          87   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?           Long Island City is a full comprehensive high school offering academic, career and college ready programs to all our  students. Current enrollment is 2021 students of which 12.12% are ELLs.  15.54% of our students have Integrated Services and  3.11% of ELLs receive ISS support. In addition,  50.61% of our ENL students are former ELLs with 124 (6.14%) who continue to  receive additional instructional support and testing accommodations per Part 154 regulations.  We have two programs to  serve ELLs at LICHS- an ENL only program and a dual language Spanish - English program which is entering its third year of  implementation in the 2017-18 academic year.   While 145 of our ESL students are Spanish speaking, parental choice largely  favors stand-alone ENL. 181 families selected the stand-alone model of ENL instruction with 99 9th grade families, 50 10th  grade families, 23 11th grade families, and 9 12th grade families selecting the stand-alone model. There are insufficient  numbers of parents requesting the Transitional Bilingual Education model of instruction at each grade level in order to justify   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          90      opening TBE classes at this time.  Only 25 families in total chose the TBE model-6 families from 9th graders, 4 families from  10th grade, 9 families from 11th grade, and 6 families from 12th grade. We are hoping that parents of our over-the-counter  students consider choosing the Spanish-English Dual Language program.         We have several systems in place to monitor the  progress of our students throughout the year.  Some of our monitoring is school-wide and ELLs participate equally with their  classmates.  This year we are administering the New York City Performance Tasks in ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies to  all students. These exams provide a baseline to prioritize instructional supports.  ENL and ELL content area teachers analyze  summative and baseline assessments to modify curriculae across content areas in order to address the language support  needs of ELLs.         In addition, there is a specific monitoring system that provides teachers with monthly reports on reading  competency improvement.  Achieve 3000 is a online reading and writing support program.  Students are given a pre-test to  establish their current Lexile reading level.  This Lexile level will be the level of the reading assignments they receive which has  the same content as their classmates; however, it is customized to that particular student's curreent reading  readiness.  Students have assignments reading non-fiction at least twice a week and need to write about what they read and  take a multiple choice test at the end of each activity to test reading comprehension.  At any point during the school year,  teachers and students can review the data of their progress and make adjustment to their practice.  Moreover, Achieve 3000  creates student and school-wide reports end of each month, students and teachers receive feedback on student progress.  If a  student was able to score at 75% or higher on 4 activities during the month, their Lexile will adjust to a higher level and the  student will receive more challenging work.  Students become aware that more effort and careful reading increases their  ability to understand not only the articles in Achieve 3000 but also their content area reading becomes more  understandable.  This motivates some students to put extraordinary effort into their work on Achieve 3000. The information  from the data from the program is also integrated into other literacy initiatives. We use the Exam History report from ATS to  identify which students have tested out within the last two years.  These students are assigned Extended Learning Time  courses such as Lunch and Learn  or Breakfast and Books classes taught by a licensed ENL teacher for two or three times a  week for 45 minutes periods to address continued literacy development.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Long Island City High School is organized through an active school leadership team and through several support structures to  ensure that curriculum embedded and school-wide assessments of our students are administered and reviewed at regular  intervals to drive instructional modifications and inform decisions on programming and supports for our English Language  Learners. Assessments are organized and administered within academic departments across the core content areas and in  Native Language Arts classes. Data from assessments in Math, Sciences, and Social Studies is analyzed with the assistance of  the Skedula/Pupil Path online assessment generator tool. Results of item analysis from these reports are shared both  departmentally and within the cross-content SLCs: the school is divided into four Smaller Learning Communities, or SLCs, each  with a supervising Assistant Principal, academic guidance counselor, behavioral supports teacher, social worker, and parent  outreach coordinator. Each SLC has academic inquiry teams for each grade level that meet to review data according to a  calendar of formative and summative assessments. These inquiry teams suggest changes to instruction and curriculum as well  as implement supports according to structured ongoing review of student product. Additionally, LIC shares information on  progress monitoring as well as on city and state assessments through our data team. The Assistant Principal of Organization  and Compliance, the programming office, and our data analysis team, all work to share results on assessments with the school  community.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We are exceeding AMAO 2 by almost 100%.  We have twice as many students testing out as required by the AMAO.  We do  not have AMAO1 data available to us as of June 29th, 2017 for the 2016-2017 school year. This is the best indicator of our  students growth.  Also, we have 62% of our students who tested out last year on-track for graduation. We continue to see  progress in our ELLs. This is evident in the fact that a consistent trend is that there are  fewer ELLs at the Junior and Senior  levels than at the 9th and 10th grade levels. The number of current ELLs  in the junior and senior years combined, 55,  is only  22% of our total ENL population, while 9th and 10th graders are currently 77% percent of the population. In 2015-16, the  percentage of 11th and 12th grade ENL students comprised 33% of the overall ENL population which shows that ENL  proficiency has improved at 11% over the previous year. While the CC ELA Regents passing rate for ELLs and former ELLs  declined from the June 2016 combined passing percentage of 43% to a combined ELL and former ELL passing percentage of   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          91      30% this June 2017,  we have seen overall gains of 1 to 2 points on the written portions of the CC ELA Regents with the higher  ELL gains occurring on Part 2, the argument essay. One area where ELLs need additional support, as revealed by an analysis of  the REDS report for the June 2016, January 2017, and June 2017 Regents, is reading intensive multiple choice questions and  text dependent questions across content areas, especially for Entering and Emerging ELLs. This data further supports the  decision to focus on tier I and tier II vocabulary as well as annotation skills and decoding strategies.  To assess areas of progress and areas of need, we utilize NYC Performance Tasks in Math, Social Studies, and English Language  Arts as a whole school baseline as well as an interim and summative assessment. In September and October initial  performance tasks are administered along with HLA assessments. We utilize the ELL periodic assessment. We also administer a  writing assessment and reading assessment at the beginning of the school year and again in May to identify areas of need. This  year, we have been reviewing Regents data across content areas to identify areas of progress and of need. We are looking at  Common Core Algebra and Geometry results and correlating the passing rates to home language, years of ELL service, and  levels of English proficiency in order to better adjust programming and curriculum to the needs of our students. We are also in  the process of updating a Home Language Reading and Writing assessment for our Spanish speaking students and will need to  translate this revised assessment for other language groups in our school, especially our higher frequency languages-Arabic  and Bengali.          4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once summative assessment data has been gathered, the programming office, department APs, Peer Collaborative Teachers,  and Guidance corellate and analyze data to identify trends, measure progress, and identify areas needing further academic  intervention and support. The programming office and department APs work to enroll students in necessary courses over the  summer or in enrichment courses through Title III summer programs and guidance counselors contact families to make them  aware of the acdemic needs of their child. Each SLC has an academic inquiry team that works to analyze summative data,  identify trends, and assess the efficacy of the interventions. These interdisciplinary teams then use the PDSA model of  strategic inquiry to make changes to interventions, recommend shifts in curriculum and pedagogy, and implement further  interventions. ELLs needing additional supports may be enrolled in an ELT opportunity or may be referred to academic  intervention services such as peer, small group, or one-on-one tutoring. Small Learning Communities continue to assess the  effectiveness of interventions and make modifications through the inquiry process. The accreditation committee may meet to  approve any courses or ELTs created to address academic needs and out PD committee and UFT teacher center, along with  model teachers and PCTs will provide supports for planning, delivering and reflecting on the progress of students through  inter-visitations, learning walks, and analyzing student work products. Interim assessments are utilized at regular intervals in  the school year to assess the interventions.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    According to 2015 NYSESLAT data, our total ELL population decreased by 4%.  In 2013-2014, the ELL population was 13.7% of  LIC student body. In 2014-2015, it was 14.7% of the LIC student body. As we end the 2016-17 academic year, our ELLs  comprise 12.12% of the total student population.  The composition of the ELL population varies by home language group,  presenting the need for customized interventions for subsets of the ELL population at LIC. Where students who identify Arabic  as a home language have less years of service than other language groups, this subset has a higher percentage of students  with Transitioning and Expanding level NYSESLAT scores and the 22 students in the Arabic speaking subset boast math scores  for each grade level ranging from 44% to 77% on the June Common Core Algebra exam.  Our Bengali speaking population,  totalling 32 students across the four grade levels, also have a higher percentage of students with three or less years of ENL  services, but again, the English proficiency levels for this group are mostly at the Transitioning and Expanding level and the  Common Core Algebra scores ranged from 48 to 75% on the most recent Regents exam in June 2017. However, our largest  subset of ELLs, the Spanish-speaking population shows a different trend; of the 149 students, 34% of the students have less   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          92         than 3 year of services, 15% have 4 to 6 years of study, and 44% have 7 or more years of study. 62% of this subset of ELL  students had scores below passing on the Common Core Algebra Regents. This data supports the need to create interventions  in our math curriculum for continuing students in 10th, 11th, and 12th grade.  From NYSESLAT data from the 2015 spring  administration, the highest number of our ELLs scored at the Expanding proficiency level on the 2015 NYSESLAT than any other  proficiency level (84 students tested at Expanding, 58 students tested at Commanding, 44 students tested at Entering, 32  students tested at Transitioning and 30 students tested at Emerging). The 2016 spring NYSESLAT results showed similar trends,  with 122 students testing at Expanding,  38 testing at Commanding, 21 at Entering, 26 at Emerging, and 77 at Transitioning.  We have been effective at moving our Transitioning students to Expanding and our Expanding ELL students gain Commanding  level within a year of gaining advanced literacy skills.  We are less effective in moving our Entering and Emerging students,  especially the long-term ELLs with Spanish language background but low Spanish literacy levels.           We attribute our success  in moving transitioning and expanding level ELLs to the deepening of text-based strategies throughout the year.  Our school- wide focus on explicit writing strategies and annotation skills supported students from these proficiency levels.  We will  continue to monitor and address literacy needs of ELLs by supporting the acquisition of tier I and tier II academic vocabulary  across content areas, stressing annotation strategies, and transitioning to planning text-dependent and text-based writing  tasks. In addition, we will continue to incorporate Writing is Thinking explicit writing instruction into all content area classes.  We will strategically add reading supports and strategies to deepen critical reading skills that are included in WITsi. The explicit  teaching of literacy and embedded literacy practices will be made accessible to ELLs through SIOP models of building a base  and supporting students through appropriately scaffolded activities as well as through an emphasis on acquisition of academic  vocabulary.                  7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Our school leader, instructional cabinet, department APs, and SLC Leadership committee work with our data specialists, our AP  of guidance, and our guidance counselors to share and support the development and monitoring of programs and  interventions for ELL programs. We have an active ENL and NLA team who work within their SLC to recommend adjustments  based on assessment data and findings. The Dual Language consortium for district 30, the DELLSS support, the Office of  Renewal schools, and our internal structures of guidance, programming, and school leadership ensure that findings are shared  and acted upon to best support the needs of our students. We have expanding the LAP committee to include active  participatio of more ENL, ISS, and NLA teachers so that adjustments to programming and to pedagogy can be monitored.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   ENL classes are self-contained and students are programmed according to NYSESLAT or NYSITELL proficiency level  Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding. ENL is its own department, with seven teachers. In  the 2016-17 school year, the ENL department will be supervised by the principal, Vivian Selenikas, and PD will be  supported by the Peer Collaborative Teacher, Leonore Smith, a LEAP candidate who will fulfill her apprenticeship in  the ENL department. Supervision is supported by AP Jason Mudd, programming chair Greg Levine and LAB-BESIS  coordinator Fernando Villegas, as well as AP of the Global Languages SLC Maria Rodriguez to ensure compliance to  Part 154.   LIC HS has 45 minute periods.  Most classes meet 5 days a weekEntering students receive:•     Two periods  of ENL support five days a week with an ENL teacher.•     One period five days a week with an ENL/ELA licensed   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          93         teacher, Alma Siljkovic.  (ELA is the content class.)Emerging students receive:•     One period of ENL instruction with  an ENL teacher five days a week.•     One period of ELA/ENL with both an ENL/ELA licensed teacher 5 periods a week  taught by Alma Siljkovic. ELA is the content.Transitioning students receive:•     One period five days a week with both  an ENL/ELA licenced teacher.  ELA is the content class.Expanding students receive:•     One period five days a week  with both an ENL teacher and an ELA teacher. (ESL is the content class)Commanding students receive:•     One period  2 or 3 days a week with an ENL teacher for approved former ELL services that support ELA acquisition.  There is Home  langauge support in Spanish.  All Spanish speaking ELLs receive Spanish as a Home Langauge Arts.Content area classes  are taught by teachers licensed in those content areas and ENL push-in support is provided based on needs identified  by data on Regents scores and assessments.             b.  TBE program.  If applicable.      Our school is no longer required to have a Transitional Bilingual Spanish program as we do not have enough students  at any grade level whose parents chose Spanish Bilingual as their first choice.  We have 6 students at the 9th grade  level, 4 students at the 10th grade level, 9 students at the 11th  grade level, and 6 students at the 12th grade level.  There is no other language that has 20 or more students on a grade level in one language whose parents have chosen  TBE as the program of choice.  For that reason, and in consultation with Milady Baez, LIC implemented a Dual  Language Spanish-English program instead. 2017-18 will be the third year of the Dual Language Spanish-English  program at LICHS.  There are currently 21 students enrolled as 10th and 11th graders and after articulation efforts and  visits to feeder middle schools, we will have 20 freshmen entering the Dual Language Spanish-English program in the  2017-18 school year.           c.  DL program.  If applicable.      2017-18 will be the third year of implementation of the  Spanish-English Dual Language program. We started with 24  students who were recruited from middle schools specifically for this program.  There are 20 EP students and 2 ELLs  currently enrolled. When students were recruited, some were still ELLs but tested out in 8th grade.  We look to recruit  students from our over-the-counter admits, however, most of those over-the-counter admits are not Spanish  speaking. DL students receive one period of integrated ENL/ELA instruction five periods a week. The two ELLs in the  program receive the appropriate number of minutes according to their proficiency level. They receive one class five  days a week of Spanish NLA supports taught by a licensed Spanish teacher, Krista Correa-Baer.  The are taught one  class five days a week of dual language US History by Melissa Diaz, a licensed Social Studies teacher, and are enrolled  in a dual language Chemistry class five days a week taught by Jocelyn Oviedo.  In addition, Vito Castaneda teaches a  dual language Common Core Algebra class and a second period of Common Core Algebra five days a week.             2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?    At LICHS we ensure that all ELLs receive more than the minimum mandated minutes of instruction in ESL according to CR Part  154. All Entering ELLs at LICHS receive a total of 225 minutes per week of ESL instruction along with 225 minutes  per week of  ENL/ELA and a third period of Integrated ELA with ENL support for another 225 minutes per week.  All Emerging ELLs receive  90 minutes of ENL instruction per week and 8 periods of ENL/ELA 360 minutes a week. Transitioning students receive one  period five days a week of Integrated ENL and ELA with teachers licensed in these areas.  Students at the Expanding proficiency  are programmed one period of ENL/ELA Integrated class five days a week for 225 minutes.  Dual langauge students have the  same ENL/ELA classes as the ESL only students.  In addition, they have their social studies, math and science, health taught by   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          94      teachers who speak Spanish and who teach the content 50% in English and 50% in Spanish.                         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.     Emerging, Entering, Transitioning, and Expanding level ENL students, as well as former ELLs still eligible for support, receive  sheltered ENL content area classes in math, science and social studies when budgetary considerations allow.  Teachers across  content areas have training in SIOP and Writing is Thinking as well as some content teachers who are trained in QTEL  methodology. Data on student progress and achievement is assessed to determine where push in ENL langauge supports will  be most strategic and team teaching models or push in instructional models, for which teams of content and ENL as well as ISS  teachers receive ongoing support and training.  ENL classes include instruction designed to improve achievement in the  content areas through the use of age and grade sappropriate leveled informational text readings.   For example, the use of the  Milestones textbook in stand-alone Entering level ENL classes gives ENL teachers the opportunity to teach and reinforce non- fiction and content area reading and writing strategies.  The Common Core Learning Standards aligned instructional units  require students to ground reading, writing, and argumentation in evidence from texts in ENL, Social Studies, and Science  classes.         In Math classes for ELLs content comes from EngageNY or the Meaningful Math curriculum. This curriculum  includes Spanish language translated materials. In ENL stand-alone classes, there are independent reading books in multiple  languages while textbooks are available in Spanish and English, for Global Studies, World History (La historia del mundo) by  Pearson. In US History, the textbook used is US History by Global Fearon.  The Spanish text is La nacion America by Prentice  Hall.  There is one bilingually licensed teacher teaches US History and Global classes.  She teaches the students in the US  History for Freshman classes and one dual US History.  Each student has a dictionary and a glossary in each class.  There is a  specific vocabulary study each class.  In Science, dual language students are in Chemistry and they are taught by a bilngually  speaking teacher, Jocelyn Oviedo.  This class is taught in a 50% English and 50% Spanish.  There are Living Enviroment classes  taught by Javier Cifuentes, a bilingually licensed Living Environment teacher.  Ciciano Montoya is also a Spanish speaking  Chemistry teacher who provides Spanish Speaking ELLs with support in the home langauge.  In addiiton,  Ijaz Akthar, an Earth  Science teacher, speaks Urdu, Hindi and Arabic.  He is able to support the students who speak these languages in Earth  Science.           4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Spanish-speaking students are administered the Spanish LAB as part of the in-take process. In addition to the NYSITELL and  Spanish LAB exams, LICHS has a placement test for new admits that is  that includes a section where we ask students for  writing samples in both their native language and English.  If this sample leads us to suspect that there are literacy or learning  difficulties, we follow up using either school staff member who speaks the home language of the student or the DOE  translation and Interpretation hotline in order to assure that students with additional needs receive additional services. Also,  students in Spanish HLA classes take a baseline writing assessment to measure students’ writing progress. This exam tests  listening with 4 passages that are read to the student in the native language with multiple choice and short responses  questions. The reading and writing section has one short passage and a long passage with multiple choice questions and essay- like written response required.  This students receive a score for each modality and this information helps create the student's  instructional plan.  In addition all Spanish ELLs take the ELE in May.  The Spanish HLA classes with 11th an 12th graders take the  Spanish LOTE exam or or other LOTE exams.  The AP Spanish Language or Literature exams are given to upper classmen. The  impact of this inititiative to have all HL Spanish students have Advanced Placement courses in their third and/or fourth year of  the HLA sequence respectively was one of the major levers that led to our S Cohort having 21 students qualify for the NYS Seal  of Biliteracy this June 2017. Our Spanish language teachers are working to revise the palcement assessment over the summer  and the school will base enhanced Native Language/Home Langauge Arts assessments on this work, modifying and translating  these assessments for speakers of other languages in our school community.         In both ESL only and Dual HLA language  classes there are classroom informal and formal assessments created by the teacher.  In addition, there are department  created mid-terms and finals in each semester.  These exams ensure that all students are learning the same skills and are   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          95      evaluated in the same way.             5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE students are served by the school's Freestanding ENL program and receive additional services through DELLS supports.  These services include peer-tutoring, Saturday Academy, afterschool NLA and ENL support, and cultural excursions. In  addition, LICHS is able to offer a triple period Entering SIFE class and a double period Emerging SIFE class dependent upon  enrollement numbers, where students receive instruction to accelerate academic skills as well as English language acquisition.  Teachers of SIFE students are supported by providing them with intensive professional development and materials specifically  designed for this ELL subgroup. Teachers of SIFE ELLs received training on the RIGOR program and how to integrate the use of  iPads in SIFE classrooms. This year, our active SIFE numbers are nine students, therefore, this group is incorporated into ENL  level appropriate stand-alone classes and content classes with push in ENL supports.  b. Newcomers present a particular challenge at the high school level because while these students need to learn  communicative English and basic vocabulary, at the same time they need to engage in grade level work across content area  classes in order to stay on track for graduation. We offer newcomers additional services such as peer-tutoring, ELL Saturday  Academy, and NLA and ENL support via Strengthening Bilingual Programs grant, when funding is made available. We also  infuse the ENL classes with literacy and content strategies while providing multiple scaffolds and supports in the content  classes. Teachers of ELLs receive ongoing professional development on ENL strategies from Pearson for SIOP, from the Office  of Renewal Schools, from High Schools that Work (HSTW), Scholastics, Peer Collaborative Teachers, our UFT Teacher Center,  and ENL and content area Assistant Principals.     c. In the last three years, we have implemented and deepened our use of Writing is Thinking strategies across content areas.  Our focus has now included annotation strategies and text decoding to support literacy and reading comprehension. This year  we are deepening the focus on critical reading skills and transitioning from annotation to planning of writing.  We are  optimistic that the current initiatives put in place this year, will result in improved language acquisition and literacy for our  ELLs receiving services for 4-6 years. We are continuing these initiatives because they have proven very successful by  increasing ELA passing rate by five to six percentage points a year.    d. 43 of our 59 Long Term ELLs are also have Integrated Support Services.  These students are in ICT classes at the Expanding  level.  In the three year comparison of progress on the NYSESLAT 34 students were in the Advanced level and are now in the  Expanding level.  It is unclear how progress will be measured at this writing,  given that the exams from 2014-2015 were  different from all the previous years.  It is possible that many of these students have made progress within similar proficiency  levels.  There were 11 students who moved up 1 or 2 levels and on 2 who moved down a level.  11 students did not take the  exam. Since the most common reason for students to be in the long term ELL category is that they are not reading and writing  on grade level in English, we have decided to continue the use of three specific literary strategies for this academic school  year: school-wide annotation strategies, Writing is Thinking sentence and paragraph level skills, and writing to the task  strategies.  This year's academic focus includes more extensive writing based on reading which should result in improved  language acquisition and literacy for our ELLs receiving services for more than 6 years.    e. We continue providing all ELL testing accommodations (double time, translated edition of available assessments, bilingual  interpreter for low incidence languages such as Arabic and Bengali, separate location, bilingual glossary, bilingual word for  word dictionary, third read on listening passages) to all former ELLs in year one and year two after testing Commanding on the  NYSESLAT. We also invite year one and two former ELLs to participate in ELL Saturday Academy and other programs offered to  ELLs always ensuring that current ELLs receive mandated services. We have created a Lunch and Learn programs for former   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          96      ELLs.  They have a class with ENL Push In for with a licensed ENL teacher for two or three days a week., specifically focusing on  the Tier II and Tier III vocabulary in Science and/or Social Studies content classes that will support their continued success as  FELLs.                   6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All teachers of ELLs including ELL-SWD instructors and ISS support staff, receive intensive professional development on ENL  strategies on how to address the needs of this at risk student subgroup via training from the DELLSS, ORS, Pearson SIOP,  HSTW, Scholastic, Achieve 3000, Peer Collaborative Teachers, UFT Teacher Center Teacher, and ENL, ISS and content area  Assistant Principals. Instructional strategies and materials to provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English  language development to ELL-SWDs include the Milestones series, Rewards Reading program, individualized classroom  libraries, iPads, netbooks, audiobooks, and teacher created materials. Content area teachers are provided with grade level  appropriate supports such as content materials either written specifically for ELLs (English 3D and RIGOR) or that provide  appropriate ELL scaffold (DK Eyewitness Books), and audiobooks via the iPad. HMH Collections icludes audio and video  components that allow ELLs points of entry to the content materials while Meaningful Math and EngageNY curriculae utlize  manipulables and realtable scenarios in order to allow students access to rigorous content. All teachers are trained in Writing  is Thinking strategies and are focused on annotation skills and the development of tier II and tier III vocabulary.                 7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  At LICHS ELL-SWDs are served in the least restrictive environment.  This year we have all of our ELL-SWDs in team-taught (ICT)  ESL classes. The criteria for placing ELL-SWDs in ICT classes is governed by students' individualized educational plans  (IEPs).  Also, students' IEPs govern programming of classes not specifically specified to be ICT or SC. For most students, but not  all, this means that they take their core classes, math, science, social studies, and ESL/ELA in a supported model and are  mainstreamed for native language arts and/or foreign language and electives. However, there are exceptions based on IEP  specifications.  For example, certain ELL-SWDs required adaptive Physical Education classes while other students are  mainstreamed. We also offer a self-contained double period class for NYSSA and struggling self-contained ELLs. All  programming decisions for ELL-SWDs are made keeping in mind the best possible way to meet students’ IEP goals.                8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our goal is to move every ELL towards graduation and college-readiness so the interventions and targeted teaching strategies  vary from class to class as appropriate.  This year LICHS will continue to offer the Title III Saturday Academy from November to  June. ELLs will receive instruction focused on Regents preparation and college and career readiness by creating a welcoming  environment that intentionally uses instructional techniques proven to work with ELLs and integration of technology in a wide  variety of classes: Entering, Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding classes as well as Algebra, Geometry, Global Studies, US  History, Living Environment, and Earth Science. LICHS will continue to offer vacation academies for language enhancement and  Regents preparation taking place during the February break and during the Spring Break for four days, four hours per day. This  academy will provide students with strategically planned skills based lessons in preparation for the June Regents examinations.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          97      LICHS will provide additional targeted interventions to SIFE and Long Term ELLs pending the allocation of OELL SIFE-LTE grant  funds. In addition, LICHS will provide targeted intervention to all ELLs via ELT (Extended Learning Time) programs such as  Breakfast and Books before students schedule during periods 1, and 2, and Lunch and Learn during students lunch period.  Also, LICHS will continue providing tutoring through the SLCs, on Wednesdays.   Our Commanding students are provide wth 2-3  periods a week of Lunch and Learn with a certified ESL teacher to support whatever langauge acquistion needs have arisen  from there newly-establish proficiency levels. In addition, we will utilize our piloted 12 grade intern and extern program to  create peer tutoring opportunities for our ELLs.                9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      LICHS will continue to expand the Spanish-English Dual Language Program to include a 9th, 10th and  11th grade cohort based  on the high level of credit accumulation, progress in Spanish and ELA proficiency levels and Regents passing rates for the  group, 11th grade Dual Language students will be enrolled in rigorous coursework including AP Spanish Language, AP English  Language, and advanced math and science courses. To support these students in these rigorous college-level courses, the  students will be programmed into an extra period of Spanish language supports by way of a Spanish language section of the  AVID curriculum co-taught by AP Spanish teacher Flor Carpio and ENL-AVID trained elective teacher Leonore Smith. In addition,  in 2015-16, students who utilzed the Achieve3000 platform for reading and literacy improvements with fidelity saw a 20%  increase in lexile levels, therefore, we will renew the use of Achieve3000 in stand-alone ENL classes as well as NLA Spanish  classes and ELT courses for language enrichment. Improving reading levels and enhancing tier I and tier II vocabulary are a  focus this year since preliminary Regents results and ongoing Regents inquiry and analysis suggest that reading comprehension  is an area of need for our ELLs. To this end, for incoming 9th graders with reading levels at less than a 4th grade lexile level, the  school is piloting the Rewards explicit reading and decoding curriculum with ENL students integrated into these classes. Based  on trends for our long-term Spanish speaking ELLs who have not achieved above an emerging level on the NYSESLAT and who  have not yet been successful on content area regents, we will consider programming and curriculum supports for this group in  order to address skills gaps, language support needs, and content access. One recommendation that we may pilot is to create  programming that includes back-to-back support classes for the content classes in which entering and emerging students have  not yet been successful. For example, students might be enrolled in their grade level specific integrated ENL/ELA course  followed by an ENL stand-along course to deepen and supplement that curriculum. Then student in this subset might have  their level specific mathematics course followed by a section of modified Meaningful Math in which the existing translation  materials in Spanish or ENL and NLA teacher supported scaffolds are utliized. Students would then be programmed for their  social studies course followed by an ENL social studies skills class for writing informational and argumentative essays based on  that content and finally, students in this subset would be enrolled in a single period science class followed by a science  research class. This could be piloted with the 40 students identified by our LAB-BESIS coordinator and could have an 11th and  12th grade section, or the trends could be further researched with implementation beginning in the 2018-19 school year. We  will continue to monitor trends for our over-age and under-credited ELLs in order to create interventions and programs that  can ensure their success. Regents preparation for ELLs who are scoring within the 40-55 range could be mindfully prioritized  with a math and a science regents for the fall semester and a social studies and/or ELA Regents supported in the spring  semester. Modifications for language supports for the new common core aligned Meaningful Math curriculum will begin over  the summer with a content specialist and an ENL and NLA teacher working to identify Tier I and Tier II vocabulary and reduce  the lexile complexity of the reading passages associated with the modules. Saturday academy will be re-evaluated based on  trends and will offer student choice in attending an earlier or later session, from 8:30 to 12:00 or from 12:30-4:00. Global  Languages Academy will also enter a year-of-planning for a National Academies Foundation Career and Technical Education  Program in Informatics. The program, based on student and parent surveys for areas of interest for CTE,  will ensure that ENL  students in the academy have access to quality career and technical training in the growing field of information technology.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   LIC HS no longer has enough parents choosing the TBE Spanish program to justify its existence.  The total number of families  requesting the TBE model of instruction was 25 with only 6  9th grade families, 4  10th grade families, 9 11th grade families,  and 6  12th grade families requesting the model. With permission from Milady Baez, we established a Dual Language Spanish- English program in 2015-16.       2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          98      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  In academic year 2012-2013, LICHS adopted a school wide Smaller Learning Communities (SLC) model. This school model  afforded all students, including ELLs, the opportunity to have equal access to all four SLCs. Returning LICHS ELLs select their  preferred SLC in the spring. Most ELLs choose the Global Languages SLC. However, a significant number of upper classmen  chose other SLCs including Academy of Wellness and Education and the Culinary Academy. Incoming ELLs are placed in the  Global Languages SLC in order to ensure all CR Part 154 compliance is provided to newly arrived ELLs; students may choose to  stay or transfer to a different SLC for the following academic year. All ELLs, including ELL-SWDs, have equal access to all  programs offered at LICHS. ELLs who express interest in Advanced Placement subjects, have access to the school’s wide range  of 26 AP courses. Currently, we have ELLs in most AP classes and have had ENL push in to support higher level sciences courses  such as Chemistry and Physics. There are a number of ENL students enrolled in AP English Language and AP World History  courses as well as higher math classes. We provide all ELLs the opportunity to enroll in AP courses in order to offer them the  rigor of instruction that will enable them to be better prepared for post-secondary life. Also, LICHS offers a wide variety of  physical education "selectives" including swimming and gymnastics, as well as a great number of team sports, including  fencing, cricket, and soccer.  We have an extensive number of art and music electives open to all students including ELLs and  ELL-SWDs. In addtion, all ELLs have equal access to clubs and Extended Learning Time opportunities such as Breakfast and  Books, Lunch and Learn, and Saturday Academy.   Our CBO, Zone126 provided push-in emotional awareness drama work to  the ENL/ELA Dual Languages class through the EnACT program and CCNY mental health cllinic and Elmhurst Hospital clinic in  the school provide emotional support and health care for ELLs. One of our SPARKS program personnel offers an after school  support group for young men and several of our newcomers attend and receive emotional and social adaptive supports in  English and in Spanish. Additionally, 21st Century after school program incorporates ELLs in a drama program and other  afterschool activiities that include tutoring and socio-emotional support.In addition, Zone126 expanded their "Let's Get Ready"  SAT prep to serve all 11th graders across the school, including ELL students so that all students at LIC have access to quality  college readiness programs.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials aligned to the common core are utilized in every content area and supports for ELLs are included in the  form of supplemental audio and visual components as well as teacher created supports and technological supports for ELL  students in the Global Languages Academy. An iPad cart with 52 iPads was purchased in the 2015-16 instructional year to  improve instruction of ELLs and Elmo carts with LCD projectors have been placed in more and more classrooms this year. All  teachers in the Global Languages SLC have access to ELMO projectors, LCD projectors, laptop carts, MacBook carts, Lenovo  netbook carts, computer labs and audiovisual equipment. These are used in the ELL classroom on a regular basis with the  program Achieve3000.   The Milestones textbook series will be utilized in stand-alone Entering level ENL classes and has an  interactive technological component which requires the use of computers in the classroom. This same technology can be used  to support literacy in Spanish as a New Language or Home Language. HMH Collections materials in ELA include on-line  materials to enhance access through visuals and auditory language modalities while the Meaningful Math curriculum includes  manipulables to support access points for ENL students. LICHS also has content area libraires and glossaries in each classroom  and will renew Achieve3000 licenses to provide students with access to this program. In addtion, all ELLs have access to Castle  Learning, word for word dictionaries, bilingual dictionaries.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In the Dual Language program, there are 21 current students of which 20 are EPs.  There are two HLA classes for this program,  a grade 9 NLA and a grade 10 NLA course, both taught by Ms. Correa-Baer. These classes meet 5 days a week for 45 minutes  per day.  In the ENL only program, Spanish speakers are provided with a Spanish HLA class taught by Paulina Artime, Jesse  Mendoza, or Gabriel Alberti.  Advanced Placement Spanish Language and Literature are taught by Flor Carpio. There are 5  levels of Spanish in which students may be placed based on the Spanish LAB, an in-house assessment of Spanish literacy and  the ELE and LOTE scores for students.  The level one and two are for students with literacy issues in Spanish as measured by  the Spanish Lab and the school placement exam.  Level three is for students on grade level in Spanish. These students continue  on to AP Spanish Language and AP Spanish LIterature. Students who start out in the first two levels of HLA also have a chance  to take AP Spanish in their fourth year or earlier if they progress more rapidly.  Each year a periodic assessment is administered   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          99      to ensure proper placement of students occurs and to chart language progress. The in-house diagnostic is being revised by  Spanish/Native Language Arts teachers so that it is ready to use for the incoming 9th graders this school year. This assessment  will be translated into the several home langauges that are present in our school and will be piloted in ENL classes to assess  home language proficiency when the language is not English or Spanish.   All the teachers of ELLs received professional  development in “Translanguaging” from Associate Research Investigators from the CUNY Graduate School. and from the CUNY  NYSIEB School Ambassador and Peer Collaborative Teacher, Leonore Smith.  Teachers received intensive coaching on how to  use the students’ home language to support instruction. Teachers group students with “Translanguaging” theory in mind. In  the Freestanding ENL program, students have access to bilingual glossaries and bilingual dictionaries and can work with other  speakers of their home language in class. There will also be school-wide fine tuning of the SIOP model (Sheltered Instruciton  Observation Protocol) by Principal Selenikas during regular Wednesday departmental PDs and also during several planned  workshops throughout the school year. Depending on the population of the sheltered English content courses, additional  home language materials, such as classroom libraries and bilingual textbooks, are introduced as available and  appropriate.  Spanish-language texts are provided on a number of reading levels in science and social studies. In addition, the  Spanish NLA classes monitor reading and writing levels for students by utilizing Achieve3000.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Services are provided taking in consideration students’ English proficiency as mandated by CR Part 154. Due to budgetary  constraints, this academic year ELLs are in classes based on proficiency level and are not in grade level specific courses for  integrated ENL/ELA. LICHS has created grade band courses by proficiency and grade levels to ensure programming for ELLs is  aligned to common core grade bands, allowing students to be in age-appropriate classes. Curriculum for courses is not  modified using texts that are not age appropriate, but instead are modified through simplifying the lexile complexity of a text.  Translation services and the strategic employment of bilingual support staff, such as guidance counselors and parent  coordinators ensures that student services are age and grade level appropriate.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    In the past, technology in classrooms was specifically set aside for ELL classes within the Global Languages Academy. An iPad  cart with 52 iPads was purchased in 2015-16 to improve instruction of ELLs. In addition, with the school’s server upgrade,  LICHS will be able to utilize online language resources including DuoLingo, Rosetta Stone, and Genius as well as Castle Learning  and other online language support platforms. All teachers in the Global Languages SLC have access to ELMO projectors, LCD  projectors, laptop cart, a MacBook cart, a Lenovo netbook cart, and audiovisual equipment. Priority is placed on these visual  and audio enhancements being utilized for the common core aligned Collections curriculum in ELA and Meaningful Math in  Algebra and Geometry and more Elmos are to be in circulation in these classes in the 2017-18 school year. Reliable access to  technology is key to the implementation of the Achieve3000 reading proram in ELL stand-alone classrooms and technology or  computer labs should be made availbale on a regular basis so that teachers can plan to use the program with maximal impact,  at least two times per week.   The Milestones textbook series we will utilize for the Entering level stand-alone ENL classes has  an interactive technological component which requires the use of computers in the classroom as well.  RIGOR materials  including on-line materials and materials on a CD-ROM and Read Aloud books are incorporated into the CCLS argumentation  unit for ESL beginner and SIFE students. LICHS has content area libraires and glossaries in each classroom and will  renew  Achieve3000 licenses to provide each student with access to this program. In addtion, all ELLs have access to Castle  Learning, a content area support platform for Math, Sciences, and Social Studies, as well as word for word dictionaries, and  print and online bilingual glossaries.           16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   LICHS holds orientation sessions for incoming ELLs and their parents before the start of the school year. For the past four years  we provided a freshmen orientation and freshmen boot camp that allowed students to get a feeling of what high school life is  about at LICHS. Students took workshops on note-taking techniques and received tours of the school building and an overview  of all the programs and support systems at LICHS. Parents were briefed by the principal, Ms. Vivian Selenikas, on the state of  the school and engaged in a Q & A session. Translation in Spanish was provided by the Principal and translation via headsets  was available in Arabic and Bengali.  In the past year, over the counter students have been matched with a peer   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          100      ambassador/mentor who meets with the student to show them around the school, introduces them to support staff and  teachers and is an extra level of support as students transition into the NYC public school system. We held two events for  ambasadors and their mentees, one in the fall and one in the spring in order to check in on our new students. Staff involved  were the AP of Global Languages Academy, Maria Rodriguez, Peer Collaborative Teacher, Leonore Smith, Guidance Counselor  Cindy Orbegoso, ENL, NLA, and content teachers, Spanish Bilingual Family Outreach Coordinator Ismolli Cielo, and Arabic- speaking parent coordinator Mrs. Ibrahim. Depending on future funding availability, the school may also include a summer  bridge enrichment program to help transition ELLs into LICHS.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    If the student's native language is offered, we place the student in a native language course.  We encourage the student to  pass the Regents and Advanced Placement exams in his/her native language before studying an additional foreign  language.  Students, for whom we do not offer native language instruction, can choose from the foreign languages offered at  LICHS: Spanish, French and Italian. We also offer Greek and Chinese as language options.         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   The block programming of our Dual Language Spanish-English Program is in its third year of  implementation.  The model we initially aspired to was a 50-50 instructional allocation of language.  However, our initial cohort showed lower Spanish literacy on the in-house baseline assessment and a  majority came from non-Dual Language programs in middle school and lacked academic vocabulary in  Spanish. For this reason, the initial cohort began with a 70-30 distribution of English to Spanish and have  worked toward 50-50 allocation.  We currently have 21 EP in the program and 2 ELLs with 20 students  joining the 9th grade section this 2017-18 school year.  We are seeking to recruit ELLs from the over-the- counter and continuing students. All Dual Languages students are enrolled in an ENL/ELA class aligned to  the common core shifts and including ENL supports for ELLs as well as NLA classes. Fernando Villegas  taught the Dual Language CCSS Algebra in the 2015-16 school year, but as students transitioned into  Common Core Geometry, 9th and 10th  graders were assigned to double periods of DL math to ensure  success on their Regents exams. The 9th and 10th grade sections of NLA support will be taught by Krista  Correa-Baer, while the 11th grade DL students will move to AP Spanish Language and AP English  Language. To support the tranistion into AP coursework, students in Dual Language will continue in the  AVID program, to be taught in Spanish in order to complement and support the Spanish literacy levels  necessary for success in a rigorous college-bound program.  In reviewing the 8th grade ELA scores of  students in the dual langauge program, we found that most students entering the DL program scored a 1  or 2 on the 8th grade ELA exam.  Their Spanish Lab scores place the majority of Spanish dominant  students in the second quartile.  These students literacy levels are low in both langauges. This class uses  Achieve 3000 software to address literacy in both languages.  Ms. Correa-Baer is the HLA teacher and she  will use Achieve 3000 in her DL Spanish 9th and 10th grade courses to support non-fiction reading across  content areas.  The Achieve3000 program provides a monthly measure of students' individual progress in  reading in both English and Spanish.  In the DL program, emergent literacy is taught simultaneously in  both English and Spansh. Algebra, US History and Chemistry and health are taught as dual language  course with the curriculum divided into 50% Spanish and 50% English.  Students are also enrolled in some   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          101         classes taught wholly in English.  These are physical education, art, and ELA. The Spanish HLA class is  taught wholly in Spanish. Dual 9th and 10th graders were programmed into an ELT course for AVID- Advancement Via Individual Determination- a nationally recognized college preparatory curriculum that  supports study skills and deepens literacy skills for college level work. The program is a four year elective  course of study that can be taught in English or Spanish dependent on the needs of students within the  program.       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?    Our school's Small Learning Communities allow for a majority of the population of current ELL students and bilingual students  to be housed in an academy with two strands-Language, Media Arts and Technology and Language, Hospitality and Tourism.  This academy structure allows content and language support staff serving our ELL population to be programmed for periods of  common planning and academic inquiry. The Peer Collaborative Teacher for the Global Language Academy, Leonore Smith,  and other content and language support pedagogues deliver in-house professional development to content and language  teachers directly involved in the instruction of our ELL population. This in-house PD covers modifications to the explicit writing  instruction initiative, our emphasis on reading for content knowledge across content areas, academic vocabulary enrichment  strategies, as well as translanguaging skills as well as PD that deepens staff engagement in the inquiry cycle. The In-house PD is  supplemented by supports from external organizations and partnerships.  In addition, each Wednesday, there are school-wide  PD during the time set aside for teacher PD.  These PDs are used to support the school-wide literacy program promoted by the  Renewal Schools.  It is called WITSi and it focuses on langauge development through learning of language structures that  promote higher order thinking.  During the summer, teachers and administrators from the SLC will attend the SREB/High  Schools That Work summer conference, focusing on break-out sessions targeting ELL supports and strategies. These sessions  will be attended by ENL and content teachers of ELLs and ELL-SWDs. At the previous HSTW conference, teachers worked  together to create cross content unit plans on the theme of identity in order to allow students to transition into the academy  structure.  Guidance Counselors, bilingual teachers, ISS teachers and ENL teachers are all part of all school-wide PD.  Leonore  Smith, the ENL Peer Collboarative Teacher, is one of the teachers who is trained to turnkey WITSI and other initiaves. She  serves as a NYC School Ambassador for the CUNY New York State Initiative for Emergent Bilinguals (CUNY-NYSIEB) and works  to provide supports to teachers across the content areas as they modify curriculum and create lesson plans that support ELLs  in common core aligned units of study.  The school-wide literacy focus on "Writing to the task" has been expanded, upon  review of Regents and performance task data, to include a school-wide focus on annotation and reading with an empahsis for  ELLs on building foundations and expanding tier II and tier III vocabulary.  All teacher are part of the training that supports this  work in the classroom.  AP are trained by the Principal in frequent walkthroughs to look for evidence that ELLs, ISS and Gen Ed  students in all classes are participating in "writing to the task" activities.   Several pedagogues who support ENL students have attended the AVID Summer Institute Professional Development including  ENL teachers Leonore Smith and Chrisa Kenny. ENL teacher Wilfred Cameron will also be attending the AVID training this  summer. ELA teacher and ISS teacher Stella Cariagiorgis and Alison Gozzi have also received AVID training through attending  summer institutes and will be able to utliize these supports with ENL students as well as turnkey training to staff for extended  learning and enrichment activities for ELLs.  The Global Languages Academy Peer Collaborative Teacher, Ms. Smith, along with ISS teacher Seamus McCoy, BST Donna  Deluca, and English Teacher Paolo Javier also attended the High Schools That Work, SREB Summer Institute in Louisville,  Kentucky during the summer of 2016 and this staff shared strategies from these institutes with content and language staff at  the school through in-house PD. A team of teachers who work with ELLs and ELL-SWDs is scheduled to attend the HSTW  conference in Nashville, Tennessee this summer of 2017 and will continue to provide in-house PD in the coming school year to  refine our focus on literacy enrichment and achievement for ELLs. In addition to these professional development supports, LIC  is interested in participating in inter-visits with schools that are part of the DELLSS Dual Languages consortium for district 30.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          102      We have hosted three PDs for DELLSS in the 2016-17 school year and are interested in building relationships with other  Queens sites where similar populations of students are served.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    In order to meet our RSCEP goals and ensure that all students succeed and gain essential literacy skills, Pearson continues as a  provider of professional development for LIC. Our school leader has worked to ensure that the staff trainers Pearson provides  are their best national personnel. They are contracted to deliver professional development to support ongoing deepening of  the foundational SIOP practices begun at this school with a series of professional development supports around crafting  learning objectives and language objectives to focus instruction on the needs of students, and on building background for  students to provide access to content and language skills necessary for students. This coming school year, 2017-2018, SIOP  training will continue for the entire teaching staff, starting with a three-hour SIOP workshop on the third essential component,  assessment, as part of in-service training on the first day that teaching staff reports back to the building, September 5, 2017.  Ongoing and timely professional development on these three key features of instructional design will continue through the  school year on the designated professional development days: November 7th-Election Day, January 29th-Chancellor’s  Conference Day, and June 7th- Anniversary Day. SIOP will also be supported in house through departmental PD for ENL and ISS  pedagogues working to provide content push-in supports for ELLs and ELL-SWDs. For this ongoing component, the two teacher  teams will meet together for structured professional development supporting pedagogy around language acquisition and  language support informed by shared book study, SIOP methodologies, CUNY NYSIEB resources, and Writing Is Thinking skills  building approaches. The book study and professional development will occur during weekly departmental PDs. The structure  of the PD sessions will focus on the practices set forth in Yvonne S. Freeman and David E. Freeman’s Academic Language for  English Language Learners and Struggling Readers: How to Help Students Succeed Across Content Areas (2009). This ENL/ISS  department PD will be facilitated by principal Vivian Selenikas and Peer Collaborative Teacher for the Global Languages  Academy, Leonore Smith. The book study will begin with a focus on chapter 4, Coping with Academic Texts and Textbooks, to  encourage thinking and planning aligned to the SIOP precept of building the base. Subsequent sessions will focus on chapter 6,  Developing Academic Vocabulary and Writing Content and Language Objectives and chapter 5, Supporting Academic Writing at  the Paragraph and Sentence Levels. The session on learning objectives will be facilitated by Vivian Selenikas, who has extensive  training and background in the development of content and language objectives, while the session on sentence and paragraph  level writing skills will be facilitated by Leonore Smith, who has received three years of training with the Writing is Thinking  strategies for explicit teaching of sentence and paragraph level writing skills. Additional book study and PD will focus on  chapter 7, Teaching Academic Language and Subject-Area Content. To supplement PDs focused on language acquisition and  expansion strategies and practices to support ELLs through the resources provided by CUNY New York State Initiative for  Emergent Bilinguals (CUNY NYSIEB) will be infused into the PDs. The goal of this series of in-house PDs is to first support ELLs  through instruction that builds background and utilizes age and language level appropriate learning scaffolds and then to  support the gradual movement of students away from scaffolds and supports and toward greater and greater independent  mastery of language skills.  Professional Development Partnerships and Providers for the 2017-18 instructional year: We will continue to utilize our  partnership with SREB/HSTW to support the new NAF/CTE program residing in the Global Languages Academy, Informatics, as  well as consultant Pamela Broome who will continue to coach and support social studies as well as the ENL and English  departments in task development and language supports using the Literacy Design Collaborative (LDC) structures and  strategies.  The Office of Renewal Schools (ORS) will continue to support professional development at LIC through providing coaching for  our Rewards program teacher, Pia Debroy, and also providing coaching for the Math Department as they deepen their use of  the Thinking Through Math curriculum and alignments to EngageNY as well as coaching for our social studies department and  potential supports with adapting the New Visions curriculum to align to vocabulary and language acquisition needs of ELLs.  ORS also offers professional development in DataWise to deepen reflective and analytic practices around data. Strategically  selecting staff who can impact ELL programs and instruction is a prime consideration for the summer DataWise PD being  offered. This may entail identifying an ENL instructor and an AP who directly work with ELLs to attend, or including a Peer   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          103         Collaborative Teacher so that the training can be shared through the Small Learning Communities and can inform inquiry and  the use of data to drive instruction.  We continue our focus on adapting 9th grade curriculum to include key strategic features of the Writing is Thinking explicit  writing instruction program by working with the program’s developer, Nell Panero. The focus is on establishing practices that  support teachers in checks for understanding as well as sentence level and paragraph level writing skills.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?      The ENL Data and Assessment Coordinator, Fernando Villegas, coordinates information necessary to set up one meeting per  year for each ELL with ELL parents or guardians. In consultation with an assistant and the Global Languages guidance  counselor, Mr. Villegas creates an annual calendar to ensure that all ELL students have a meeting scheduled. Mrs. Mero, a  social worker for ISS who serves as a BST divides the number of meetings between herself and Mrs. Orbegoso, Global  Languages guidance counselor. Each conducts outreach to schedule meetings and notify all parties needing to attend. This may  include two or more teachers, APs of ENL/ELA or, if applicable, AP of ISS. Because meetings occur occoasionally after school or  on Saturdays, the school utilizes a teacher feedback form to relay information from content, ENL and NLA teachers regarding  student language progressions and identifying areas of focus. Guidance counselors ensure that a translator is provided either  in-house or from the Translation unit. An updated Annual Language Meeting form and necessary data is organized for the date  of the meeting to document the conversation. Guidance counselors complete the documentation and Mr. Villegas collects the  documents at the end of the meeting and files the information with other compliance documents kept for each ELL. The  meetings cover attendance, progress toward graduation, socio-emotional issues, and concerns raised by the parents. The AP  attending the meeting will bring issues raised in these meetings to cabinet when appropriate for further discussion and action  planning.    Mr. Villegas, ENL Data and Assessment Coordinator, scheduled 245 ENL Parent Annual Meetings. This means 100% of ELL  families were scheduled to meet with Cindy Orbegoso, Global Languages Academy guidance counselor who conducted and  documented the meetings. In the future, students and families will be counselled on student progress toward qualification for  the NY State Seal of Biliteracy during annual language conferences, since we have many students who could qualify but who  may not be aware of this distinction. For the maintenance of documentation and records, we may need to designate staff in  addition to guidance counsellors to assist with the process.         2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Parents of LICHS students, including parents of ELLs, are invited to the monthly Parent Association Meetings and interpretation  is provided through headsets purchased in the 2015-16 acedmic year and through our bilingual parent coordinators who speak  both Spanish and Arabic. Parents receive a quarterly newsletter created by the school's Parent Coordinators. The newsletter is  currently translated into Spanish, Bengali, and Arabic, our school's highest frequency languages other than English and is  distributed in print form and is also uploaded to the school web site. School events such as workshops, available tutoring,  report card distribution, college informational and financial aid sessions, and Parent Teacher Conferences are announced in  the parent newsletter. In addition, parents can view their children's performance and attendance on the online program  Skedula and Pupil Path, our new electronic grading platform which translates letters and communications into the  homelaguage of the parent. The parent coordinator provides parents with the Pupil path link and , access code, and password.  Parent coordiantor are availablefrom 8:00 am to 3:00 p.m. Monday to Friday in room 185. Freshmen parents received their  password at Freshmen Orientationa and other students received their password and their parents passwords when they  received their program cards on the day before school openned.We have hosted a celebration of our ELL students who have  moved to a commanding level of ENL for the past two years and have included parents in honors and award ceremonies by  altering the times that ceremonies occur so that more parents may attend. At all awards ceremonies, translation is available  via headsets and onhand staff. ELL parents have also participated in the annual language conferences and counsellors have      2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          104         used this opportunity to ensure that parents are receiving information in a language that is appropriate to their needs. In the  coming two academic years staff will also articulate to parents the pathways toward the NY State Seal of Biliteracy at annual  language conferences to raise student awarenedd and motivation to achieve this distinction on their diplomas.       Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Vivian Selenikas, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          106                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Long Island City High School                                                                              School DBN: 30Q450  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We used the ATS reports RHLA, RPOB and RAPL to determine the distribution of languages spoken by the parents  of our ELLs and of our total population. Parents fill out a "Blue Card" every year with contact information that  includes the preferred language of communication. This card is stored in the Nurse's office and used in case of  emergency. This information is collected by the pupil accounting secretary, Calo Downing, on intake and updated  regularly. All students have information entered. A copy of the report is sent to the Assistant princpals to share  with the departments and their Small Learning Communities.
