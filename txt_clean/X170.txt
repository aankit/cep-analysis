This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   School Vision   Section 4: CEP Overview      Our vision is to impart to our students a set of values, which will help them become critically thinking, conscientious  citizens that will contribute to society. We will achieve this by creating strong partnerships between staff, parents,  students, and community members to create a learning environment where all children can reach their full potential  academically, emotionally, socially, and physically.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      School Mission   Public School 170 functions on the belief that we are a community of lifelong learners. We are dedicated to providing  our school community with an educational environment that nurtures the whole child.    We commit ourselves to the development of a program of academic excellence, which challenges and develops the  student as an independent thinker and instills a love for learning.   We will strive to promote a rigorous learning environment, whereby each child reaches his/her potential and  develops their unique talents. Our curriculum embraces the understanding that a solid education must be founded on  secure mastery of basic skills, taught not only in isolation but also in an interdisciplinary, integrated manner.   We will provide an environment which embraces and honors our individual and cultural diversities. Public School 170  will provide opportunities for children to become productive and responsible citizens of the 21 st Century.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Respect For All School      Public School 170 has been designated as a Respect For All School two years in a row. We pride ourselves for  providing a warm, nurturing, and accepting environment where students feel safe to express themselves and learn.  Our message to families is that everyone is valued and treated in a respectful manner. We provided ongoing  professional development to teachers, students events, parents workshops, and family events to promote our belief  that at PS 170 We C.A.R.E. (Collaboration, Accountability, Respect, and Empathy.)       School Description   Public School 170, The Esteban Vicente Early Childhood School, is a kindergarten to second grade school with  approximately 258 students. There are twelve classes (four per grade): two monolingual classes, one monolingual ICT,  and one bilingual class. There are 21 teachers with 13 of them having seven years or more of teaching experience.       PS 170 is a caring and nurturing school, where students feel safe and supported. We believe that helping students  establish a positive self-image is crucial to their success. In addition to a rigorous academic program, all students  participate in music, dance, visual arts, and physical education during the school day. The Arts gives students the  opportunity to express themselves and find their hidden talents. Physical education not only provides physical activity  but also incorporates nutrition and teamwork.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Student success is celebrated via students work displayed throughout the school as well as a number of performances  throughout the school year. This allows students to develop a sense of pride and reinforces that their efforts are  valued.   We acknowledge the home school partnership as an essential tool to foster learning . At PS 170 we make an effort to  inspire parents to become active participants in their child’s education. This has resulted in a high percent of parental  involvement in school events. These include our Art Fair, students performances, and workshop which celebrate our  student’s achievements and give parents strategies to help their children at home. We have an open door policy  where parents are welcomed to visit the school and meet with administration and staff to discuss their child’s  education. Parents attend Open School Night, Parent Teacher conferences. and monthly Parent Association meetings.  School Leadership Team meetings are held to discuss and make decisions about the operations of the school and  upcoming events. A parent coordinator and school counselor are available to assist parents with any concerns. There  is ongoing communication between the principal, parent coordinator, and parent association. Bi-monthly profile  sheets are sent home to parents informing them of students’ goals and academic performance in their preferred  language.   We believe parents play an integral role in their children’s education. All information sent home is translated into the  students/parents’ preferred language. Translators are available for meetings if needed. It is obvious throughout the  building that cultures are respected and recognized through a broad range of extra-curricular activities including our  International Celebration. Parent Executive Board meetings are held on a monthly basis to discuss school related  issues. Administration is present at Parent Association meetings for question and answer sessions. Parents are also  part of the School Leadership Team that consists of an equal parent/teacher ratio. Parents attend a Town Hall  meeting and Open School Night, where they are informed of the curriculum, Common Core Learning Standards/Next  Generation Learning Standards, and safety procedures.    Student Engagement:   Student engagement continues to be at the core of our planning. We believe that students must be active participants  in the learning process with a rigorous curriculum. We have embedded interaction strategies (such as inner outer  circle, carousel, four corners) into our curriculum so students are engaged with the content, teacher, and peers.    Common Core Learning Standards   We continue to work with the CCLS by engaging closely with and examining school-wide implementation of the  Citywide Instructional Expectations in all content areas. Specifically, in literacy, social studies, and science where all  students are engaged in rigorous learning experiences that accelerate their learning, deepen their conceptual  understanding, and strengthen their ability to use textual evidence in reading, writing, and discussions. All students  are engaged in mathematics study, which includes fluency, application, and conceptual understanding. This year we  used the 5 Mathematical Practices which focus on problem solving and student discourse. A teacher team used  Monday professional development time to plan math exemplars around the 5 practices.    Professional Development   We believe that by giving teachers the appropriate tools and support, they can meet the academic needs of their  students thus providing them with a high quality education.    ● Professional learning is on-going. There are regular opportunities for teachers to plan together.    ● Inter-visitations are scheduled based on the needs of teachers. Instructional leads has been identified on each  grade. Preparation periods are arranged so teachers on a grade have the opportunity to meet and plan.   ● Common planning sessions are scheduled and used for planning and discussion of instruction.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      ● The ELL and Special Education liaisons, school counselor, parent coordinator attend professional development  provided by the Bronx Borough Field Support Center.   ● Summer planning- Teachers attend planning sessions with their peers; two days in literacy and two days in math.  The focus is revising units and aligning them with the CCLS, embedding language and content objectives,  opportunities for student interaction, and critical thinking. The dance and visual arts teachers also attends the  sessions, where they use Blueprints for Teaching and Learning in the ARTs.      ● Bilingual common planning has been scheduled once a week. The ELL Coordinator and bilingual teachers across the  grades met to develop units around grammar, which will impact student assessment in the NYSESLAT exam.   ● Bilingual planning- The ELL Coordinator and bilingual teachers created an outline for grammar aligned to the  common core standards. Questioning techniques were also embedded in the non-fiction and author study in  kindergarten.       Arts Education   The arts are vital to providing a well-rounded education to our children. It improves academic achievement, social  skills, encourages creativity, and develops self-esteem. We work closely with our Arts partner, Marquis Studio, to  provide art residencies in visual arts, percussion, circus, and puppetry.    We have also established a partnership with the Bronx Museum of Art. This year second grades students went on a  guided tour where they studied exhibits and then created art work based on that artist style. .    To further provide Arts education to our students, we allocate funds for full time in-house visual art and dance  teachers. In addition to our dance program, we have scheduled two ballet periods into our school day for selected  students who have demonstrated a talent in this area. The dance teacher coordinates auditions for students with  Ballet Tech. Some of our ballet students have gone on to various ballet programs. In the 2017-18 school year, three  students were accepted to Ballet Tech with scholarships.    Funds are also allocated for our art and drama after school program. The program meets one day a week and four  Saturdays a year. Students work on two performances throughout the school year. The Art and Drama performance  includes our first and second grade students. This year's performance was A Christmas Carol and The Little Mermaid.  Students’ displayed their amazing talents as they sang, danced, and acted in these performances.       Our visual arts teacher uses the Blueprints for Teaching and Learning in the ARTs. Our culminating activity is our Art  Fair. The exhibition is what you would find in a museum, where the beautiful art work of our students, Kindergarten  to second grade, is displayed. All students are given a tour of the exhibit. Parents are invited to view the exhibit during  open house. The visual arts teacher includes at least one piece for every student in the school.    We celebrate the multiculturalism of our school and learn about other communities during our International  Celebration. Students read and write non-fiction to learn about the country their class is studying. Along with the  academics, students also learn about the art, music, dance, customs, and people of the country. Guest speakers are  invited to speak to students and provide firsthand information about other countries. Students are given time to ask  questions. The celebration ends with all the classes performing for parents and other students during International  Week.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12          3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Special Populations   We have identified our ELLs as a subgroup with a special need. Through analyzing their writing pieces we have seen a  trend in their grammar usage. This year the bilingual teacher team began creating grammar units in both English and  their home language. By supporting their home language students will be able to transition into English. We will begin  to implement the units this coming school year.   When looking at SWD, we have identified the need to incorporate Specially Designed Instruction (SDI) when writing  the Present Levels of Performance in IEPs. We need to included students strengths, needs, and specific strategies that  work for individual students as well as areas of interest. This will be used by the general educations and special  education teachers when planning to meet the needs of students.        4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The elements of Framework for Great Schools that we have made the most progress are:   Rigorous instruction: We revised our math exemplars using the 5 Mathematical practices. The kindergarten and first  grade team analyzed student work and identified areas of strength and next steps. The teachers identified the need  for student to use mathematical vocabulary when explaining their thinking and math congress. This became one of  the foci for the lessons.    Supportive Environment: This year we trained six staff members in Therapeutic Crisis Intervention in Schools. (TCIS).  Staff members used strategies to de-escalate crisis situations during the school year, reducing the number of  discipline code violations in OORS.    Strong Family and Community Ties: We were very pleased with the continued participation of parents in school  activities. .   Collaborative Teachers:: Using teacher rounds, two teacher teams conducted 3 rounds with the focus of student  discussion. As per teacher post observation conferences, staff has stated that they will embed strategies observed  during rounds in there lessons.    Our Key focus areas for next year are:   Effective Leadership: After looking at compliance data a focus will be placed on monitoring initial referrals, annual and  tri-annual reviews assuring that the process in completed within the mandated time requirements.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 09X170   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   263   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Through Advance SY 2018 teacher observations, the trend has been that students need to engage more with text  during independent reading. Teacher observations have also revealed that during independent reading their is limited  student discussion. During post observation teacher conferences, teachers received feedback to implement  strategies., such as students being able highlight text evidence with a post-it, using a turn and talk to share evidence  with a partner, and in some classrooms we have started partner reading where students share text evidence with a  partner.,   This coming school year we want to assure that all students are engaged as they read independently as well as  increase stamina and comprehension,. We will begin to incorporate partner reading along with independent reading  thus increasing student engagement student comprehension, and raising the level of student discussions that occur  during the reading block.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

High expectations are also communicated to parents through:   ● Kindergarten Orientation   ● Parent Association Meeting   ● School Leadership Team Meeting   ● Town Hall Meeting   ● 40 Tuesday Parent Involvement Time   ● Parent Workshops    ● Bi-weekly Profile Sheet   ● Parent Teacher Conferences   ● Open School Night   ● School Based Support Team   ● Promotion In Doubt Meetings   ● Open Door Policy   ● ELL Orientation   Family Night Events   Individual Parent Meetings   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      Classroom End of Unit Shares    The impact of communicating high expectations to parents is evident in their commitment to support their child’s  learning at home as evidenced in homework, comments on profile sheets, attendance at Parent Teacher Conferences,  and attendance at workshops, and classroom events.    We noticed that parent involvement decreased as students enter second grade. To address this concern, we surveyed  second grade parents and the data showed that they would attend if events were held in the evening. To address  their needs, we held our second grade Brotherhood Performance in the evening the past two years and second grade  parent attendance was 97%.       Feedback from the school counselor, parent coordinator, and teachers have shown a need for parenting classes. This  year we had a number of families that were struggling supporting their children emotionally as well as academically.  There is a need for parents to establish routines and behavior management strategies at home to co-exist with school  strategies.

We have  42  students  who are in  shelters  or  doubled  up.      2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population.   When a student arrives the principal meets with the parent and student and welcomes them to our school. The  school supplies the materials the students will need so the parent does not need to purchase school supplies. The  school has a uniform policy and a discount coupon is given to the parent. STH funds were used to purchase uniforms  and book bags for students If there is a financial hardship.   Once the student is registered the parent and child are introduced to the child's teacher and the school counselor. If  the parent feels the student needs additional support, the parent can write a letter stating that he/she would like the  child to receive at-risk counseling to support the child with getting accustomed to the new school.   When the child is assessed, if there is a need for academic support, the child may receive RTI Tier Ii services and/or  attend our after school programs.   We provide a safe and welcoming environment so that both the parent and child are made to feel welcomed and part  of the school community.      Part B: FOR NON-TITLE I SCHOOLS   1.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Strategies to recruit highly qualified teachers:    In order to attract highly qualified teachers the principal attended job fairs organized by the District. Teacher  qualification begins with an interview with the principal. The principal then schedules a follow-up interview and  demonstration lesson with the new hire and members of the school community. At this meeting the staff shares the  school's philosophy and educational expectations with the candidate. Questions are asked to evaluate teacher  competency. The potential new hire conducts a demonstration lesson which is observed by the principal,  administrative assistant, and classroom teacher. The team provides feedback to the teacher. The observation must  result in an effective rating. The Principal makes the final decision.   Strategies for teacher retention:    We have a high staff retention rate. We believe this is so because of all of the systems we have in place to support the  professional growth of teachers.   These include:   ● Teachers are scheduled for inter-visitations to see best practices in action.   ● Teachers are part of teacher rounds   ● Teachers have the opportunity to attend professional development of their choice or assigned by principal  presented by Bronx Borough Field Support Center, DOE, and consultants.   ● Articulation between principal and instructional leads are focused on meeting teachers’ needs.   ● Activities for Professional Development Days are planned to meet teacher needs.   ● Weekly common planning and Monday professional learning periods provide the opportunity to analyze student  work, plan and discuss strategies for instruction.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      ● Experienced teachers are assigned as buddy teachers for new teachers to build teacher professional knowledge   ● Professional development days are scheduled throughout the school year to plan literacy and math units with a  focus on student engagement, critical thinking and rigorous learning tasks.   ● Weekly common planning provides opportunities to plan and discuss strategies for instruction.   ● A Mentor is assigned to new teachers   * The Model Teacher with support teachers in the areas of student discussion and peer feedback.       Instruction by highly qualified staff    ● Teachers with three or more years teaching experience will work with holdovers   ● Teachers are familiar with fundamental aspects of reading and literacy   ● Teachers maintain a professional support network and possess professional will   ● Teachers participate in long-term professional development concentrating on the Common Core Learning Standards  and best practices   ● Teachers are supplied with materials to support the learning process   ● Teachers have the ability to relate and keep an open line of communication between school and home   ● Teachers will immerse ELL students in the English language through intensive small group and individual instruction  using ENL and SIOP strategies   ● Teachers will have background knowledge in technology to improve reading and writing skills        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   • Professional development will be provided to teachers in order to deepen their understanding of the CCLS and Next  Generation Standards, and the shifts that need to occur to promote critical thinking. They will work together with lead  teachers to develop standard based units of study in literacy, math, science, and social studies.   • Teachers will receive support with the analysis of data and goal setting.   • Teachers will continue to receive professional development in order to deepen their knowledge of the CCLS, critical  thinking, and Specially Designed Instruction.    • Professional Development will continue to focus on building academic language of our students through the use of  the SIOP model, content and language objective, and tiered vocabulary.   • Teachers will create individual professional goals with an action plan.

To assist pre-school student’s transition into kindergarten, we provide kindergarten orientation workshops for  parents. Two sessions are scheduled in May. Parents are presented with the curriculum, policies and expectations of  the school. Parents are made aware of what their children should know by the time they enter kindergarten as well as  activities they can do to prepare their children for school.   We share our building with Highbridge. Daycare. There is ongoing communication between the principal and director  of the daycare. In order to ease the transition of preschool students into public schools, we schedule pre K students to  visit our school. Pre-K students join our kindergarten classes. Our kindergarten students give the pre-K students a tour  of the classroom and read a story to them.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     We are implementing the assessments for Measurement of Student Learning MOSL. In September, the principal  meets with the MOSL team and presents the information to the staff. After the meeting the MOSL team meets and  selects the assessment to be used for the local and state measures. This information is shared and discussed with the  entire staff so that everyone is clear as to what assessments are being used.    MOSL baselines are administered and the data is entered into Schoolnet. Teachers are aware of the target CCLS  standards assessed through the MOSL. These standards are embedded in our units of study in the area of reading,  writing, and math.   In the area of math, unit pre and post tests are created by classroom teachers focusing on the standards that are  taught in the unit. Formative assessments are used as a mid-unit checkpoint.    This year we used the 5 Mathematical Practices to plan our math exemplars. Math Exemplars are analyzed to identify  next steps. to assess math standards in context. These are used to inform instruction and/or monitor progress of  students. Our CCLS units include initial tasks, formative assessments and performance tasks, that demonstrate the  acquisition of the content and mathematical practices necessary to meet the math CCLS. These tasks have been  created, studied, and teachers have come to a consensus of their administration. The exams are part of the unit  overview and are included in our pacing calendar. During common planning, we look at these assessments and tasks  to monitor student progress and make modifications to our lesson plans. Data of pre and post unit tests are collected  via our tracking sheets.   Reading is assessed through running records. Benchmark reading levels have been established for all grades. Students  are instructed in reading through guided reading. New teachers have been provided with training in the  implementation and analysis of running records. Running records are used to monitor student progress in the area of  reading. This year we looked at student progress in reading more frequently, identified at-risk students and used LLI  to support students who needed additional support. This year our ELLs made progress as opposed to last year.  However, we still noticed a trend with our SWD, they made progress but some were still not on grade level.    In writing, students are assessed based on their writing in specific genres. Each writing unit has either checklists or  rubrics. Rubrics and checklists have been revised for strong alignment to the CCLS. Students are also monitored  throughout the unit through conferencing and teacher observation. Students self-monitor with checklists and rubrics.  During common planning, teachers share student work. The work is analyzed using our established protocol,  strengths are identified and next steps are established for each level. This is also part of the MOSL for state  assessment for teacher rating 20%.    Benchmark assessment in the areas of reading and writing are administered three times a year, September,  January/February, and May. This is all documented in our pacing calendars, assessment calendars, and tracking  sheets.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50           Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 09X170, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.        The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       Public School 170 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

These assessments monitor  student progress and yearly growth. The results of these assessments are used to plan instruction  for students and to identify individual goals. Students' strengths and next steps are identified.  Engaging activities are planned to meet their needs in English and in their home  language.  Students’ home language is used to scaffold their learning. This will help transfer  skills and concepts to the English language.    English Language Learners tend to fall below the benchmark in the areas of reading and writing  in English as assessed by running records (English and Spanish) and writing pieces.  In order to accommodate the needs of our ELL’s we offer an ENL and Home Language After  School Program.  The following is the program schedule for the ENL and Home Language After school Program-  -Start and End Date for both programs: October 17 ,2018 - May 30 , 2019  -Total number of sessions for both programs: 56 sessions  -Time of Operation for both programs: Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:40 pm-4:10 pm  -Number of Teachers: Two teachers are bilingual certified and one teacher is bilingual and  TESOL certified.  -Title 1 SWP or Tax Levy Fair Student Funding will be used to supplement the cost of this  program.  Research shows that ELL student achievement lags behind non-ELL student achievement at all  socioeconomic levels. To understand and close this achievement gap a multifaceted approach is  required in supporting ELLs in school and beyond the school day. Our school is determined to  support the linguistic, cultural, emotional and academic needs of our students who are learning  English as an additional language. Helping students improve their English supports their success  in school.   ENL Program:  First and second grade ENL and bilingual students participate in learning experiences that  enhance the development of the English language. The Program consists of bilingual and ENL  students that are at the Entering, Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding levels of the English  language.  ELLs at the Entering/Emerging levels of proficiency use the Core Knowledge  program, specifically focusing on the skills strand component of the program. SIOP strategies  are embedded in the instruction. The SIOP framework is a researched based model of sheltered  instruction that helps our teachers plan and deliver lessons that allow our ELLs to acquire  academic knowledge as they develop English proficiency. Transitioning/Expanding ELL  students  use the Core Knowledge program, specifically focusing on the Listening and Learning  strand as well as a technology component using the i-Ready program. Both groups also focus on  grammar and language structure. Focus is mainly on complexity of language, quality of language  and mechanics. The ENL After school Program will run from October 17, 2018 to May 30, 2019.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   The program will run on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:40pm-4:10pm. The language of  instruction is English with home language support if needed. Two bilingual certified teachers  will take part in the program.    Home Language Program:   Research shows that the home language is of considerable benefit to the overall academic  success of ELLs. If students have a solid foundation in their home language they are able to  transfer many skills and knowledge from their first language to the acquisition of the new  language.   Our bilingual classes service many newcomers that do not come with a solid foundation in their  home language. After analyzing their Word Work Assessment, Fountas and Pinell and the  Writing baseline in Spanish, the bilingual team decide who would benefit of the additional  support.  La Cartilla program from Santillana USA is used for this after school program. This  comprehensive phonics program supports Spanish literacy development with phonemic  awareness, phonics, and vocabulary development. Part of the program also focuses on grammar  and sentence structure. The Home Language program will run from October 17, 2018 to May 30,  2019. The program will run on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:40pm - 4:10pm. The  language of instruction is Spanish. One bilingual certified teacher will take part in the Home  Language program.  A binder is kept in the office with the students attendance including a copy of the program  notification in the parents' preferred language.

City wide professional  development days (November 6, 2018 and June 6, 2019) will be utilized for teachers to be part of  different professional learning opportunities for their enhancement of content knowledge and  pedagogical skill. These professional learning sessions will include Special Design  Instruction,The Next Generation Learning Standards, and Question Formulation Technique  (QFT) given by a consultant.These PDs will help our teachers look at the school's curriculum  with a broader lens. In turn this will help our ELLs work independently and collaboratively with  peers and adults to produce texts and to develop their oral-written language and reading-writing  connections.  These sessions is at no cost to the Title III program.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         Part C: Professional Development     Mathematics:  Deep conceptual understanding of mathematics is crucial to prepare our students for the  future.  We will continue our work with the 5 Mathematical Practices. Our teachers will continue  to create discussion-based opportunities for student learning and support their students as they  engage with mathematical ideas.    Common grade preps, from 9:05 am - 9:50am and UFT professional learning time, from 2:40- 4:00pm  is used to analyze student work, analyze data, and make instructional decisions. This is  done with the principal,instructional leaders, ELL Coordinator, and teachers. Teachers also use  the UFT professional learning sessions  for Teacher Rounds and continued work with the 5  mathematical practices.    In the Fall, teachers received a copy of the NYSESLAT scores and identify student needs and  proficiency levels with the aide of the ELL Coordinator. During planning sessions with grade  leaders and principal, strategies are shared by our bilingual and ENL teachers within the four  modalities. Teachers  use this data and strategies to address the needs of individual students.  A  bilingual teacher team, led by the ENL/bilingual coordinator, analyze the NYSESLAT using the  EDAT( ELL Data Analysis Tool). From this tool a data report is created to aide teachers in  planning and drive instruction within the four modalities. Bilingual teachers have their own  common planning time to continue work on Word Work and grammar components of the  curriculum.  Our principal, Ms. Sonia Acevedo Suarez, keeps a record of each PD in her office with  attendance, agendas, and schedule.

We make an effort to inspire parents to become  involved in their child's education.  This has resulted in a high percentage of parental  involvement in all school events.  An example of this is the performances throughout the school  year, which many parents attend to celebrate student work.  We have an open door policy, where  parents feel free to visit the school and meet with administration and staff to discuss their  children's education.  Parents attend "Open School Night,"  Parent Teacher  Conferences,  Monthly Parent Association Meetings, and Town Hall Meetings. These meetings  are scheduled to keep parents informed about the operation of the school and upcoming  events.  The parent coordinator, who is bilingual, is available to assist parents with any  concerns.  There is ongoing communication between the principal and parent coordinator.  Bi- Weekly Profile sheets are sent home to parents informing them of students goals and academic  performance in reading, writing, math, completion of homework and social skills.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61   Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    School leaders are in a unique position to create a culture of success within their school  community. As with other students, an important aspect of ELL success is family engagement.  Engaged ELL parents bring invaluable dedication and wisdom regarding their children to the  school community and can be crucial partners in supporting their children’s success. To involve  ELL parents in their children’s education our school will be offering workshops on parenting  skills which include the parents' roles in children's literacy development. Consultants will  provide these workshops for parents. It is projected that two workshops will be held by February  2019.  A binder will be kept in the office that include attendance, agendas, resources and invitations in  the parents' preferred languages.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?       Using data in instructional decisions can lead to improved student performance .The more information we have about our  students, the clearer picture we have about their achievement and can identify their needs and next steps.  Our ELL students  are assessed through EL SOL (bilingual classes), ECLAS 2, Fountas and Pinnell (English and Spanish in bilingual  classes),  baseline/mid line/ end line writing tasks, math writing tasks, guided reading/ anecdotals, i-Ready and discussion  protocols. These formative assessments monitor student progress, yearly growth, and are used to identify individual goals.  After analyzing assessments- students' strengths, needs and their next steps are identified and activities are planned to meet  the needs of our English Language Learners in English and in their home language to scaffold their learning.This helps them  transfer skills and concepts in the English language. The results of these assessments are used to plan Tier 1 instruction for  students.  It enables teachers to make adjustments to their individual lesson plans to meet the varied needs of their students.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      We want all of our students, including ELLs,  to become critical thinkers, good communicators, good collaborators and problem  solvers. Using formative and curriculum embedded assessment data,  teachers have been able to make students more active  in acquiring knowledge and skills.  Teachers have been able to create opportunities for collaborative learning and interaction  by using discussion protocols and visuals.  The Frayer model has been used more consistently in acquiring academic language  needed to understand content.      Our data has also led teachers to adjust pacing for the whole class or scaffold for those students who are still struggling by  using the SIOP framework. Our data shows that our ELL students are progressing in L2.  The data also shows that most of our  students make a year's progress in both English and Spanish for both reading and writing.  It also informs us who are our  students at-risk and who would benefit from our after school programs or RTI.     Our ELL data    Note: At the end of the year, percentages will be reflected on our LAP to show growth during the year and to see how many  students obtained benchmark levels for L1 and L2.

What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We have various professional learning sessions to ensure that we are targeting every proficiency level and where expectations  are explicitly discussed and embedded into our curriculum. These include:  ● Teacher teams- curriculum teams, grade teams, bilingual teams, content teacher teams - Teachers meet every week to  discuss curriculum, analyze assessments to identify students’ strengths, needs, and next steps. Teachers also discuss best  practices and strategies that work in their classrooms.  ● Monday  and full day Professional Development - Professional learning is ongoing. There are regular opportunities for  teachers to plan together. Professional learning in math and literacy are scheduled throughout the school year. The teachers  spend a full day revising curriculum based on the needs of the students with the focus of ensuring alignment with the CCLS,  embedding SIOP components such as language and content objectives, student interaction and critical thinking, and that there  is vertical and horizontal alignment between grades. Two professional development sessions focused on critical thinking/  higher order questioning were given by LCI (Learning Centered Initiatives). For the 2017-2018 year teacher rounds teams will  meet to plan lessons that will be observed by other teachers as well as the debriefing.  ● Learning walks and inter-visitations -Inter-visitations are scheduled based on the needs of teachers. A grade leader has been  identified on each grade. Prep periods are arranged so teachers on a grade have the opportunity to meet and plan, including  the bilingual team. Calendar changes are scheduled for professional development. Common planning sessions are scheduled  and used for planning and discussion on instruction. The ELL and Special education coordinators attend professional  development provided by  DELLS.  ● Summer planning- Teachers attend planning sessions with their peers. The focus is revising literacy and math units of study  and align them with the CCLS and ELL Blueprint. This summer, there will also be a bilingual session to continue to align  curriculum to CCLS/Home language progressions as well as the new language and the focus will be on writing for our ELLs.  ● DELLSS- On going support and guidance through PD's and resources.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our K-2 students are are assessed through MOSL, NYSESLAT, baseline/mid line/end line writing, baseline/mid line/end line  math assessment( English or Spanish),  unit math assessments and Fountas and Pinnell running records ( in English and  Spanish). The results of these assessments are used to plan instruction for student progress and yearly growth and identify  individual goals. During common planning teachers analyze these assessments and next steps are identified and used for  individual goals.

We look to see how  much growth our ELL students make from year to year in reading, writing and math.  NYSESLAT data shows  that most of our  students are progressing and moving up a proficiency level every year. There are some students who have stayed in the  Expanding level for two consecutive years. We see this trend in our second grade bilingual class. Looking closer at the 4  modalities we see that students that have stayed in the same level do not progress in the writing modality of the NYSESLAT.  We have identified that area as an area of need. In the following months our bilingual team will meet and will discuss  strategies that can be use in writing such as in grammar, sentence structure and writing genres.  We will continue to look back  at our grade curricula and modify them to meet the needs of our ELLs.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The results of formative and summative assessments are used to plan instruction for student progress, yearly growth and  identifying individual goals. During common planning teachers  analyze these assessments and next steps are identified and  used for individual goals. After analyzing the data, teachers then identify at-risk students.  Teachers plan Tier 1 instruction for  their at-risk students. Teachers also identify at-risk students who would benefit from intervention services such as RTI and/or  ENL and Home language after school programs. In order to accommodate the needs of our ELLs we offer ENL and Home  Language After School Programs.    Research shows that ELL student achievement lags behind non-ELL student achievement at all socioeconomic levels. In order  to understand and close this achievement gap a multifaceted approach is required in supporting ELLs in school and beyond the  school day. Our school is determined to support the linguistic, cultural and academic needs of the students who are learning  English as an additional language. Helping students improve their English supports their success in school. First and second  grade ENL and bilingual students participate in learning experiences that enhance the development of the English language.  The ENL After school Program consists of bilingual and ENL students that are at the Entering, Emerging, Transitioning and  Expanding levels of the English language. ELLs at the Entering/Emerging levels of proficiency use the Core Knowledge program,  specifically focusing on the skills strand component of the program. SIOP strategies are embedded in the instruction. The SIOP  framework is a researched based model of sheltered instruction that helps our teachers plan and deliver lessons that allow our  ELLs to acquire academic knowledge as they develop English proficiency. Transitioning ELL students use the Cookshop program  and SIOP model. The CookShop Program is a science content- based program that uses hands-on exploration, cooking and  physical activities to foster children’s enjoyment and consumption of healthy food and their appreciation for good nutrition.  Students learn where food comes from and how it grows. All CookShop Classroom teachers receive comprehensive, interactive  training and support from Food Bank staff, as well as all of the curriculum materials, food, supplies and equipment needed to  implement the program Expanding level students use the Core Knowledge program, specifically focusing on the Listening and  Learning strand as well as a technology component using the i-Ready program.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   All students, including ELLs are given ECLAS-2 as a pre-screener. An RTI criteria chart was created in order to identify  candidates for RTI. Students who fall within the TIER 2 and TIER 3 criteria are then given PALS, a more thorough screener to  identify the specific areas of need. Based on the PALS score, students are specified as either Tier 2 or Tier 3 on the RTI  spectrum. We use the PALS framework in conjunction with SIOP and other ENL strategies to enhance specific instructional  plans for these students. ELL students are progressed monitored every six to ten weeks. The PALS quick checks(progress  monitoring) are used to determine the focus, intensity and duration of the intervention. Scores for the quick check(progress  monitoring) are entered in the PALS on the online score entry and reporting system. Quick checks (progress monitoring) are  administered between screening windows to students who need more instruction in a specific skill and that do not need the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71      benchmark for PALS. During common planning teachers and RTI teacher discuss strategies that would benefit these students.  In September 2017 RTI teacher, ELL coordinator, principal and SWD coordinator will revisit the process for  RTI.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].      Establishing rigorous monitoring systems allows to monitor ELLs’ progress over time, determine when students are not making  appropriate progress, and provide additional support to enable ELLs to reach English proficiency and gain grade level content  knowledge. Student achievement is our goal at PS 170. We evaluate the success of our ELL programs through data analysis.  The NYSESLAT results help us identify trends and the progress that our ELLs are making from kindergarten to second grade. We  identify students that stay on the same proficiency level for two consecutive years and teachers discuss strategies that they  can used with these students. We also identify students who digress in proficiency levels. We look at other assessments as well  to see any trends.  English language learners are assessed in their home language as well as in their new language. Students in bilingual classes  are assessed using EL SOL and Fountas and Pinnell running records in the home language and the new language and ECLAS-2.  Writing baseline/mid line and end lines are given in both Spanish and English. Math assessments are also given in Spanish or  English depending on the students' NYSESLAT proficiency level. These assessments are analyzed in both languages. All data is  collected and input into the PS 170 tracking system. This online tracking system monitors students' progress throughout the  year. The results of these assessments are used to identify school wide weaknesses, create school goals, conduct observations,  provide professional development, create lab-sites, schedule inter-visitation, plan instruction and purchase materials. At the  end of the year the bilingual team meets and discusses the progress that our ELLs have made throughout  the year. We analyze  the academic growth and possible holdovers and evidence of what has been done for students. We discuss the  academic/social emotional aspects and any other concerns teachers might have about students.      Our ELL data shows that most of our ELLs show progress from kindergarten to second grade.

What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   A list of our ELLs and their proficiency levels are given to all teachers in September. Teachers are given data on their ELL  students which includes proficiency level, modality breakdown, reading level,  writing level and any social/emotional aspect of  the students. This data gives teachers a better idea on how to plan for Tier 1 instruction. The data also gives teachers  information on which students would benefit from after school programs in  ENL or Home language. The EDAT tool will also be  used to support with planning, instruction and programming. Our NYSESLAT data shows that our ELLs are making progress in  the acquisition of the English language including our ELLs with special needs. The data also shows that even though they are  moving up in proficiency levels, when we looked at trends, the modality that students keep getting a lower score is for the  writing modality. During our 2017 summer planning our bilingual team met and focused on best practices for writing. For the  2017-2018 school year, teachers will be focusing on strategies/activities that will support our ELLs to improve their writing. Will  focus on embedding different types of writing for each unit and focusing on grammar and sentence structure. Teachers will  look at the present curriculum and plan for vertical and horizontal alignment.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Successful ELL programs must  be designed to enable ELL students to attain both English proficiency and equal  participation in the standard instructional program, comparable to their monolingual peers, within a reasonable  period of time. Research shows that effective academic programs for ELLs eliminate achievement gaps by providing  cohesive, sustained systems of support. PS 170x has a K-2 TBE and ENL programs.    The ENL Program at PS 170x is instructed in English with support in their native language to the extent possible. It  incorporates the four modalities of listening, speaking, reading and writing in content area and English language  development instruction. The focus is on basic skills needed to communicate in everyday situations (BICS) as well as  placing a strong emphasis in acquiring academic language (CALP). The ENL program is based on the New Language  Progressions (NLAP) anchored to the Common Core Standards for foundational skills, language, reading and writing.  The ENL program provides support to the school's curriculum and curriculum from EngageNY.   A strong emphasis is  given to an increase in academic language to meet or exceed the standards. The SIOP framework is used to give that  language/academic support. The grouping of ELLs is based on grade level, NYSESLAT scores, and IEP goals. Our ENL  students are assessed through formative and summative assessments. Anecdotals are systematically taken to help  monitor and address any concerns strengths, needs and next steps. The ENL teacher works in collaboration with  classroom teachers to meet the needs of all ELL students. Our ENL students receive a certain amount of periods of  ENL a week based on their NYSESLAT proficiency levels.    The ENL teacher,who is dually certified,  services all kindergarten, first and second grade students mandated to  receive ENL services in the monolingual setting. All ENL students are grouped according to proficiency level and  receive the mandated number of minutes as per CR Part 154. The ENL/ELL program consists of Integrated ENL and  standalone ENL. Many of the students are grouped by proficiency level and grade. Entering and emerging students are  grouped together as well.        Entering ENL students: 1 unit of study in stand-alone ENL and 1unit of study in integrated ENL/ELA                            Emerging ENL students: 1 unit of stand-alone ENL and 1unit integrated ENL  Transitioning ENL students: .5 unit in ENL and .5 unit in integrated ENL  Expanding: 1 unit of study od integrated ENL/ELA/Content Area  Commanding: .5 Integrated ENL     * 1 unit of study: 180 minutes     Entering/Emerging/Transitioning levels (2 periods a day/4 days-360 minutes a week)  Expanding(1 period a day/4 days- 180 minutes a week)  Commanding (2 periods a week-90 minutes)      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     PS 170x has a K-2 Transitional Bilingual Program. The language of instruction is Spanish and English. There is one  bilingual class on each grade. Our focus is on supporting our bilingual students as they acquire content knowledge  while progressing towards English proficiency. The Bilingual program Curriculum is based on the Home and New   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77         language progressions anchored to the Common Core Standards. It incorporates the four modalities of listening,  speaking, reading and writing in the home and new language. Teachers collaborate to promote academic  achievement in all content areas. Strong emphasis is given to an increase in academic language to meet or exceed the  standards. The SIOP framework is used to give that language/academic support in the home and new languages. The  content areas taught in HLA in the TBE program are math, reading and writing. Our bilingual students are assessed  through EL SOL, ECLAS 2, Fountas and Pinnell (English and Spanish), baseline/mid line, end line writing, as well as unit  math tests. These assessments monitor student progress, yearly growth, and are used to identify individual goals. It  enables teachers to make adjustments to their individual lesson plans to meet the varied needs of their students. The  results of these assessments are used to plan instruction for students. After analyzing assessments students' strengths  and weaknesses are identified and activities are planned to meet the needs in English and their native language.  Students' native language is used to scaffold their learning. This helps them transfer skills and concepts in the English  language.           Per CR Part 154-2 (K-8) Transitional Bilingual Education program, entering and emerging students receive 1 unit of  study of stand alone ENL and 1 unit of study of integrated ENL/ELA. For transitional and Expanding levels there is  1  unit of integrated ENL. Students are grouped by proficiency levels.       c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Teachers create program cards in September with the ELL Coordinator's assistance. Program cards are reviewed to ensure  students are receiving the mandated number of instructional minutes. The principal keeps a copy of all program cards in the  main office. These cards are used during a Principal's observation of a Bilingual/ ENL Teacher. All monolingual classroom  teachers, bilingual classroom teachers, cluster/ENL teachers, paraprofessionals, coaches and Principal receive copies of  NYSESLAT/ NYSITELL results and proficiency levels in September to plan for instruction and observations.    How are explicit ENL, ELA, HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model ?    Students who are in the Entering level receive the following ENL minutes:    Entering ENL students: 1 unit of study in stand-alone ENL and 1 unit of study in integrated ENL/ELA  Emerging ENL students: 1 unit of stand-alone ENL and 1 unit integrated ENL  Transitioning ENL students: .5 unit in ENL and .5 unit in integrated ENL  Expanding: 1 unit of study od integrated ENL/ELA/Content Area  Commanding: .5 Integrated ENL  * 1 unit of study: 180 minutes    Bilingual students receive the required amount of Native Language Arts and ENL time based on their English language  proficiency. A minimum of 360 minutes of ENL activities on a weekly basis is provided to students who scored an entering or  emerging level of English Proficiency. This includes 180 minutes of ENL and 180 minutes of English language arts within the  literacy program. Teachers create program cards in September with the Bilingual Coordinator's assistance. Program cards are  reviewed to ensure students are receiving the mandated number of instructional minutes. The principal keeps a copy of all  program cards in the main office. These cards are used during a Principal's observation of a Bilingual/ENL Teacher. All  monolingual classroom teachers, bilingual classroom teachers, cluster/ENL teachers, paraprofessionals, coaches and Principal  receive copies of NYSESLAT/ NYSITELL results and proficiency levels in September to plan for instruction and observation.  Students who are in the Entering and Emerging levels receive in bilingual classes:     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78      Reader’s Workshop 45 (HLA)  Writer’s Workshop 40 (HLA)  Word Work 45  (ENL )  Independent Reading 20 (HLA)  Morning Routines 45 (ENL)  Math Workshop 60 (HLA)  Read Aloud 10 (HLA)  Read Aloud 20 (ENL)  ( Science/Social Studies ) (45) (ENL)  Dance/Music  45 ( In English)    Students who are in the Transitioning and Expanding levels receive in bilingual classes:    Reader’s Workshop 45 (HLA)  Reader’s Workshop 45 (ELA)  Writer’s Workshop 45 (ELA)  Writer’s Workshop 45 (ENL)  Word Work 45 (ELA)  Word Work  45 (HLA)  Morning Routines 45(ENL)  Math Workshop 45 (HLA)  Read Aloud 30 (ELA)  Read Aloud 20 (ENL)  Science/Social Studies 45 (ELA)  Dance/Music 45 (Eng.)                3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      We are continuing to align our units of study with the CCLS as well as aligning our units of study vertically and horizontally  across grades to ensure that our students are meeting the standards when they leave our school. These alignments are for  both monolingual and bilingual settings. Using the balanced literacy approach and SIOP framework and protocol, teachers  implement the units of study in reading, writing, and math. Content and language objectives are introduced at the beginning  of each lesson. This allows for teachers to explicitly teach academic language. Units were revised during the summer last year  and will continue to be revised this summer, identifying gaps and adding critical thinking/higher order questioning into our  units as well as incorporating SIOP strategies to make content comprehensible for all ELLs. This revision is ongoing.             Teachers have also collaboratively created math units of study with lead teachers and in previous years with a Math  Aussie. These units incorporate a hands-on reality based approach to math. In bilingual classes it is taught in the home  language. All kindergarten students are assessed with checklists, first and second grade are assessed with unit tests, teacher  made tests, and teacher observation. An emphasis is placed on writing in the math content area and explaining their thinking.  Time is allocated during the math workshop to give students rich math writing tasks which will develop math academic  language as well as communication skills. Math unit tests are aligned with the CCLS standards in order to appropriately assess  our students.              In science, bilingual students receive instruction based on state standards. Students participate in hands on learning  experiences. This gives the students concrete experiences which aid in developing language in their home language as well as  in the new language.             Writing is emphasized at PS 170. Through our units of study, lessons are planned to improve students' writing skills.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79      Students assess their work through the use of child friendly checklists and rubrics. Students self edit to increase accountability  and develop a sense of ownership. Students are exposed to poetry, letter writing, research projects, and opinion writing  during the writer’s workshop, which includes interactive, guided, shared, and independent writing. Teachers conference with  students to set goals which will improve their writing skills.  Writing occurs in both the English and Spanish languages.             Centers are a focus of early childhood education. Their goal is to create independent learners, develop self reliance, and  social skills. Our classes are organized into literacy centers; students work cooperatively or independently in their groups to  complete tasks. Paraprofessionals are scheduled to assist in addressing the needs of the students.  Centers are created in both  English and Spanish.             The books in the school library are leveled to assist teachers in the selection of appropriate instructional material for  guided reading. There is also a teacher reference section, where teachers can access information to deepen their professional  knowledge.        Academic language is introduced through the use of content and language objectives.  Academic vocabulary is explicitly  taught through the use of total physical response (TPR), pictures/icons and partner talk and Frayer model.  Academic language  is developed by providing students with multi-sensory experiences. Students participate in hands on learning activities which  allow students to make connections between the concrete and abstract. Students work on grade appropriate projects in all  content areas. Through the use of content and language objectives, pictures/icons, picture walks, accountable talk, turn and  talk, total physical response, and group work, students are given the opportunity to use academic language in context. The  “share” portion of the workshop model gives students the opportunity to reflect on learning and articulate what they learned.             Technology is an integral part of our instructional day and is incorporated in all content areas. Technology is used to  develop the English language. Students visit grade appropriate websites and listen to stories, research topics, and practice  alphabet recognition and decoding. These websites include Razz-Kids, i-Ready, and Starfall.             Art, music, drama, and dance are used as vehicles to develop language and build self esteem. Students role play, put on  performances, and create the scenery for shows. Kindergarten and Second grade receive Puppetry through  our partnership  with Marquis Studio. In kindergarten, setting and dialogue was the focus where academic vocabulary was integrated through  role play. Second grade focused on our International Unit. Their focus was on building academic  language.             First and second grade ELLs participate in our percussion residence. Students learn how to read, write music, and play  instruments. There is a culminating performance where parents are invited to come and view their child’s performance.  Kindergarten students  participate in a circus residency. This goes very well with our speaking and listening focus. Students  learn about voice projection and articulation as well as acting and play writing. First and second grade students receive a full  year of music instruction. Students are exposed to tempo, pitch, dynamics and reading music. Students write and record a  class song. A cd release party is held at the end of the year, where all students receive a copy.  The language of instruction is  Spanish in bi-lingual classes and English for ELL's in monolingual classes, receiving ENL.             Kindergarten ELLs take part in our Chinese New Year Celebration. Students learn about the Chinese culture and parade  throughout the school showing their dragons.  The language of Art instruction is English.              Our ELL students celebrate the 100th Day of School. Students take part in various activities which allows them to explore  place value in mathematics.  Our Kindergarten students parade throughout the school sharing their work with their peers. The  language of instruction in bi-lingual classes is Spanish.  ENL students in monolingual classes receive Math in English.               We hold Annual Art Festivals. Students work is displayed and viewed by peers and parents. The language of instruction in  Art is English.              Our International Celebration provides student the opportunity to learn about other ethnic groups. Students learn about  costumes, foods, culture, dance, and languages. Classes make presentation to their peers and put on a performance for   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80      classmates and parents.   The language of instruction is based upon student's  proficiency level.  It may be English or Spanish.             Our ELL students show off their scientific skills, math skills or ELA  at our annual Literacy fair. Students make presentations  and answer questions about their displays. The language of instruction is based upon student's proficiency level.  It may be  English or Spanish.               We continue the implementation of the Cook Shop Program in a second grade bilingual class and the first ENL grade after  school program. This educates children about the nutritional value of food, making healthy choices, and actually making  nutritious recipes. There will be al lot of discussion about the food and their attributes.  The language of instruction is English.          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?     English Language Learners are assessed in their Home Language using EL SOL and Fountas and PInnel Benchmark Kit in  Spanish.  Writing baseline, mid line, and end line assessments are given in both Spanish and English.  Baseline, mid line, and  end line assessments are analyzed in both languages.  All data is collected and input into the P.S. 170 Online Data Tracking  System.  This online tracking system monitors student's progress throughout the three years they attend P.S. 170.  Math  baseline, mid line, and end line assessments are also given in the students' home language.  Data is collected and also input  into the same online tracking system that monitors and tracks students growth and progress throughout the three years they  attend P.S. 170.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       (a) We do not have any SIFE students at this time. In order to support future SIFE students we provide a supportive  environment created to respond to the social, cultural and linguistic needs. We also have parent access to support services  such as a counselor and parent coordinator. Teachers differentiate their instruction by different strategies such as hands on  learning, activating prior knowledge, working in cooperative grouping and weaving together language and content using the  SIOP framework.    (b) Since we are a Kindergarten to second grade school, all of our students are considered newcomers. Teachers differentiate  lessons to meet the needs of students. Students work in small groups during centers and for guided reading. Students may be  grouped according to proficiency level, reading level, skill needs, interest, or learning style. Bilingual teachers attend planning  sessions where the curriculum is discussed and modified to meet ELL student needs. Units of study have been revised to  incorporate SIOP strategies for interaction. Bilingual teachers participate in inter visitations as well as demo lessons from lead  teachers and their colleagues. Bilingual, monolingual, and special education teachers who provide services to ELLs have also  received professional development on differentiated instruction, critical thinking, and questioning techniques. Teachers will  continue to receive professional development in this area from DELLS. SIOP/LCI training is ongoing as well for higher order  critical thinking. Model teachers also model best practices in the classrooms. Teachers differentiate instruction by content,  process, product, ability and proficiency level. Teachers provide students with choice by allowing students to select a unit  project based in their learning style. We are also exploring activities with various entry points, so all students have access to  the learning, and choice as to how they want to present their learning. The Principal looks for the implementation of ALL  professional development as evidenced in teacher observations and lesson plans as per the Danielson Framework.    (c). The RTI teacher provides small group and individualized instruction to our at-risk ELL students. This small group also  includes any holdover students. These holdover students are also part of our after school program. These students receive  instruction in the areas of listening, speaking, reading, or writing based on the results of data.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81      (d). P.S. 170 is a kindergarten through second grade early childhood school. We do not have long term ELLs at this time. During  ELL meetings we keep parents informed about the importance of keeping their children in similar programs even when  switching schools. This helps our ELL students, even long term ELLs have a consistency when learning the new language. Long  term ELLs would be provided with rigorous instruction tailored to their individual needs in the classroom during Tier 1  instruction and if more support is needed, long term ELLs would receive support through the RTI and after school programs.    e). Former ELL's are entitled to two years transition. NYSESLAT data analysis shows 16% of students reached a commanding  proficiency level for the 2017 NYSESLAT assessment. Support is provided to students reaching proficiency level by providing  them with ENL services. Students are placed depending on data and teacher recommendation.              6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    We are a SIOP school. The Sheltered Instruction Observational Protocol is one of our focus at P.S. 170. This protocol helps  make content comprehensible for ALL learners, including SWD's and ELLs. Through the use of content and language objectives,  academic language is explicitly taught and reinforced. Teachers of ELL-SWD's also differentiate all materials and lessons in  order for SWD's to access content. Teachers provide students with choice by allowing students to select a unit project based in  their learning style. We are also exploring activities with various entry points, so all students have access to learning, and  choice as to how they want to present their learning. Teachers are also receiving professional learning in critical thinking and  higher order questioning with the Learner Centered Initiatives( LCI).  Student engagement has been our instructional focus for  the past two years. We believe that students must be active participants in the learning process. We have embedded  interaction strategies (such as inner outer circle, carousel, four corners) that come from SIOP, into our curriculum so students  are engaged with the content, teacher, and peers. We are now building on this idea and planning our student interactions and  conversations to be more rigorous. We have a discussion protocol that is used in all classrooms.           7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  We have a bilingual kindergarten, first and second grade class. The school's speech teacher is bilingual certified. ELL students  mandated to receive bilingual speech are receiving speech in their home language. We also have a bilingual psychologist two  days a week. She is scheduled to our school on Thursdays and Fridays. We have a physical therapist scheduled to our school  once a week to provide mandated services to ELL students. An occupational therapist has been assigned to our school two  days a week to provide mandated services to ELL students. Our school counselor services students who are mandated to  receive counseling. Parents of ELLs with special needs receive the appropriate information in their Native Language from the  School Based Support Team. The special education coordinator receives professional development and turn-keys all  information to special education and general education teachers. All general education teachers in addition to special  education teachers have been trained in using SESIS. All general education teachers in addition to special education teachers  have received training on using the Common Core Learning Standards to write IEP goals. All general education teachers have  also been trained in writing specific and detailed Present Levels of Performance. These general education teachers input all  information directly into SESIS during initial, annual and tri-annual reviews. All general education teachers and special  education teachers attend all IEP meetings. All IEP meetings are scheduled during the general education teacher's preparation  period. This frees the general education teacher to attend the IEP meeting with the related service providers.                 8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  English Language Learners, who have newly arrived to the country attend our After school Program for both ENL and HLA.  Students in the ENL after school program are grouped according to proficiency level. Our ENL program consists of bilingual and  ENL students that are at the entering, emerging, transitioning and expanding levels. Students participate in learning  experiences that enhance the development of the English language. Our HLA after school program consists of bilingual   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          82      students whose home language is limited. Students participate in learning experiences that gives the students a firm  foundation in their home language in order to make it easier to transfer to the new language. For RTI services, all students,  including ELLs are given ECLAS-2 as a pre-screener. An RTI criteria chart was created in order to identify candidates for RTI.  Students who fell within the TIER 2 and TIER 3 criteria were then given PALS, a more thorough screener to identify the specific  areas of need. Based on the PALS score, students are specified as either Tier 2 or Tier 3 on the RTI spectrum. We use the PALS  framework in conjunction with SIOP and other ENL strategies to enhance specific instructional plans for these students. ELL  students are progressed monitored every six to ten weeks. The PALS quick checks(progress monitoring) are used to determine  the focus, intensity and duration of the intervention. Scores for the quick check(progress monitoring) are entered in the PALS  on the online score entry and reporting system. Our RTI teacher, ELL coordinator, Principal and SWD coordinator will review  the RTI process in September 2017.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      During our 2017 summer planning our bilingual team will be focusing on best practices for writing. Teachers will be focusing on  strategies/activities that will support our ELLs to improve their writing, including sentence structure and grammar. Teachers  will look at the present curriculum and plan for vertical and horizontal alignment within the bilingual classes.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None of our ELL programs will be discontinued this year.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.    All of our classes participate in our percussion residence from our Arts partner, Marquis Studios. The music teacher goes to  each classroom once a week for the entire school year. Students learn how to read, write music, and play instruments. There is  a culminating performance where parents are invited to come and view their child's performance. Kindergarten students  participate in a circus residency from our Arts partner, Marquis Studios for the first part of the year. This helps with our  speaking and listening focus. Students learn about voice projection and articulation as well as acting and play writing. Our first  and second grade ELLs also participate in our partnership with Marquis Studios. All first and second grade English Language  Learners receive art expression and sculpture with Marquis Studio's teaching artists. Kindergarten ELLs take part in our Chinese  New Year Celebration. Students learn about the Chinese culture and parade throughout the school showing their dragons. Our  ELL students celebrate the 100th day of school. Students take part in various activities which allows them to explore place  value in mathematics. Our Kindergarten students parade throughout the school sharing their work with their peers. Our ELLs  also participate in our Annual Arts Festival. At the end of the year, our Art teacher displays our students' art work in the form  of an art gallery. Parents, members of the community and council board are invited. Our ELLs also participate in International  Month. International Month provides ELL students with the opportunity to learn about different cultures. Students learn about  costumes, foods, culture, dance, and languages. Classes present to their peers and put on a performance for classmates and  parents. We continue the implementation of the Cook Shop Program in a kindergarten and second grade bilingual class, and  first grade ENL after school program. This is a hands on program which develops the English Language through educating  children about the nutritional value of food, making healthy choices, and actually making nutritious recipes. There is a lot of  discussion about the food and their attributes using the senses to describe foods.    Our ELLs are also part of the Art and Drama Club.  At PS 170 we believe that all students benefit from the opportunity to learn  about and experience the arts. Study of the arts in its many forms is an essential part of achieving success in school, work and  life.  Administrators, teachers, parents, and community members the responsibility rests with us to nurture the creativity and  imagination that lives in our students. One of our extracurricular activities at PS 170 is the Art and Drama Club. First and  second grade students are invited to audition to the Art and Drama Club every year. For the 2017-2018 year, it is projected  that 30 students will take part of this program. The number of ELLs in the program will depend on the auditions that will take  place in the month of October 2017. These students participate in rigorous rehearsals twice a week after school and two  Saturdays in December and three-four Saturdays in May and June, leading up to their two annual musical theater productions.  In these rehearsals and performances,students sing, dance, and act in major theatrical works, refining and then showcasing  their incredible talents and hard work. Students create settings and scenery incorporating the visual arts. Some performances   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          83      include “The Nutcracker”, “Annie”, “The Wiz”, “Where’s Your Holiday Spirit” and “A Christmas Carol”.    Our second grade students also attend swim classes for the entire school year once a week at The New Settlement Community  Center. Students build independence and relaxation in the water, learn breath control, floating and swimming techniques.  They each receive their own swim caps and goggles.     In order to accommodate the needs of our ELL’s we will continue to offer an ENL and Home Language After School Program on  Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:40pm – 4:10pm for our first and second grade ELL students for the 2017-2018 school year.  IT is projected to start in October 2017. Our ENL After school Program consists of bilingual and ENL students that are at the  Entering, Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding levels in the English language. Our school has a total of 74 ELL’s. From these  74 ELL’s we have projected that half of our ELL’s will participate in our ENL and Home Language programs. Students participate  in learning experiences that enhance the development of the English language and in their home language.  There are four teachers that take part of our ENL and Home Language after school programs. For our ENL After school Program  students are grouped according to proficiency level. Three teachers service students at the Entering, Emerging, Transitioning  and Expanding levels.  Three teachers are bilingual certified and one teacher is bilingual/TESOL certified. The ELLs at the  Entering/Emerging levels of proficiency use the REACH into Phonics program and SIOP strategies are embedded in instruction.  The SIOP framework is a researched based model of sheltered instruction that helps our teachers plan and deliver lessons that  allow our ELL's to acquire academic knowledge as they develop English proficiency. Transitioning ELL students use the Carousel  of Ideas Program and SIOP model.The Carousel program is a science and social studies content based program that fosters the  development of students’ English language listening, speaking, reading and writing skills while developing their academic skills  and cognitive abilities.  Expanding ELL students use the Cook Shop Program. The Cook Shop Program is a science content-  based program that uses hands-on exploration, cooking and physical activities to foster children’s enjoyment and consumption  of healthy food and their appreciation for good nutrition.  Students learn where food comes from and how it grows. The ENL  After school Program will run from October 2017 to June 2018. The language of instruction is English.  Our bilingual classes service many newcomers that do not come with a strong foundation in their home language. After  analyzing the Word Work Assessment, Fountas and Pinell  and the Writing baseline in Spanish, we decide who needs the  additional support to participate in the Home Language After school program.  La Cartilla program from SantillanaUSA is used  for this after school program. This comprehensive phonics program supports Spanish literacy development with phonemic  awareness, phonics, and vocabulary development. It is projected that the Home Language program will run from October 2017  to June 2018. The language of instruction is Spanish.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.     We are a SIOP school. The Sheltered Instruction Observational Protocol has been one of our focus at P.S. 170. Our focus has  been student interaction and engagement. We use a discussion protocol for discussion academic language support. This  protocol helps make content comprehensible for ALL learners, including SWD's and ELLs. Through the use of content and  language objectives, academic language is explicitly taught and reinforced. Teachers of ELL-SWD's also differentiate all  materials and lessons in order for SWD's to access content. We have a vast variety of big books , guided reading books and  science/ social studies materials in both English and Spanish. Teachers provide students with choice by allowing students to  select a unit project based in their learning style. We are also exploring activities with various entry points, so all students have  access to learning, and choice as to how they want to present their learning.    Technology is an integral part of our instructional day and is incorporated in all content areas. Technology is used to develop  the English language. Students visit grade appropriate websites and listen to stories, research topics, and practice alphabet  recognition and decoding. These websites include Razz-kids, Starfall, and i-Ready. Students also research, look at instructional  videos to aid in researching for a topic of choice. We continue the implementation of the CookShop Program in kindergarten  and second grade bilingual classes and the ENL first grade after school program. This educates children about the nutritional  value of food, making healthy choices, and actually making nutritious recipes.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          84               13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?     English Language Learners are assessed in their Home Language using EL SOL and Fountas and PInnel Benchmark Kit in  Spanish. Writing baseline, mid line, and end line assessments are given in both Spanish and English. Baseline, mid line, and end  line assessments are analyzed in both languages. All data is collected and input into the P.S. 170 Online Data Tracking System.  This online tracking system monitors student's progress throughout the three years they attend P.S. 170. Math baseline, mid  line, and end line assessments are also given in the student’s home language. Data is collected and also input into the same  online tracking system that monitors and tracks students growth and progress throughout the three years they attend P.S.  170.            14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.      We have a bilingual kindergarten, first and second grade class. The school's speech teacher is bilingual certified. ELL students  mandated to receive bilingual speech are receiving speech in their home language. The speech teacher uses strategies that are  grade and age appropriate that include visuals and instructional games. We also have a bilingual psychologist two days a week.  She is scheduled to our school on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Our social worker meets with ELL students individually to  support ELL students. We have a physical therapist scheduled to our school once a week to provide mandated services to ELL  students. An occupational therapist has been assigned to our school two days a week to provide mandated services to ELL  students. We have a school counselor to service students who are mandated to receive counseling. Our counselor also uses  visuals, books and instructional games that are grade and age appropriate. Parents of ELLs with special needs receive the  appropriate information in their Native Language from the School Based Support Team. The special education coordinator  receives professional development and turn-keys all information to special education and general education teachers.               15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     Our school does not share a building.           16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   In May we host two kindergarten orientation meetings in order for our new parents of ELLs and non-ELL parents get  information about our school. The parent coordinator welcomes the parents. A Welcome Kit is also given to the parents that  includes our school information and other supplies that contribute to a positive beginning. We include coupons for the parents  to use to to buy uniforms. It includes relevant school information such as a school calendar and what academic supplies they  will need for the year, no matter when the student enrolls. The parent coordinator, with the help of the ELL coordinator, set up  the welcome kits and decide what should go in the welcome kit. We also stack welcome kits for other grades in order to have  them readily available throughout the year as new ELL students enroll. These welcome kits are in English and Spanish.  The  welcome kits are sent to the translation unit to be translated to other languages represented in the school.         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We do not have language electives.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          85         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  We use every opportunity to provide professional development to teachers in implementing ENL strategies to improve  instruction, enhance learning, and develop awareness of the Common Core Learning Standards. City wide professional  development days (September, November and June),  and planning days are utilized for site based training. For the 2017-2018  school year our teachers will be trained  by SIOP consultants. The SIOP model provides research based instructional strategies  that help support the academic and linguistic needs od students.  Common grade preps, throughout the week  from 9:05 -9:50 am and Monday UFT professional learning time, from 2:40-4:00  pm  are used to analyze student work, analyze data, and make instructional decisions; this is done with the  principal,instructional leaders, ELL Coordinator, and teachers. Teachers also attend various professional development sessions  offered by the Bronx Borough Field Support Center and DELLSS. Our bilingual teachers attended various professional  development .  In September, teachers receive a copy of the NYSESLAT scores and identify student needs and proficiency levels with the aide  of the ELL Coordinator. During planning sessions with grade leaders and principal, strategies are shared by our bilingual and  ENL teachers within the four modalities. Teachers  use this data and strategies to address the needs of individual students.  A  bilingual teacher team, led by the ENL/bilingual coordinator, was also created to analyze the NYSESLAT results.  From this tool  a data report is created to aide teachers in planning and drive instruction within the four modalities. Bilingual teachers have  their own common planning time.  Inter-visitations are scheduled based on the needs of teachers. A grade leader has been identified on each grade. Prep periods  are arranged so teachers on a grade have the opportunity to meet and plan, including the bilingual team. Calendar changes are  scheduled for professional development. Common planning sessions are scheduled and used for planning and discussion on  instruction. The ELL and Special education coordinators attend  professional development provided by DOE/DELLS. Our school  counselor also attends professional development provided by DOE/DELLS.  Teachers attend  summer planning sessions. The focus is revising literacy and math units of study and align them with the CCLS  and ELL Blueprint. This summer, there will also be a bilingual summer planning to work on strategies that can be used for our  ELLs to support them in writing. To implement our Language Allocation Policy, we provide professional development to  monolingual, special education, and bilingual teachers, speech therapist, physical therapist, secretary, and parent coordinator.  In the Fall, all teachers and related service providers receive and review and analyze a copy of the NYSESLAT scores. Teachers  identify student needs.  For the 2017-2018 year our school will continue to be part of the Teacher Rounds professional development model. Two  teacher teams will be considered to work collaboratively.  The teachers themselves will direct their own course of learning  through observation and analysis of teaching. The teacher rounds enables teachers to work collaboratively  to improve student  learning  and enhancing the profession of teaching. All subgroups will be targeted. The area of need for teacher rounds will be  discussion and interaction.  All CookShop Classroom teachers receive comprehensive, interactive training and support from Food Bank staff, as well as all  of the curriculum materials, food, supplies and equipment needed to implement the program successfully.  The bilingual team will continue to meet to modify curricula for language and content in order to support our ELLs and aligning  it vertically and horizontally by grade.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          86                   2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    We use every opportunity to provide teachers with professional development in developing strategies to improve instruction  and enhance learning. When given the appropriate tools teachers can meet the academic needs of their students providing  them with a high quality education. Professional learning is ongoing. There are regular opportunities for teachers to plan  together. Professional learning in math and literacy are scheduled throughout the school year. The teachers spend  full days  revising curriculum based on the needs of the students with the focus of ensuring alignment with the CCLS and embedding  SIOP components such as language and content objectives, student interaction and critical thinking. The ELL coordinator  receives periodic news and opportunities for educators of ELLs. The ELL coordinator sends these professional opportunities to  all the staff. ENL teacher will also be participating in different ELL PDs and will turnkey the information to entire staff.  Principal  keeps track of all PDs given -in house and PDs given by DELLSS and keeps agendas and attendance.    For the 2017-2018 our school will continue to be part of the Teacher Rounds. A team of teachers from every grade will  participate in this inquiry based model. The facilitators will participate in sessions at the district level. All subgroups will be  targeted, including ELLs. Teachers will also be part of TCIS ( Therapeutic Crisis Intervention for Schools) at the Bronx Field  Support Center). New teachers will be attending several Passport to Social Studies PDs and integrated Co-teaching PDs which  include teachers of ELLs. Our RTI teacher and paraprofessionals will be attending Reading Rescue PDs throughout the year.  Teachers will be able to provide one on one skilled intensive intervention to our at risk students, including ELLs. Our Art and  Dance teacher will be attending City Wide PD Series on integrating language and content through the arts. During our full  day DOE PDs teachers will be getting further training on the SIOP Model. We will continue to focus on comprehensible input  and interaction.                  Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?        Bi-weekly profile sheets are sent home to parents informing them of students goals and academic performance. Profile  sheets are also sent home in Spanish for bilingual classes and any other parent that chose Spanish as their language  preference. For our ENL students in our monolingual settings, our ENL teacher meets with the parents throughout the year to  inform them of students' language development,  their child’s English language proficiency assessment results, and language  development needs in all content areas.  The ENL teacher also informs them on the unit that is being worked on and what skills  are begin taught and how CCLS is being addressed. A snapshot sheet of the student, similar to profile sheets, are explained and  given to parents. This snapshot shows proficiency level, NYSESLAT results, progress student is making and goals for the  student. Attendance is tracked for parent meetings/contact. If a parent needs translation, the parent coordinator is available  to translate for the teacher and parent.Translation is available at all parent events( workshops, parent teacher conferences,  hold-over meetings, IEP meetings, parent association meetings, Parent orientation meetings, and performances. Staff is   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          87         available to assist parents with the interpretation in Spanish. We have a list of agencies which translate to parents who speak  languages other than Spanish. These conferences are held via telephone.                     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   We acknowledge that the home school partnership is an essential tool to foster learning.  At PS 170 we make an effort to  inspire parents to become involved in their child's education.  This has resulted in a high percentage of parental involvement in  all school events.  Examples of this are the performances throughout the school year which include the Fall and  Spring performances by the Art and Drama Club and the Art Gallery which many parents attend to celebrate students'  art work.  We have an open door policy, where parents feel free to visit the school and meet with administration and staff to  discuss their children's education.  Parents attend "Meet the Teacher Week and Parent Teacher Conferences. Parents also  attend  Monthly Parent Association Meetings and Town Hall Meetings are scheduled to keep parents informed about the  operation of the school and upcoming events.   A parent coordinator is available to assist parents with any concerns.    The school understands the importance for families to be involved in their children's education. We ensure that all parents  have regular access to clear, concise, and easily readable information about their children's school and classroom. Our school  communicates with parents via bi-weekly profile sheets to keep parents up to date on their child's behavior, academic  progress and any other concerns that teachers might want parents to know about.  We have an open line of communication  between the parents and the school with the Principal's open door policy and  the use of  L1 whenever possible. Each teacher  has a class website to inform parents about what is happening in their classrooms, as well as weekly homework and units  being taught.     For our Tuesday parent engagement time, our classroom teachers give parent workshops either by grade or by class. For the  bilingual classes it is conducted in Spanish. They go over grade unit overviews, understanding CCLS, and also have special craft  sessions on special holidays. In the Spring, our ENL coordinator gives workshops for parents about NYSESLAT assessment. We  have a workshop for our bilingual classes in their L1 and another one for our non-Spanish ELL parents. We want our parents to  understand why their children take the NYSESLAT and the impact it has on their children's progress of L2.     During the 2017-2018 school year we will also be having  movie night and a night with the Harlem Wizards. Starting in the  Spring, percussion sessions for parents and their children will be held to  learn how to play different percussion instruments.    Parent association meetings are held monthly to keep parents informed of school events. Time is allotted for questions and  concerns. At this time a survey is given to parents to assess their needs. They can make suggestions for future workshops.  Parents are also members of the School Leadership Team and Language Allocation Policy Team. The parent representative  shares concerns any parent may have at this time. The parent coordinator has built successful relationships with parents. The  parent coordinator proactively addresses parent interests and concerns. Parent Surveys are reviewed. The parent coordinator  reaches out to various community based organizations to provide workshops and other services to our ELL parents. Activities  and guest speakers are scheduled based on the results of the survey and feedback from parent meetings, Town Hall Meetings,  School Leadership Team Meetings and Language Allocation Policy Team Meetings. During our parent association meetings and  parent orientation meetings we inform our parents that we provide free services of translation and interpretation in Spanish  by our school staff.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Sonia Acevedo Suarez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          92                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Esteban Vicente Elementary                                                                              School DBN: 09X170  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Language translation and interpretation data is collected through the preference language forms, home language  surveys, interview with parents and child when they come to register their children and ATS reports. A bilingual/  ELL coordinator, a bilingual Parent Coordinator and bilingual school secretary are available to address the  translation needs of parents. Every letter is translated into Spanish. When necessary we reach out to agencies and  the Translation Interpretation Unit for interpretation and translation in other languages.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          94      Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    English   Spanish   Bambara   Twi   Arabic      French           131   123   1   1   1      1   51%   48%   0.3%   0.3%   0.3%      0.3%   131   123   1   1   1      1   51%   48%   0.3%   0.3%   0.3%      0.3%   3.

For other languages  represented in the school, with  parent request we sent the  documents to the translation unit to  be translated.    2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as   parent-teacher   conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.        Meeting Name    Month/Frequency of Meetings    How does your school plan to provide   Parent Association meetings and  parent orientation meetings         Throughout the year   interpretation service(s)?    During our parent association  meetings we inform our parents that  we provide free services of translation  and interpretation in Spanish by our  school staff. We also inform our  parents that our Parent coordinator is  bilingual. If our parents need  translation or interpretation in other  languages we have a list of agencies  which translates to parents who speak  languages other than Spanish.   Parent teacher conferences   September, November, March, and May  During our parent teacher conferences  we inform our parents that we provide  translation in Spanish by our school  staff. If a teacher needs translation in  Spanish, the ELL coordinator, the  parent coordinator or school  counselor is called to translate. If a  parent requests translation in a  language other than Spanish, we have  a list of agencies which translates to  parents who speak languages other  than Spanish.   Hold over meetings   January and February   During hold over meetings we inform  our parents that we provide  translation in Spanish by our school  staff. If a parent needs translation in  Spanish, the ELL coordinator, the  parent coordinator or school  counselor is called to translate. At hold  over meetings, the principal, who  speaks Spanish, translates for parents  who speak Spanish if other staff is not  available. If a parent of another  language is needed, we have a list of  agencies which translates to parents   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          96      IEP meetings   Throughout the year   who speak languages other than  Spanish.   The language interpretation unit is  notified and a translator is scheduled  prior to all initial, annual, and tri- annual reviews for parents of SWDs to  attend all IEP meetings via phone  conference or in person.           3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      We make sure that the blue emergency cards have the language preference for the parent. In case of an emergency,  we keep the RAPL report on file to contact parents as well. Our staff members who speak Spanish would call the  parents that have indicated Spanish as their preferred language. We also keep a list of agencies which translates to  parents who speak languages other than Spanish. We would use these agencies and use a three way line to inform the  parents in case of an emergency.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      During the beginning of the school year our LAC informs staff members that we provide translation and interpretation  services to our parents. The school also will schedule a session on translation and interpretation services. For  translation of letters sent out to parents, all of them are translated into Spanish by school staff. For interpretation and  translation in other languages we inform our staff that we have a list of agencies which translates to parents who  speak languages other than Spanish. We provide our staff with resources to help support staff in monitoring parent  language needs. During the month of October, a professional development session will be given to staff on  translations and interpretation services.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      During our PTA meetings the LAC makes parents aware of their right to receive information in their preferred  language. Many of our staff members are bilingual and serve as translators and interpreters. We also reach out to the  Language Interpretation Unit and other agencies to serve as interpreters for languages not spoken by our staff. The  Language Interpretation unit is notified and a translator is scheduled prior to all initial, annual, and tri-annual reviews  for parents of SWD's to attend all IEP meetings via phone conference or in person. During the registration process,  documents are given to the parent in the preferred language. During parent -teacher conferences a copy of report  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          97      card explanations from the Translation and Interpretation Unit's intranet site are given to parents in the preferred  language which include Spanish, Arabic and French.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       During our Parent association meeting, parents are given a survey to complete. This survey informs our school on the  quality we give our parents on language and interpretation services. These surveys are sent to the Translation unit to  be translated into Spanish, Arabic and French.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          98
