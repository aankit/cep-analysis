The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      1.

Our size allows us to offer students many great opportunities in the classroom, extensive course  electives, a large number of Advanced Placement and College Extension courses, as well as many extracurricular  opportunities. Our internal redesign in the Fall of 2006 into eight Smaller Learning Communities (SLC's), has created  the feel that we are not “over sized” and has allowed our students to feel a sense of family and belonging within the  school. Our goal at New Dorp is to support improved attendance and scholarship as well as to address the social and  emotional needs of all students as we prepare them for college and career opportunities. When you walk through the  doors of New Dorp, you will experience a very welcoming and private school type of atmosphere with an  unmistakable high morale. Students describe the culture of New Dorp High School as a school with an “Old School  Charm, but in a new kind of way....a modern Riddell High School!"      Smaller Learning Communities (SLC's) Structure:   In order to provide a variety of exciting and challenging programs that prepare students for post-secondary  opportunities, students select admission into one of eight Smaller Learning Communities based on interest. These  programs offer students the opportunity to participate in specialized areas of concentration in addition to their  academic coursework. All students, grades 9 through 12, are enrolled in one of the following Eight Smaller Learning  Communities:       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11         Corporate Center for  Software Engineering &  Virtual Enterprise   Future Teachers  Academy   The Law Institute &  AFJROTC Program   The Math & Science  Institute   Academy of  Communication & Media  Arts   Academy of Fine and  Dramatic Arts   The Institute of Forensic  Science & Criminology   Institute of Health  Sciences   A challenging program that allows students to select one of two strands: the software  engineering program, which exposes students to various topics including computer  programming, robotics, and web design; or the Virtual Enterprise program, an  NYS-Approved CTE sequence that includes an in-depth study of business and computer  applications, coupled with simulated corporate experience..Students have the opportunity  to take four college business courses through our partnership with the College of Staten  Island beginning in the Fall of their Junior year.

The special qualities of these Smaller Learning Communities include:       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12      ● Students choose a program based on their interest during the admissions/articulation process.   ● Students take the majority of their classes in the same wing; therefore, student traffic throughout the building is  minimized.   ● Teachers choose programs in a manner similar to students and remain dedicated to that program and its students.   ● An assistant principal and a team of two teacher coordinators supervise each program. This allows for more direct  supervision of a smaller number of students.   ● Each program has its own guidance counselor and the assistance of a dedicated school aide who is responsible for  outreach to parents regarding attendance and cutting.   ● There are approximately 400 students in each program.   ● Curriculum and course sequences are continually updated to incorporate interdisciplinary units as well as the  themes of these programs, in order to enhance instruction and support the needs of all students.   ● ELL and students with special needs are included in the Smaller Learning Community of their choice and receive  mandated services as prescribed.   ● Students receive the benefits of a large school, such as a comprehensive Physical Education program, extensive  advance placement and college level course offerings, and a large variety of extra-curricular teams and activities.   Given the diverse focus of each of our eight Smaller Learning Communities, we are confident that every youngster will  find a program at New Dorp that sparks the imagination and inspires them to their fullest potential.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Student Demographics:   Our current student population is comprised of 28.01% Hispanic, 0.38 Native American, 7.63 Asian, .17 Hawaiian/PI,  11.10% Black, 51.96 White and .76% other ethnicity's or not reported. 21.07% of students have I.E.P.'s with varying  levels of support services. Within the special education services, we offer SETSS, ICT, ASD, and Horizon programs, Self- contained classes and other personalized supports. We pride ourselves on the fact that we utilize flexible  programming wherever possible so that students are educated in the least restrictive environment. As seen below,  the SWD population achieves at a level of almost double the NYS cut point for this sub group. The instruction, in  particular, our school-wide literacy/writing program, has supported the improved student outcomes for this  population and is one of the reasons that New Dorp High School was designated as a NYC Showcase School.      The ENL population has increased over the years to 5.4% of the population. We continue to design instruction and  supports that align to city and state regulations. We provide supports to families in their home language and our on- line grading system allows us to translate ancedotals and emails to parents. As our total school population has  increased, we focus our hiring efforts on finding individuals who speak a second language to assist us in  communicating with the families of our students, both ENL and other students, where English is a second language at  home.   As a NYS Focus School, we continue to monitor the impact of our practices on our struggling sub group, black males,  who have failed to make AYP in the last three years. We have made strides in the graduation rate of our black males       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           13      in the citywide lowest third over the past three years (see chart below), but the rate is still not parallel to our overall  graduation rate. We do anticipate a +6% increase from 61% graduation rate in 2017 to an anticipated 67% graduation  rate for this sub group for 2018. Upon further analysis of data, out of the 85 students in this subgroup (2018 cohort),  63 of these students started 9th grade and have spent 4 years at New Dorp. 73% of these students will graduate in 4  years as members of the class of 2018, +6% over the full group which includes students that have transferred into  New Dorp after 9th grade and as late as a month ago.

We  started this reform effort with a 54.9% graduation rate for the class of 2005 and 57.4% graduation rate for the class  of 2006. Fast forward to the class of 2018 where we closed June with an 81.1% graduation rate, the highest in the  last 20 years. In fact, the graduation rate for the class of 2018 in June is higher than all of the June + August rates of  the last 20 years. We are anticipating an 82.5% graduation rate after summer school for the 2018 Cohort.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Framework for Great Schools:   In reviewing the 2017-2018 school year, with focus on data to inform next steps. Our recent Quality Review report  outlined eight areas rated "Well-Developed" and two area rated "Proficient". Those areas rated proficient will be  addressed in this document. In order to determine the progress made in the last year, aligned with the Framework for  Great Schools, we thought it was best to review the progress towards the 2017-18 CEP goals.   Rigorous Instruction:   By August of 2018, the overall passing rate on the Common Core Algebra Regents will increase by 5% for all students.   End-year check-in: Last June, we had a 69% passing rate for 707 students (First time passing rate for incoming  students was 74%) and in August, we had a 49% passing rate for 80 students. Combined, we had a 66.9% passing rate  for 787 students. This June we had a 61% passing rate for 628 students, 14% below our targeted goal.   We had four years of progress in this area, and were therefore planning to focus on the data and instruction for the  new Global History Regents, but June data revealed that we must continue to focus on math instruction because of  the decrease in the data as well as the fact that 80% of our first time 10th grade students who took the Global exam,  passed the exam with a 65% or higher.  Supportive Environment:     By June 2018, the suspension rate at New Dorp High School will decrease by 5% as compared to the 2016-  2017 school year by utilizing restorative justice strategies and the expanded implementation of the Peer  Group Connection (PGC) program, as part of a school wide "School Culture" initiative.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           15         Suspensions  Principals  Superintendent   2015-2016  Jan 2016  97  31   June 2016  98 Total:195  24 Total: 55   2016-2017  Jan 2017  44  12   June 2017  69 Total: 113  26 Total: 38   2017-2018  Jan 2018  23  28   June 2018  58 Total: 81  16 Total: 44   End-year check-in: This goal has been met, see below. Much more than a 5% decrease.     Collaborative Teachers:     Teachers will collaborate utilizing an inquiry process for the review of data to inform instructional and   curricular decisions, leading to at least 80% of the 9th grade cohort accumulating at least 10 credits in their  first year and the 10th grade cohort accumulating a total of 20 credits (over two years) by August 2018.   # of students    Grade   Total # of students   5+ for 9th graders   % Meeting criteria   9th   10th   751  764   15+ for 10th for 10th graders  614  623   81.3%  80.9%   End-year check-in: This goal has been met, see below.     Effective School Leadership:     As a result of school leader’s effective implementation of the Advance system of evaluation and support, 80%   of the teacher observation ratings of component 3B, 3C and 3D as measured by the Advance system, will be  effective or highly effective, by June of 2018.   End-year check-in: Data review as of May 2018 reveals the following. We met our goal for all three components. As  per our Quality Review, this is an area that we did not receive a "Well-developed based on the Quality of the written  reports and feedback.

The chart below indicates the growth of parent engagement and communication using tools such as: social media,  website visits, PupilPath mass email, live streaming, phone messages and paper mail. The chart below was recorded  at: PTA meetings, Pep Rally views, graduation, Parent Engagement nights, SLC award nights, senior awards, academic  ceremonies, orientations, Parent Teacher conferences, Winter & Spring shows and parent workshops.      Website Traffic   2016-2017 school year: 1.01 mil visits  2017-2018 school year: 1.06 mil visits   We have made major improvements in the component of the framework, therefore we will move towards a new goal  for 2018-19, while still keeping pace with this work.  Trust: When addressing the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, data from the Quality Review, NYC School  Survey, feedback from Showcase School visitors and MPPR visits reals that the strengths and accomplishments of the  New Dorp High School community lie in the fact that there is a strong trust between staff, administration, students  and parents.                    2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           17      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 31R440   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   3045   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Guidance staff will be available on Saturday's and after-school by  appointment, to provide support to New Dorp families.        Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment   Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.  During the 2017-18, New Dorp High School implemented a Restorative Justice Program, staffed with a full time social  worker, a lead teacher/coordinator and a representative from a CBO. We have just been informed that the NYC  Council did not approve to renew this budgetary support, so we will have to financially support this endeavor. In  addition, grant from the Staten Island Foundation has ended, so we will support this PGC program (Peer Group  Connection) which is staffed with 4 lead teachers, one full time guidance counselor and had a required staff  development program, student retreat and parent "family night" component. It is necessary to provide funds for food  and lodging for the student retreat and dinner for the family night activity. There will be a need to utilize budgetary  funds for Dr. Mikey and the NY Center of Interpersonal Development, who provide on-going staff development. The  hiring of an additional counselor to support the most at-risk students of each SLC, will need to be supported.      The structure of the SLC with dedicated counselors and daily common planning time, will allow us to structure PD for  both students and staff in a personalized manner.     Part 4b.

Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement  planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal.  We will monitor the progress of this goal utilizing the results of the 2018-2019 NYC School Survey results, the OORS  data, suspension data, incident data and internal guidance data collected from the SLC counselors and student  councils. We will also monitor teacher evaluation results in competency 2A, 2D and 3C (Advance). Each piece of data  will be measured against the same data as compared to one year prior. The mid-year benchmark should indicate that  there is at least a 10% improvement in each piece of data.     Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress.  The data examined will include guidance referral data, attendance data at counseling sessions, lunch time circles,  classroom presentations, special presentations, student training centers, suspension data, OORS reports, incident  data, restorative justice data, and mediation reports. We will aggregate data from these sources to determine an  overall progress for this goal.     Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action  plan, if applicable.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           35      Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans   Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success  and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 4: Teacher Practices  and Decisions)    Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice  Tenet 4 Statement of Practice  Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the  appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.  4.2  School and teacher leaders ensure that instructional practices and strategies are organized   around annual, unit, and daily lesson plans that address all student goals and needs.   4.3  Teachers provide coherent, and appropriately aligned Common Core Learning Standards   (CCLS)-based instruction that leads to multiple points of access for all students.   4.4  Teachers and students work together to implement a program/plan to create a learning   environment that is responsive to students’ varied experiences and tailored to the strengths  and needs of all students.   4.5  Teachers inform planning and foster student participation in their own learning process by   SOP(s)   Addressed   X   X            using a variety of summative and formative data sources (e.g., screening, interim measures,  and progress monitoring).  Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus:  Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the  most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources  should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review,  NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School  Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.        1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and   year.   2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   The School Quality Snapshot for New Dorp indicated that during the 2016-17 school year, 81.3% of 9th grade students  earned 10 or more credits, falling short of "like, borough or comparison" schools who had 83% of students gaining  enough credits to be on track for graduation. There is a need for a specific focus to on this piece of data if we are to  retain students past the 9th grade and keep them on track for graduation.    When reviewing the same data for the 10th grade students, only 80.9% of these students have earned 20 or more  credits over the last 2 years. This will lead to almost 20% of these students being off-track for graduation. The School  Quality Report indicates that this 10th grade data shows deficiencies as compared to "like, borough or comparison  schools as well.   It is important to note that more than 10 years of “Strategic Inquiry Work” has led to the discovery and understanding of  the academic deficits and gaps that exist at New Dorp High School. Implementing the Judith Hochman writing strategies  has led to great academic gains. On the 9th grade level, the concentration is at the sentence, annotating text (close  reading) and outlining level. The instruction in 10th grade classrooms is focused on the multi-paragraph outline and  essay writing, but doesn’t abandon the sentence level strategies. In the 11th grade, student’s sentences are richer and  more sophisticated with a clear draft, review, revise and editing process in place for the essays and citation. 12th grade  students receive step by step instruction on the development of a college level research paper utilizing all of the skills  taught in 9th-11th grade. At the present time, we have created workbooks for three grades in Social Studies, two grade       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           36      levels in ELA, two grade levels in Science, three grades in Health and Physical Education, one year in Spanish and Italian  and some lessons in the Arts (but not a comprehensive year). The skill development is used to support the bridge from  the instruction of the past to that of the Common Core instruction. We have collected data that indicates that the  students who start New Dorp in the 9th grade are more likely to be on track for graduation, then those who transfer in  at a later date. This has led us to examine two things, first, we have seen proof that reading, writing, thinking and  speaking skills have improved based on review of student work, secondly, we are falling short as a school in supporting  the skill development of those who enter after 9th grade. There must be a plan in place to support these students.   In terms of the Capacity Framework, structures are already in place whereas teacher collaboration is a culture rather  than a practice. Cycles of inquiry lead teachers to readjust instruction, realign curriculum, establish effect strategies,  differentiate skill development and inform PD planning. Distributive leadership has led to an ownership of student  outcomes. The collaborative atmosphere has created a parallel supportive atmosphere for students and staff. Parents  are informed as to the focus of the writing program, student progress through use of skill portfolios and the  expectations for each grade level.   The results of the recent Quality review cited that "teacher collaboration was an area of celebration at New Dorp High  School, rating 4.2 as "Well-Developed". It was further stated: "All teachers participate in structured collaboration that  strengthen instructional practices and promotes the integration of the Common Core Learning Standards. Teacher  teams analyze instructional practices, student work and data across the school"        Part 2 – Annual Goal    Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.  Teachers will collaborate utilizing an inquiry process for the review of data to inform instructional and curricular  decisions, leading to at least 85% of the 9th grade cohort accumulating at least 10 credits in their first year and the 10th  grade cohort accumulating a total of 20 credits (over two years) by August 2019. .             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           37     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies your  school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this  Framework for Great Schools element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action  plan, if applicable.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           40      Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans      Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and  nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional  support that drives student achievement. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions)    Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice  Tenet 2 Statement of Practice  Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the  appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.  2.2  The school leader ensures that the school community shares the Specific, Measurable,   Ambitious, Results-oriented, and Timely (SMART) goals/mission and long-term vision inclusive  of core values that address the priorities outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP).  Leaders make strategic decisions to organize programmatic, human, and fiscal capital  resources.   2.3   2.4  The school leader has a fully functional system in place aligned to the district's Annual   Professional Performance Review (APPR) to conduct targeted and frequent observation and  track progress of teacher practices based on student data and feedback.   2.5  Leaders effectively use evidence-based systems and structures to examine and improve   X   critical individual and school-wide practices as defined in the SCEP (student achievement,  curriculum and teacher practices; leadership development; community/family engagement;  and student social and emotional developmental health).   SOP(s)   Addressed               Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus:  Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the  most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources  should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review,  NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School  Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.     1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and   year.   2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Evidence has shown that all areas of student data have improved over the last six years but there is still a need to focus  on skill development in the classroom. With a focus on teacher performance and classroom instruction, we can further  close the gaps on student achievement and prepare students for the rigor of the common core and the challenges of  post-secondary education. During our recent Quality Review, we received eight Well-Developed ratings and two  Proficient ratings. The two Proficient ratings were in 4.1 Teacher Support and Supervision and 1.2 Pedagogy. The  findings are found here with deficits bolded:   4.1       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           41      - Sch ool  lead ers  anal yze  Adv anc e  dat a  whi ch  rev eale d  that  alth oug h  exte nsiv e  wor k  occ urs  in  are as  of  desi gnin g  coh ere nt  inst ruct ion,  usin g  que stio ns  and  disc ussi on  tec      2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           42      hni que s,  eng agin g  stu den ts in  lear ning  and  usin g  asse ssm ent  in  inst ruct ion,  som e  staf f  are  still  wor king  tow ards  imp lem enti ng  thes e  me asur es.

In addition, a review of the ADVANCE data from the 2017-2018 school year, we have discovered deficits in the areas 1e  Designing Coherent Instruction, 3B Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques, 3C Engaging Students in Learning and  3D Using Assessments in Instruction. Uniform or common assessments are being utilized, created and analyzed in an  effective manner, but the day to day formative assessment use is not at the level that it should be. The weaknesses  discovered in 1e have a strong effect on the other three competencies.   In terms of the Capacity Framework, all six elements must be kept in mind for this goal to succeed, especially the 6th  competency of trust. As a school community, we have made much progress, but the need is there to continue the  difficult work of meeting the needs of all students and graduating more than 80% of a cohort.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice  Tenet 6 Statement of Practice  Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the  appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.  6.2  The school leader ensures that regular communication with students and families fosters their   high expectations for student academic achievement.    6.3  The school engages in effective planning and reciprocal communication with family and  community stakeholders so that student strength and needs are identified and used to  augment learning.   X   6.4  The school community partners with families and community agencies to promote and provide  training across all areas (academic and social and emotional developmental health) to support  student success.   6.5  The school shares data in a way that promotes dialogue among parents, students, and school   community members centered on student learning and success and encourages and empowers  families to understand and use data to advocate for appropriate support services for their  children.   SOP(s)   Addressed               Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus:  Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the  most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources  should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review,  NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School  Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.     1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and   year.   2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   During the 2017-18 school year, we stayed focused on improving and increasing our parent engagement. We set our  CEP goal and monitored it throughout the year. The results of the tracking of that data are shared below in the Parent  and Family Engagement Policy in this document. In addition, Data has revealed that our parent communication and  participation has increased tremendously as seen in the graph below as well as the parental responses ranging from 87%  to 97% in the "Strong Family-Community Ties" section of the NYC DOE School Quality Guide. With this in mind, we will  still make every effort to continue our work in this area, but it was a decision made by the many constituencies of the  New Dorp school community, that we needed to expand our efforts in the area of "Work Based Learning" and building  stronger relationships with the community. We need to increase the number of secured internships, job shadowing  opportunities and other career related opportunities for our students.    In terms of The Capacity Framework, the success of New Dorp has been built on a community effort, involving staff,  students, parents and the extended community supports. It is essential that we continue to build capacity by expanding  our efforts to utilize available resources, networking, and other opportunities to expose students to real-work  experiences.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67      As noted in the recent Quality Review, students, staff and parents feel welcomed in the family atmosphere,  communication is abundant, parents believe the work their children are doing is rigorous and is preparing them for  college, and that the school is clearly focused on preparing the students for college. It was stated, "It used to be that you  decided if you were going to go to college or not, now there isn't a choice." It was also mentioned that not every student  who was interviewed knew what they wanted to study in college or pursue as a career. We need to do a better job at  exposing them to different career paths so they do not waste time and money in college as they experiment and  investigate.   Clearly our work has been consistent, but a stronger focus would definitely serve our students well.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  A mandated percentage of the school budget is set aside to allow and encourage staff to pursue a highly qualified  status. In addition, conversations have taken place during feedback sessions to describe the options for furthering  teachers’ education and professional development. Our focus is to have teachers return to school to become dual  certified in a subject area and special education, subject area and ENL, or a subject area and CTE. Having dual licensed  teachers allows us to better meet the needs of the students as well as staff the special programs at our school.      Attendance at hiring fairs and strong collaboration with local college education programs has allowed us to improve  our HQT status with the NYS Department of Education. For example, at the present time, we have 41 dual licensed  special education teachers which allow us to staff a classroom with a teacher that is both content knowledgeable as  well as verse in special education strategies. We attend job fairs on a regular basis, work closely with the Affinity  Superintendents staff, communicate with the New Visions Teacher Recruitment program, collaborate and  communicate with our local colleges and universities and encourage our student teachers to aspire to be dual  licensed. During the 2017-18 school year, we participated in the DOE/CUNY collaborative Teaching Academy, allowing  collaborative teachers and student teachers to receive targeted PD to improve the development of soon to be new  teachers.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and  paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   On-going participation in Affinity Support Center professional development offerings, New Visions professional  development offerings, outside vendor staff development sessions, monthly on-site staff development, daily common  planning/collaboration, as well as weekly content area collaboration are the norm for the staff at New Dorp High  School. Teachers complete surveys that indicate their professional needs, they set annual goals for the academic year  and the information gathered from informal and formal observations, informs the planning and designing of the  appropriate professional development. Every staff member has been provided direct professional development in  terms of the Judith Hochman Writing Strategies with on-going support for the proper implementation of the skill  development in the content classrooms.

N/A        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     At New Dorp High School, teachers participate in an extensive inquiry process, where the assessment of student work  is a regular practice. Staff meets once a day in interdisciplinary grade level teams by SLC and they meet twice a week  by content area grade level teams. Utilizing this distributive teacher leadership model, staff create or make decisions  regarding the uniform assessments that are utilized across a grade level content areas. For example, the science  department utilizes common assessments every three weeks, where the Social Studies department utilizes weekly  review of student work and 4 uniform assessments for the school year. Grade leaders (teachers) organize and  facilitate this work. Every staff member has a voice in the decision making process at New Dorp and each will attest to  that. In reviewing data from the 2017-18 school year, 83.4%, of the staff received an "Effective" rating in "Use of  Assessments" (increase of 9.4% from 2016-17) and 14.4%% received "Highly Effective" (up 1.4% from 2016-17) for the  MOTP. The use of assessments will remain a priority for the 2018-19.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           85        Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           86      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. New Dorp High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.   New Dorp High School’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input.    Further review of data revealed the following comparison between 2016-17 and 2017-18   The chart below indicates the growth of parent engagement and communication using tools such as: social media,  website visits, PupilPath mass email, live streaming, phone messages and paper mail.

We will be offering homework and study support for our  5 most popular native language subgroups that account for 84% of our ELL population.  Those  languages being Spanish (34%), Arabic (16%), Chinese (15%), Russian (10%) and Albanian  (8%).  Since we currently only offer Freestanding ENL during the school day, these programs  will support our ENL students by providing them with direct supplemental instruction in their  native languages.  Each program will be ran by content teachers who are fluent in these  languages and will work collaboratively with an ENL teacher to help build literacy skills in both  English and the student's native language.  The staff will utilize the strategies within the Judith  Hochman Writing Revolution and Achieve3000 programs.  Studies show that literacy skills in  ELLs’ native languages strongly influence the ways in which ELLs' process linguistic  information in English.  The school ENL coordinator will be responsible for recruiting students, notifying parents,  maintaining attendance logs, and overseeing the program.  An administrator will also be present  to deal with any issues that may arise.  These programs will meet for twenty sessions throughout the school year.  Each session will  have an attendance page that will be signed by students and stored in the records of the Assistant  Principal of ENL's office.  Parents will be notified of these program offerings by mail sent home  in their preferred language if available.

Since we will be primarily using these resources in our Title III program, the more  familiar and adept our staff are in using these strategies the greater the amount of impact these  programs will have on our ELLs.  We expect to see the Lexile levels and writing skills of our  ELL participants increase as result.  Achieve3000 will continuously assess our students while  they use the program so it will provide us with immediate feedback and data.  New Dorp will also offer its staff ongoing professional development for the Judith Hochman  Writing Revolution throughout the year.  This will include a two full day trainings for all new  staff (led by Judith Hochman and her team) and access to our school's writing coach Christine  Varacalli.  Teachers have access to the writing coach during their planning periods, common  time meetings, and during the extended day schedule on Mondays and Tuesdays which are set  aside for professional developments and duties.   The Hochman Writing method teaches students  sentences strategies to build complexity and clarity to their writing.  It also incorporates outlines  to assist students in developing well-structured summaries, paragraphs, expository and  argumentative essays, and research papers.  Lastly, it aids students in revisions to enhance unity  and coherence.   These offerings are at no cost to the program.  Lastly, our staff who services/teaches the ELLs the most will discuss their academic and social  growth at small learning community common times.  Most of our ELLs are members of the  Corporate Center for Software Engineering and Virtual Enterprise. At these common time  meetings, staff discusses any issues students are having as well as sharing best practices.  They  are for one period (46 minutes) and are three times a week (Tuesday-Thursday).  Each professional development will have an attendance page and agenda that will be signed and  stored in the records of the Assistant Principal of ENL's office.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  New Dorp High School uses various assessments to guide instructional planning for our English Language Learners (ELLs).  To  monitor growth in our students writing skills, New Dorp High School utilizes the Judith Hochman Writing Revolution and its  strategies which are integrated into the curriculum of all of our courses, including physical education.  Teachers analyze       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                            104      student performance on these writing tasks and assessments to guide and impact future instructional planning.  Based off  these assessments, modifications are made to upcoming lessons where new skills are introduced or previous skills are re  taught.  The basic components of the program are sentence strategies to build complexity and clarity, outlines to develop well- structured summaries, paragraphs, expository and argumentative essays, and research papers.  The assessments  utilized include sentence activities (simple and complex), paragraph and multiple paragraph outlines, and essays.    To monitor the growth of the reading skills of our ELL population, New Dorp High School ENL teachers utilize the Achieve3000  reading program.  This program assesses students at their precise Lexile reading levels and then requires students to complete  assignments centered around non-fiction articles that are on their specific Lexile reading levels.  These tasks are aligned with  the Common Core Standards and include scaffolds and other language supports.     Furthermore,  informal methods of assessments are utilized. The San Diego Quick Assessment of Reading Ability is used as an  early screener to determine a students reading level by measuring their recognition of words out of  context.    Additionally, portfolios are used to assess student work throughout the entire year. With this method, teachers  systematically collect descriptive records of a variety of student work over time that reflects growth toward the achievement  of specific curricular objectives. Portfolios include information, sample work, and evaluations that serve as indicators for  student performance.  At the end of each marking period, students are given checklists to assess their growth and provided an  opportunity to reflect on their work.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   To support the instructional planning for our ELL population, our English as a New Language (ENL) staff meets daily in a  common planning period.  During this period, our ENL certified teachers, Ms. Roca, Ms. Sims Colangelo, Ms. Torres and Ms.  Piedra are able to collaborate, share best practices, plan instruction, and discuss the growth/struggles of our ELL students.  At  these meetings, they review baseline assessments and use inquiry models to determine next steps.  Furthermore, since the  majority of our ELL population are in the Corporate Center for Business and Technology smaller learning community, their core  content teachers also attend these meetings and discuss the academic performance/concerns of our ELL population.         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Analysis of New York State English as a Second Language Assessment Test (NYSESLAT) scores in each modality are used as a  baseline assessment at the start of every school year.  Based off these scores, the strengths and weaknesses of each student is  identified.  As the year develops, progress is measured in reading through the use of San Diego Quick Assessments and  Achieve3000, which requires students to periodically take a LevelSet assessment to re-measure their Lexile reading levels.    For writing,  the writing skills of our students are assessed at the end of each unit on class exams in ELA and Social  Studies.  Each unit exam requires students to complete either a Regents Thematic/DBQ essay or Common Core Enduring Issues  essay for Social Studies or an argumentative essay or a Text Analysis Response for ELA.  Grading rubrics are then used to  measure students progress and areas of need.  In between exams, teachers keep track of writing progress by assessing the  performance of students on daily writing activities in their writing workbooks that utilize Judith Hochman Writing Method  strategies.    Teachers also used the Data Driven Classroom (DDC) Exam Portal to assess the performance of our students on every class  exam.  We analyze data to see if there are any trends.  We check to see if there are certain subject-specific  content that students are not mastering  or if there was a certain type of question that our ELLs struggled with, like a political  cartoon or a stimulus based question.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                            105             4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Based off Achieve 3000 performance reports for each individual student, our ENL teachers then plan specific instructional  activities to address those students who may be struggling or not advancing.  Our ENL teachers utilize successful RtI  implementations which allow for small-group, teacher-led instruction that hone in on specific skills deficits. The Achieve3000  Classroom is designed for Tier II small group instruction or Tier III intensive one-to-one intervention and is fully equipped to  support instruction in reading comprehension, writing, vocabulary, fluency, and foundation skills.    Additionally, our teachers meet every Monday afternoon on inquiry teams during an 80 minute professional development  period to analyze summative assessments and data across grade and content levels.  During these meetings, teams plan  new instruction and activities to address the areas of need for our students.         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   New Dorp High School does not serve ELLs in grades  K-5.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   NYSESLAT and Regents scores are used to evaluate and inform our ELL program.  Utilizing the RLAT and EDAT reports, our ENL  teachers analyze the performance of our ELLs within each modality.  These reports enable our staff to measure the progress  and performance of each student within the reading, writing, speaking, and listening modalities.  We also look for trends  among certain subgroups and grade levels.  For our integrated courses. our collaborative pedagogues and administrators  analyze Regents score reports to measure the areas of strength and weaknesses.  The ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) allows us  to monitor achievement data of our ELLs and to identify trends and patterns that may exist among specific subgroups  or amongst individual students.   Based off this information, we then modify the curriculum for next year to address any areas  of concern.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Our ENL administrator, Deborah Cunningham and our ENL coordinator, Craig Simonetti share these results with our entire staff  in department meetings and through common planning times.  In the case of a new student, the results of a NYSITELL will be  shared with that students teachers through e-mail so they can make any necessary adjustments in their instruction.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                            106         At New Dorp High School, our ELL students are programmed according to the requirements in CR Part 154.2 and the  ELL Policy and Reference Guide.  For our standalone ENL classes, students are grouped by proficiency level.  These ENL  classes are for our Entering and Emerging ELLs.  The standalone classes are split by grade level.  One class is for 9th  and 10th graders.  The other is for the upper classmen.  Our integrated classes consist of a 9th grade Living  Environment class, two 10th grade Global III and IV classes, two 11th grade U.S. history classes, and two 12th grade  economic classes.  In these classes, a certified ENL teacher (Ms. Roca, Piedra, or Torres) push into the content class  each day to support our ELL population.  When applicable, students are  programmed homogeneously in these  courses.  We try to organize them by proficiency levels as measured by the most recent NYSESLAT  administration.  Additionally, we offer an integrated ENL/ELA class taught by Ms. Sims-Colangelo, who is both a  certified ENL and ELA teacher.  Her five classes are grouped by grade levels and then sub-grouped by proficiency  levels.  Lastly, those students who scored Commanding on the NYSESLAT within the last two years, receive a period a  day of integrated ENL support in the classes mentioned.  They are typically grouped with Expanding students of the  same grade level in those classes.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              In accordance with CR Part 154,  Entering-level ELLs are enrolled in three periods of ENL instruction per day for a total of  540 minutes (180 of which must be standalone).  Emerging ELLs are programmed for two periods per day of ENL instruction  (360 minutes per week), 90 of which must be in a standalone class and the other an integrated ELA class.  Transitioning and  Expanding ELLS receive at least one period of ENL instruction per week for a total of 180 minutes in an integrated ENL  class.  Lastly, Commanding ELLs will receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction a week in an integrated class.   This year our  integrated classes included Living Environment, Global History, Government and Economics, United States History, and English.  Since our classes are 45 minutes long on average, our students exceed the mandated number of instructional minutes at all  levels.  These minutes are routinely checked throughout the year using the date from the RLAT, Stars, monthly ELL Data  Reports, and checking individual student programs by our ENL coordinator and Deborah Cunningham, the assistant principal.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Our Freestanding ENL program supports content area instruction for our ELL students.  New Dorp High School offers push-in  integrated ENL history and science courses.  Our ENL and content teachers have access to Achieve3000, which is a  differentiated reading program that greatly enriches language development.  This program features articles at multiple Lexile  levels in English and Spanish.  Due to the plethora of I-Pad and laptop carts, in addition to numerous computer labs within our  building, staff and students have no issue accessing this service.  Students also use these devices for accessing translation  apps/sites.   Additionally, our entire school partakes in the Judith Hochman Writing Program and utilizes these activities in  their daily lessons. Our school’s writing program has been featured in The Atlantic magazine and begins with basic sentence  structure, slowly advances to paragraphs, then four-paragraph essays, and culminates with a research paper in senior  year.   Each writing task includes a rubric and numerous modeling activities to help focus the energies and processes of our  students. It is a writing process that incorporates explicit teaching of fundamental writing skills, emphasizes expository writing,  and focuses on sentence-level foundational strategies taught concurrently with paragraph and essay-level skills.  Teachers  model many of these skills and students work in small groups at times.  Students are often grouped/paired by language  proficiencies or native languages and work together to build skills.  Furthermore, to ensure content is comprehensible, each       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                            107      student has access to foreign language dictionaries to foster language development and focus on building student's academic  vocabulary.  Our library has many texts in different languages and many of the content textbooks also have translated  versions.  Lastly, the entire student population at New Dorp has access to World Book Online, which is an Encyclopedia and  primary source library that translates each text into over 20 languages.  This website also has a Spanish Encyclopedia program.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      New Dorp High School does not currently have a bilingual program.  The Spanish LAB is used as an assessment to gauge the  home language proficiency for all our native speaking Spanish newcomers.  Presently, 40% of our ELL population are native  Spanish speaking.  Translated Spanish, Russian, and Chinese Regents Exams are used as periodic assessments in the  corresponding Science, History, and Math classes.  These three languages account for 66% of our current ELL population.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    6.   We are proud to offer highly differentiated instruction to all levels and subgroups of our ELL population.  Our school  possesses significant amounts of technology.  All classrooms have interactive boards, document cameras and a class set of  interactive clickers which are excellent for assessment throughout a lesson. We also take advantage of computer-based  programs like Achieve3000 and Destination Math which helps our teachers differentiate and scaffold assignments and provide  bilingual (Spanish and English) support. Content is also differentiated through the World Book Online Encyclopedia, which  translates all of its content into over 20 languages. Through the SIFE grant and Title III funding we provide additional tutoring  that use ELL methodologies and intense Regents review.       a) Presently our SIFE population is very small.  Only 5 of our ELLs are SIFE students.  Instruction is differentiated for SIFE  students in a multitude of ways.  On Tuesday afternoons, our SIFE students can attend after school tutoring where they can  finish labs, use Achieve3000, work on reading and writing skills, learn calculator skills and receive personalized instruction in  content matter.  The usage of Achieve3000 is essential and occurs in all ENL classes.  This program helps close the achievement  gap.  It tailors readings to the students reading level and uses methodologies and activities which are aligned to the tenets of  Common Core to create highly differentiated instruction which targets areas of need and eliminates many of the language  barriers for students.  Achieve3000 constantly assesses students’ progress so teachers can deliver instruction where it is  needed most.  Achieve3000 is fully bilingual (Spanish and English) and provides native language support to a large population  of our ELL students.  SIFE students are paired (when possible) with students who speak the same native language to help them  adjust to school and to provide academic support in class.     b)  Newcomer ELLs are given the opportunity to take all content area Regents exams (except English) in their native language if  available.  They  use Achieve3000 which provides them with instruction in Spanish and English.  Most newcomer ELLs  (depending upon the NYSITELL assessment) are placed into integrated ENL history and science classes. This additional support  combined with intense Regents tutoring sessions offers our newcomer ELLs frequent help and personalized  instruction.  Students are also given access to the school WiFi to ensure they can utilize translation tools in all their  classes.  Also, when possible these students are paired with other students who share the same home language.     c)  New Dorp High School monitors our developing ELLs as a preventive measure in hope of preventing them from becoming  long-term ELLS.  Reading activities are differentiated using Achieve3000 and Destination Math helps measure students’  progress and gain problem-solving proficiency with step-by-step explicit instruction and audio support.  The Judith Hochman  Writing Revolution, which is a school-wide writing initiative, gives students a structure to help them formulate their own thesis  statements, organize supporting evidence, and then uses prescriptive writing strategies to construct well-organized and fluent       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                            108      writing samples.  These students are also strongly encouraged to take advantage of any tutoring sessions, whether its peer-to- peer or with a teacher, as well as the Saturday Regents tutoring.     d) Long-term ELLs are provided the same support as our SIFE students and newcomers.  Additionally, each long-term ELL is  paired with a teacher who serves as their mentor for the school year.  This teacher will work privately or with a small group of  students to build English reading and writing skills.    e) Former ELLS are invited and participate in all programs afforded to our current ELL population (including after-school and  supplemental tutoring).  Likewise, they receive testing accommodations and extended time for two years after they tested  proficient.   They are also programmed for 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction per week.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL students with IEPs are fully mainstreamed for ENL services, according to their level of proficiency.  These students are  programmed for self-contained or collaborative teaching monolingual classes for the rest of the school day.  Special education  teachers are given 10 hours of professional development through multi-media package entitled “Strategies for English  Language Learners.”  They are also offered the opportunity to attend QTEL trainings which teach content area teachers ESL  methodologies.  Furthermore, many special education teachers take advantage of the schools licenses with Achieve3000,  World Book Online and Destination Math--enabling special education teachers to differentiate readings and tailor instruction  to the individual needs of their ELL students. These programs also accelerate the English language development of our ELL  population.   Additionally, the Judith Hochman Writing Initiative is used in these classes. The Hochman method utilizes outlines  and graphic organizers and helps students analyze and break down grade-level and often above-grade level texts. by utilizing  annotation skills and underlining key facts.  Teachers model writing strategies and use explicit instruction to teach fundamental  writing skills which focus on sentence-level foundational strategies taught concurrently with paragraph and essay-level  skills.   Most of ELLS are programmed for a period of ENL which utilizes ELL methodologies to teach the English department  curriculum.  This allows the ELLS to read the same texts as the rest of the general education population.   We also provide 1:1  preferred language alternate placement paraprofessionals to those students who qualify based on psychoeducational  testing.  When mandated they received additional related services and testing accommodations.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  New Dorp High School has an extremely large special education staff, most of whom are dually licensed in special education  and a specific content area. New Dorp High School has self-contained and team teaching classes in all subjects, as well as  special education teacher support services (resource room/SETSS).   For additional support, ELL-SWDs can attend a period of  tutoring per week with a teacher and take advantage of the peer tutoring programs we run during lunch periods. All  curriculum at New Dorp High School are Common Core aligned and incorporates the Judith Hochman Writing Skills  program.  Furthermore, every classroom at New Dorp High School has an interactive board, document camera, and interactive  response clickers.  As a result, the vast learning needs and styles of our ELL-SWDs are met through highly differentiated  activities with significantly structured supports, interactive lessons, and prescriptive programs.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other content areas include daily articulation between content  area teachers, guidance counselors, administrators, and ESL teachers in our meetings of the small learning communities.  New  Dorp High School is divided into 8 smaller learning communities which are each led by an assistant principal and guidance  counselor.  Each house has its own set of teachers who meet on a daily basis to discuss any issues they may have with  students.  At these meetings, staff focuses on the specific needs of students and share best practices.  Professional       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                            109      development also occurs at these meetings.  ENL teachers share methodologies with content teachers to help them  differentiate learning activities for the ELLs in their classes.  As discussed earlier, our targeted interventions usually focus on  our flexible scheduling, tutoring services, and push-in/integrated class models.  In ELA, ELLs receive a license to use  Achieve3000.  All staff members are aware of this and can use the program to provide accessible texts to all ELL  subgroups.  Besides ELA teachers using this program to increase literacy skills and reading levels, social studies teachers assign  articles that provide enrichment to the curriculum.  This program is extremely helpful for our newcomers and Spanish  language students because it is a bilingual program. Likewise, in math, Destination Math is also a computer program that  students are able to use at home in Spanish and English.  All classroom instruction is delivered in English as we have  no bilingual programs at this time.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on Regents data and NYSESLAT trends, our goal for this upcoming school year is to create an ENL integrated Math class  and to continue to reduce the size of our ENL classes.  We are also looking to hire more Chinese speaking teachers as the  demographics of our community is changing.  We will also be adding homework support programs in Russian, Albanian,  Spanish, and Chinese.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   New Dorp High School has not had a bilingual program based off our parent survey and selection forms.  We still do not have  15 parents of students in the same grade and of the same language who desire a bilingual program.  Once we reach that  number, New Dorp High School will open that particular program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our ELLs are fully integrated with other students at New Dorp High School.  They are spread out through our 8 learning  communities.  They have access to all programs and services, just like any other student.  ELLs participate on all of our PSAL  athletic teams (especially soccer), in after-school clubs, as well as in our dramatic art programs, which includes but is not  limited to Sing, Glee Club, and the Black Box Theatre.  Many of our ELLs take advantage of our tutoring sessions and Saturday  School programs which provide free SAT tutoring and art classes.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  New Dorp High School utilizes a wide-range of instructional materials to support our ELLs.  As discussed earlier, we have  licenses with Achieve 3000, Destination Math, and World Book Online.  The entire school uses the Hochman  Writing Revolution program.  Our ENL staff also has access to the Heinle Reading Library, the R.I.G.O.R. program and a Kaplan  Regents Review program. Students also use I-Pads for translating classwork.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   New Dorp High School does not currently have a Dual Language or Transitional Bilingual program. In our English as a New  Language program, home language is assessed using the HLIS form and by the results of the Spanish Lab and  NYSITELL.   Students are provided home language support in a few ways.  They all have access to bilingual dictionaries for their  classes and exams.  On Regents, we use translated editions and one-to-one interpreters for less frequent languages.  Achieve  3000 and Destination Math are programs in English and Spanish.  Our World Book Online program contains a vast library of  articles and primary source documents that are translated into over 20 languages.  Students are also afforded the opportunity  to work with partners who share the same home language.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All our ELL students are placed in the same courses that our non-ELL population would receive.   They are members of our  small learning communities and with the exception of their ENL classes, are programmed for classes with the students in their  small learning communities cohort.  All of our ELLs are programmed for Regents courses and exams.   In each content, our       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                            110         teachers follow the same curriculum and use the same assessments with our ELLs as they do with general and special  education students.  To ensure the content is accessible to our ELL population, our staff uses scaffolding, differentiation,  modifications, and Hochman writing strategies.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    New Dorp High School is not a co-located school.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    Newly enrolled ELLs also attend freshman orientation with the rest of the incoming students.  During their first week they are  paired with a student who is of the same native language and serves as a mentor and helps them learn the layout of the  building, bell schedule, and other helpful information.  Lauren Tacconi, a guidance counselor and social worker, leads this  effort and ensures that this transition period is as smooth as possible for the new students.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    New Dorp High School offers Italian and Spanish to our ELL population.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   New Dorp High School does not presently have a dual language program.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  In order to build the capacity of the staff in meeting the needs of this population in the content classes, we use a multi-media  PD package entitled “Strategies for English Language Learners (Secondary Education) from Teacher’s Network Inc.  This was  purchased through the 2010-11 SIFE/LTE grant.  We will schedule a 10 hour staff development program for 14 teachers  throughout the content areas.  The multimedia program will serve as the basis for the PD whereas teachers will create a binder  of strategies and activities related to the common core to be utilized in the content area classes to differentiate instruction for  the LTE’s and SIFE students.  Staff members will present these strategies and created materials at department meetings  throughout the year.  The goal is to create a binder or guide with on-line materials, academic vocabulary strategies,  enhancements to the Judith Hochman work (specific to this population), and literacy practices that can be infused into existing  curriculum utilizing the common core standards.  In addition to the new components of PD, we will continue to utilize the professional development which is provided to us by  Achieve 3000 contract.  In this professional development package, Achieve3000 sends a coach to our school for two full school  days to train teachers in the methodology of the program and to analyze student progress and address any questions they may  have.   We will also be offering the professional development, Addressing the Needs of the English Language Learner, to thirty of our       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                            111         staff members who service our SIFE and LTE students.  This workshop will give school leaders and teachers a clear  understanding of the diverse instructional needs of the English language learners by looking at students at different language  proficiency levels and differentiate instruction to address the needs in the four language domains.   School staff will be  engaged in strategically planning evaluations which will help identify specific teachers’ strengths and weaknesses in teaching  ELLs. As a result, teachers will be able to provide students with learning strategies that will promote student  achievement.  These strategies will address the needs of all English Language learners, including Special Education and gifted  students.  Our teachers who have English Language Learners attend many of the professional developments offered by the Office of  English Language Learners throughout the year.  These workshops have focused on the Collaborative Strategic Reading  Approach, Vocabulary Development, Reading Comprehension, and strategies for the English Regents.  Lastly, our entire staff receives ongoing professional development by the Hochman Writing Revolution staff and our school's  writing coach.  These professional developments are ongoing and are typically scheduled for staff professional development  days or after school on Monday during the time set aside for professional development.  Our ENL teachers are forwarded the Office of English Language Learners professional development offerings e- mail.  They  attend workshops and web conferences which focus on differentiation, scaffolding, building academic vocabulary  and increasing text complexity.  Judith Hochman also provides our staff with professional development for her writing  strategies biannually.   Achieve3000 also provides our staff with biannual professional development.  Achieve 3000 offers  lessons that specifically address  Common Core standards.   All these trainings specifically important educational shifts noted in  the Common Core, particularly the Hochman Writing program which focuses on creating evidence based arguments  and the  deep reading of texts.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our staff regularly attends professional developments offered by the Office of English Language Learners, the Staten Island  Field Center, the Judith Hochman Writing Revolution, Achieve3000, and at NYU.  During our extended school day professional  development sessions, staff work with administrators and colleagues to review best practices and analyze student work.  At  these sessions, any new strategies learned at professional developments offered outside of our school are turn keyed to the  staff,  All new teachers attend a professional development program conducted by the Hochman Writing Revolution throughout  their first few years.  Ongoing development is conducted to our more senior staff by our school's writing coach.  This regular  and consistent professional developments ensure that all staff receive 12.5% of their professional development in ENL  methodology and that our ENL staff receive at least 50% of those hours as such.  Teachers maintain a folder/binder of all the  agendas and materials from any professional development that they attend.  Attendance records from all in-school  professional developments are kept in the offices of the respective school administrators.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   On Tuesday's throughout the school year, during our school's professional period (2:20-3:35), our ENL teachers invite parents  to meet with them and review their child's portfolios, classwork, and assessments.  An attendance of these meetings are kept  in the yearly ENL binder.  Furthermore, teachers utilize a circular 6 period on Mondays and Fridays to call parents or to  communicate through Pupilpath.  All contacts are kept in a students anecdotal log.  Qualified interpretors/translators are       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                            112            provided or the DOE Translation Hotline is utilized to conduct these meetings in the language or mode of communication that  the parent/guardian best understands.  Pupilpath also provides automatic translation resources for certain school documents.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Our ELL parents are encouraged to attend PTA meetings and our open school nights and parent-teacher  conferences.  Additionally, we conduct an extra parent meeting for our ELL parents.  Each parent is invited to school for a  private meeting with an ELL teacher.  Students progress and any parental concerns are discussed at this meeting.  Parents are  also able to request a meeting by phone if preferred.  Lastly, our school hosts an annual International Festival where our ELLs  and other students put on performances and share their culture with our school community.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Deirdre Deangelis, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                            114                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   New Dorp High School                                                                              School DBN: R31440  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In case of a school emergency, our school has assembled a language inventory of all our staff members. This enables  us to be prompt in relaying information if an emergency shall occur involving a student or family that have limited- English proficiency. If a case arises with a language that may not be spoken by anyone on our staff, members of our  school emergency response team (as well as the entire staff) are trained on how to utilize the NYC DOE Translation  and Interpretation Units over-the-phone interpretation services.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      In our first staff meeting of the school year, our principal reviews the key points and changes to Chancellor's  Regulation A-663 with the entire staff. Furthermore the entire staff is e-mailed a copy of the A-663 memo and          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                            119      information on how to access all the services provided by the NYC Department of Education Translation and  Interpretation Unit. Staff are also informed of the procedure for updating and sharing parents preferred language  needs.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      We provide each parent whose primary language is a covered language with a print out of the Parent Bill of Rights in  their native language (by mail) which informs them of their rights regarding translation and interpretation services in  the appropriate covered language with instructions on how to obtain such services.      We clearly post signs translated in the covered languages at our front entrance informing parents of the translation  services available to them. These signs include the multilingual Welcome Poster. All staff members received a copy of  the language identification cards. These cards and posters are displayed in the key offices and entry points of our  school to allow our staff to quickly identify any language needs of our limited-English Proficient parents. Our staff also  receives the informational brochure and e-mails on how to access over-the-phone interpreters and other translation  services provided by the NYC Department of Education Translation and Interpretation Unit.      Our safety plan affords all parents, regardless of language, access to our administrative offices. This is done through  on-site translation provided by staff &/or DOE Translation hotline.         Through phone blasts, letters home, and Skedula messages, parents are also informed of the Parent Portal on the NYC  DOE website and how to translate the website into one of the covered languages.      Additonally, Skedula affords our staff the opportunity to translate messages sent to parents.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                            120      Surveys will be distributed to parents by the guidance counselors of each of our smaller learning communities  accessing the satisfaction of our parents with their language needs and requesting feedback on any areas where we  could improve. We have used this information in the past to provide bilingual staff members at PTA meetings and IEP  meetings.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                            121
