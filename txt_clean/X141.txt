This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our Mission Statement:   Section 4: CEP Overview      The David A. Stein Riverdale Kingsbridge Academy, also known as MS / HS 141, is committed to providing a rigorous  curriculum in a community-based environment. We offer a comprehensive liberal arts and science program that  exceeds New York State and Common Core standards and takes advantage of the rapidly expanding technological  opportunities of the Information Age.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      We seek to create an atmosphere that will challenge each individual student to become a creative, independent.  critical thinker and foster a life-long love of learning. We encourage students to accept the risks and rigor of academic  life in order to achieve mastery in a variety of disciplines including intellectual, artistic, physical, moral, and emotional  development.       ________________________________________________________________________________                        2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    As a six through twelve college preparatory school, the Riverdale Kingsbridge Academy provides students with the  skills needed to achieve their potential through a variety of learning styles, and demonstrate mastery on standardized  and performance assessment. The middle school component will prepare students for the demands of a rigorous high  school education. The high school component will offer students a viable alternative to selective high schools  throughout the city. The school will offer maximum opportunities for enrollment in accelerated courses.   The David A. Stein Riverdale Kingsbridge Academy reflects and celebrates the diversity of the community it serves.  Toward this end, we seek partnerships with local institutions including our colleagues in academia. At the center of  this collaborative effort are our teaching staff and administrators, the educational professionals who lead our  children, parents, and community in the quest to nurture and strengthen local education.   Our students can engage in many types of activities and clubs such as 13 PSAL Varsity teams plus cheerleading, 4-5 MS  sports programs, and after school clubs such as Science Olympiad. We have extra-curricular offerings too such as  student government, Mission I’mPossible, Teen Theatre, Honor Society, dances, trips, and pep rallies and special  assemblies. Our school’s art program is presented in our Winter and Spring Arts Festival and the students perform in  our Talent Show each spring.       As a MS/HS which spans 7 years of adolescent growth, our guidance department offers extensive services. We have  guidance counselors dedicated to academic programming which ensures that students receive the most rigorous  program possible placing them in a prime position for the college application process. Students participate in  assemblies, lunch bunches, guidance groups, one on one planning sessions, and in-class lessons as they explore  colleges and careers. In addition we provide counseling services for students through three dedicated social workers  and a Substance Abuse Prevention and Intervention Specialist. RKA students also get involved by earning Tiger Tokens  through our PBIS program called Tiger PRIDE. PRIDE stands for Punctuality, Respect, Independence, Determination,  and Enthusiasm. We feel that these character traits lead to positive academic and social/emotional growth.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Our parents are very involved, and our commitment to our role as the local school of choice drives many of the  activities in which we engage. We are in constant communication with our feeder schools regarding articulation and  transitioning of students to our school as well as identifying ways in which our students can support the feeder  schools. One thing that our staff, parents and students value about our school is the community. Most students  attend RKA for 7 years and experience a wide variety of activities and opportunities. Having a zoned admission policy  for the MS ensures that many students have siblings and relatives who also attend the school. Similarly, many parents  attended this school as it has long standing roots in the community. Our staff is relatively steady often coaching or  working in our after school program as well as teaching during the day. Many staff also live locally. This intimate  familiar feel is one which leaves students feeling socially responsible and a part of the larger community.       Our closest community partner is the Riverdale Community Center. For over 47 years, their offices and program have  been located in the school. They offer an extensive after school program attended by nearly 200 MS students. They  also offer clubs and extra-curricular activities to the HS students. Their Tuesday evening and Saturday morning  programs engage local residents as well.       We have partnerships with other local institutions such as Thrive Collective, Counseling in Schools, Mosaic Mental  Health, Wave Hill Community Garden, Riverdale Y, NYPL, Riverdale Mental Health Association, College of Mount St.  Vincent, 92 St Y, 50th Precinct NYPD Explorers Program, and Fieldston School for Ethical Culture.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   RKA (MS/HS) is a community school serving nearly 1,400 students in grade 6-12. Our middle school serves students  who reside within our geographical catchment. The vast majority of students completing grade 8 articulate with us to  high school. Any new members of the student body joining our school in grade 9 or later must meet minimum  screening requirements.   Students in our school are programmed according to their individual talents and abilities. This means that eligible  students experience courses offered at the general education level, honors level, Advanced Placement level or  Regents level as determined by our guidelines. Many students in 8th grade have the opportunity to take Regents level  courses which affords them the opportunity to amass HS credit prior to starting 9th grade. Offering 8 or 9 Advanced  Placement or Dual Enrollment courses each year also provides students the potential to earn college transferable  credit while in HS.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Goal #3-One area where we made impressive gains last year was in our Common Planning periods. This was a huge  change for the school and a celebrated area of success during our School Quality Review. Teachers used their Circular  6 time to meet in collaborative teams (as departments , as co-teachers, with support staff). Staff discussed lesson  planning, curriculum and other pedagogical issues. Meetings were tracked using Google Drive. In sum, staff were able  to learn from one another and share best practices.       Goal #1- Another area of success was the inclusion of 3 or more significant samples of student work into our student  work folders. Every major subject area maintained a folder system and included at least three pieces there.

The existing partnerships that were  developed and enhanced this year include Mosaic Mental Health (Mental Health Services), Teacher Center Initiatives  (mentoring), College of Mount St. Vincent (Dual Enrollment), Manhattan College (teacher prep), extensive library  programming (History Day), and Riverdale Community Center of RNH (enrichment programming). The new  partnerships include Kiwanis Club (service), Mindset Works (Growth Mindset), Thrive Collective (Arts and Media),  College Access for All MS, Creative Arts Team at Lehman College (SEL). Already we expect the following year will also  include partnerships with College Access for all HS, One Goal, and Teacher Career Pathways (providing 4 Model  Teachers).       In the upcoming school year, our Instructional Focus will be "If Learning Targets for units and lessons are clearly  understood by both teachers and students, then delivery of instruction, students' work pieces, learning activities and  assessment (formative and summative) will become more aligned and effective in meeting grade-level standards."               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 10X141   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08,09,10,11,1 2   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1513   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Teachers are very willing to help one another and work together to improve student outcomes, but they rarely see  one another in action. Although we made tremendous strides in Common Planning, some growth is still needed in  teacher inter-visitations.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Riverdale Kingsbridge Academy MS/HS 141, in compliance with the Section  1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       Riverdale Kingsbridge Academy MS/HS 141 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

This group has had a  much lower rate of students reaching the commanding level  on the NYSESLAT than our newer  ELLS.  In addition, our long-term ENLs also continue to struggle on the required NYS Regents  exams especially the English, US and Global History.  During the past few years we have begun  to see an increase in the number of newly arrived ENLs at our school.  These newly arrived  students are making more progress at a quicker rate than our long-term students.  Although our  overall NYSESLAT scores showed improvement our long-term ENLs continue to remain  stagnant.  Our supplemental instructional program for students in grades 6-8 will be led by ELL  and special education teachers two days a week, and it is designed to support language  development, build vocabulary, reading and writing skills.  These students will be assigned  according to their most recent ELA and math assessment including the NYS test scores. ELL  students are programmed for the supplemental instructional program and are grouped according  to progression level and/or years of service.  The program will run from January 8,  2019 to April  30, 2019.  Our supplemental instructional program meets in one of the following out-of-school  time schedules:  Before and After School:  All programs are co-taught with one ENL/Bil teacher and 1 content-area teacher.  Co-planning  occurs during prep time.  Wednesdays from 7:20-8:20 (before school) and Thursdays from 2:40-3:40 (after school)  ELL  students are placed in a class with both a bilingual and a special education teacher who will co- teach.  Students will be using Scholastic books and on-line books.  2 Teachers/1 hr a day/2 days per week/for 13 weeks = 52 hrs (26 hrs before school and 26 hours  after school)   An ENL teacher will be instructing a group on Wednesdays from 2:40-3:40 (after school) and  Thursdays from 7:20-8:20 (before school).    1 Teacher/1 hrs a day/2 days per week/ for 13 weeks = 26 hours (13 hrs before school and 13 hrs  after school)  Total 78 hours instructional   Our school-wide data continues to show that our HS ELL students struggle with both credit  accumulation and Regents exams; these are key components that prevent students from  graduating.  In addition, our long-term ENLs struggle more than our more newly arrived  ENLs.  In order to increase graduation rates for our long term ENLs we are now offering Content  Area Support after school staffed by a content area teacher who works in collaboration with a  licensed ENL teacher to remediate students in key skills so that they can complete their  homework and/or long term projects independently because homework completion is a key  factor in credit accumulation.  This is offered by one assigned teacher for one hour, two days a  week from February 4 to May 28, 2019.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   1 teacher/ 1 hour a day/ 2 days a week/ 14 weeks= 28 hours  A Regents Prep program is offered to ELL students for Common Core Algebra, Global History,  and ELA; the areas where our ELL students most struggle thus preventing them from  graduating.   It is offered 2 times a week (Monday from 4-6 pm afterschool and Saturday 9:30- 11:30 AM) for 2 hours a day 4 weeks prior to the June Regents testing period (5/13/19-6/15/19)-  no meeting Memorial Day weekend).  This co-taught  by a licensed ESL teacher with the support  of a content area teacher.  This does not conflict with Monday PD time as PD time is 2:40 to  4:00 PM.

One program we are using is the SRI on-line  assessment for all of our ELLs.  Part of this program is professional development provided by  Scholastic.  This PD will be provided for our ELL teachers and selected content area teachers  who are working in the after and before school program  Topics covered during these PD  sessions has or will include: Information available after the assessment, What does the Lexile  measure really mean?, What materials should be available in the classroom to assist students at  the various Lexile levels?, How can content area teachers use the assessment to group  students?     Another program that we are fully implementing this year is the English 3D program.  This  program is specifically targeted towards long-term ELLs who are at the Intermediate or  Advanced level.  This is a group that we have struggled with for the past few years.  Both our  ELL teachers and a select group of English Language Arts teachers who are working in the  before and after school program have received multi-day PD in how to best implement this  program.  This program is being supplemented in the ESL class by teacher-designed lessons that  support content-area units. For our ELLs who are at the Beginner level they are using the  Milestones program which directly supports students' work with the Code X program that is used  in English classes throughout our school.  Again, this PD is being offered by  Scholastic.  Program costs a total of $2,500.  During the PD time that is provided on Mondays by the new teacher’s contract (and will not be  supported by Title III, we devote one Monday a month to ELL specific topics.  Groups of  teachers are looking at the model ELL units available on the OELL DOE page and trying to  design classroom lessons that will better support ELLS.    Teachers are provided with PD  designed to assist content area teachers with making sure their lessons are accessible to ELLs,  teachers are looking at student work and developing strategies to better assess the work produced  by ELL students.

Notices  about important/upcoming parent events, including PA meetings and workshops, are sent home  in English, Spanish and other languages as needed.    We provide translation services (in  Spanish) at PA meetings and make use of on-site and/or phone translation services for individual  conferences with teachers and other school personnel.  Notes are sent home in alternate  languages to inform parents of the availability of translators at these events.  We also translate  important documents into home languages based on information available in ATS.   Parent  workshops designed for and targeted towards the parents of ELL students are held before and  after school on the last Wednesday of the month (9/26/18, 10/30/18 (Tuesday), 11/  28/18,  12/19/18, 1/30/18, 2/27/ 18, 3/ 27/18, 4/17/18, 5/29/18).  They are held from 3:00 to 5:00  PM.  Some of the topics scheduled include:  HS Graduation Requirements,   The College  Application Process, What does the CCLS Really Mean?  How can I help my child acquire  English skills?, What resources are available within our community?,  Educationally Helpful  Websites, What is the NYSESLAT? And How can I help my child prepare for Regents  exams?.   Notices are sent home via email and written notices given to the children in their ENL  classes.  The notices are always in English and Spanish as well as other languages when  appropriate.  We have interpreters available at parent workshops so that parents can fully  participate and ask questions.    These workshops are led by our guidance and administrative  staff as well as experts on a specific topic including admission counselors and financial aid  experts from CUNY and SUNY.  Consultants provided at no cost.   We have a very strong partnership with our Community Based Organization, the Riverdale  Community Center.  Through this partnership we are able to offer literacy classes to ELL  parents. These classes are offered on Tuesday evenings and Saturday mornings during two 10- week sessions each year.  (Oct-Dec and March-June).  The instructor is a licensed English  teacher and child care is provided.    We have staff members that speak a variety of languages including French, Spanish, Greek,  Tagalog, Portuguese, Hebrew, Patois and Japanese.  These staff members act as translators  whenever needed for both spoken and written communication.     Our bilingual social worker and  School-Based Support Team also assist with translation as needed.  When necessary, we reach  out to the Department of Education's Translation Services to provide translation into other  languages.

Our ELL students showcase work done in ENL classes and  work completed during content classes.  We match our parent involvement activities to parents’  expressed needs and requests.  The main thing that parents ask for is curriculum information  or/or the opportunity to meet with individual  teachers, so each year we structure our Parent  Workshops to meet the needs of the current parents.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use the Scholoastic SRI and NYC Performance tasks to assess literacy skills for our ELLs.  The data we have shows that many  of our new ELLs have reading comprehension skills that are at least 3 years below grade level.  Many of our long term ELLs  have lexile levels that are below grade level and as a result we are using more lexile leveled texts within subject are classes in  order to provide multiple entry points for our ELLS.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Our ENL teachers co-plan with their subject area partners to better understand the key points of the lesson  and provide leveled or translated version of the texts necessary for comprehending key pieces.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         We evaluate our programs success by looking at how many of our students improve their performance on the NYSESLAT, and  the NYSED ELA and Math exams.   We look at how our ELLs do in comparison to other subgroups and the student body as a  whole.  For our high school students we examine Regents data.  17% of our ELLs scored proficient on the Spring 2013  NYSESLAT and another 17% moved up a level.  Even with these results we recognize that we would like to see greater growth  among our ELLs and are currently looking into what additional programs and materials we can use to support our ELLs as we  move them toward CCLS proficiency.  We recently purchased English 3D from Scholastic and our ESL teachers will be getting  training that they will turnkey to other staff.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We communicate findings to RCC- our after school provider - in order to impact the work they do with students afterschool     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   We do not have any students in grades K-5.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Although 25% of our students scored Commanding (Proficient)on the 2017 NYSESLAT and another 20% moved up a full level,  we realize that our students need more reading and writing support.  Our long term ELLs consistantly score at the advanced  level on the NYSESLAT but do not move beyond that within the next 2 years.  Our HS ELLs score Proficient on the NYSESLAT at  a lower rate than our MS ELLs, this difference does not correlate to years of service.   Our students consistantly perform higher  in listening/speaking than in reading/writing.  This same pattern in seen on the LAB-R data.  Based on the Spanish Lab-R data  we are able to see that about 50% our newly arrived Spanish speaking ELLs do significantly better on the Spanish Lab-R than on  the English Lab-R.  By analysing the patterns and trends across grade and proficiency levels we can see that certain grades, 8th  in particular, need more support in the subject area classrooms in addition to ESL.  We arrange time for the ESL teachers to  meet with the subject area teachers to help plan lessons that will enable all students to access material being taught and to  gain greater competence in CCLLS tasks.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Teachers plan in common planning meetings.  They review data and communicate with supervisors about proposed changes to  curricula and programs.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   We offer two types of services: Integrated  and Standalone ENL.   In the integrated model students receive their  services within core content classes that are cotaught by a content area teacehr sna a licensed ELL  teacher.   Stanalone services are provided in a smaller setting with students receiving language instruction and  services from a licensed ELL teacher.  For both the standalone and integrated model, the students receive services  according to the Part 154 requirements.  Students are individiually programmed and do not travel as a group.  The  standalone class is ungraded and homogeneous.  The integrated classes are heterogeneously mixed.        b.  TBE program.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Students are programmed based on their NYSITELL levels.  They are homogeneously grouped together then placed into  heterogenous clases.  The idea is to consolodate the number of minutes of integrated instruction being provided.   Teacher  programs are then designed around integrating services within a similar class each week.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Core content is delivered in each program model through the use of push in instructors. So, ELLs receive support in their  content classes (such as Social Studies, for example).  Our seciond Professional Learning Cycle, led by our ELL AP Instruction  conveys strategies and resources to all teachers.  Strategies like "fishbowl," think-pair-share, and previewing vocabulary are  used with all students, and leveled questions are used for ELLs.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      We use several translation applications such as Google Translation to translate class tests.  In addition, we order state tests in  students home languages whenever possible.   We also use translated versions of previous Regents exams for HS classes.  We use the Translation and interpretation services unit time permitting       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.

How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  All students receive an individualized program providing for LRE, ELL services are provided in the same manner as to all ELL.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our targeted intervention program includes our extended day programs.  We offer extended day ESL classes for students who  need more language support in reading and writing and classes for students who need more subject area support.  We also  offer push-in ESL support in Math during this time.  We offer The ESL teacher works with the Social; tudies and Science  teachers as they unti plan to ensure that content areaknowledge will be accessible to all students.  the ESL teachers work with  subject area teachers and instructional leaders to  better assist our ELLS with mastering content needed for CCLS tasks and  exams.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We recently purchased English 3d to help support our ELLs.  We review our student pass rate in subject area classes and  provide more push-in service as needed .  Our ELLs' poor results on Regents exams leads up towrd more push-im services in  the HS.  That is something we are working on going forward.  We are regualrly evaluating our enrollment information to see if  we need to open a bilingual bridge class in our Middle School       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None of our programs are scheduled to be discontinued.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLS are offered all activites within our school including our afterschool program through our CBO.  We send home notices  aboout extra curricular activites such as trips in multiple languages.  Our CBO offers programs designed for ELL students and  parenst on Saturdays and Evenings.           12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Smartboards are available for use in all classrooms.  Teachers are invited to use the new computer lab to access different  materials with a whole class or a group of students.   Computers, with headsets for read aloud,  are available as well.  We order  subject area textbooks in alternate languages where needed and available.  STudents are given access to on-line native  language textbook where available      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   WIth in the ENL class the teachers have books in native languages paired with books in English.  This allows the student to  learn English while gaining content in the native language.  Special celebrations are planned to celebrate the students'  heritage.  parents are invited in for special events.  Speakers visit the classrooms often times speaking in the predominant  native language.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All of our ELL classes use age appropriate, high interest instructional materials.  We have separate classes for middle school  ELLs and high school ELLs   In the MS the focus is on language acquisition.  AS the students move into the upper grades more  focus is given to specific contact area knowledge.  HS classes support the devlopment of knowledge that is required for  students on exams required for HS graduation       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Smartboards are available for use in all classrooms.  Teachers are invited to use the new computer lab to access different  materials with a whole class or a group of students.   Computers, with headsets for read aloud,  are available as well.  We order  subject area textbooks in alternate languages where needed and available.

ELL teachers are offered PD outside of the school through BFSC.  In addition they participate in all of the Professional Learning  Cycles implemented at the school.  Titles of intended cycles include Effective Rubric Use, Using ELL Strategies in the Classroom,  Integrating Instruction (models for team teaching SWD and ELLs).    Content area personnel are offered PD outside of the school through BFSC including such workshops as "Writing Across ALL  Subjects.

Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   Since we are a 6-12 school we assist students with the transition from middle school to high school.  We work with students so  that they gain credits while improving their second language skills. Our HS and MS guidance staff work closly together to  ensure a smooth transition.  Whenever possible our students remain with the same ESL teacher as the move to HS.    Teachers are invited to attend any appropriate PD offered by OELL and District 10.  Teachers that attend training then turnkey  information at subject, grade or staff conferences.  One professional Learning Unit of 6 is devoted to improving ELL  instruction.  1 of 6 = 15% for all teachers.  For ELL teachers we supplement the 15% with off site PD offered through BFSC  1   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         day per month to make 50%.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Riverdale Kingsbridge Academy                                                                              School DBN: 10x141  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
