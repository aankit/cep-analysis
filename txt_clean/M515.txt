This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our mission: We are all engaged in learning. To this end, there is clear communication that includes the evolving use  of questioning and discussion techniques. Learning activities and assignments are engaging because they are  academically rigorous and inherently interesting. We all grow and learn through assessment of and reflection on our  work. We all demonstrate adaptability in contributing to the success of each lesson, each student, and each other.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Lower East Side Prep is a Title I, transitional bilingual transfer high school. Eighty-one percent of our student  population - ages 17-21 years old- are recent immigrants and English language learners. The majority (52.5%) of our  English language learners come from countries where Chinese languages are spoken. Our program continues to  experience a significant increase in the number of Spanish-speaking students seeking English as a New Language (ENL)  instruction - currently 20.16 % of our student population. Our Spanish-speaking English language learners come  mostly, although not exclusively, from the Dominican Republic. Home languages of our other English language  learners include Tibetan, Vietnamese, Arabic, French, French-Haitian Creole, Bengali, Albanian, Amoy, Burmese, Thai,  Russian, and Turkish.    Our intended outcome is to prepare all of our students with the language skills, cognitive skills, and content  knowledge that will equip them for successful entry into post-secondary schooling and/or work environment.    There has been a gradual release of information, control and access to teachers, parents and students as they utilize  Skedula, participate in professional development planning and delivery. Teachers have a hand in shaping the  parameters in which they are making choices in the system. We are able to trust the teachers based upon greater  belief on what they do. Who better to identify their needs and gaps? It’s a continuing dialogue that holds everyone  involved accountable and everyone has a voice.    Instructionally, Advance has given greater effectiveness and resulted in a greater belief and feeling of we can  facilitate, there is more trust and greater collaboration. Let’s talk about what we do, what we practice. The  instructional shift to Advance has given a common language and supports a greater focus on practice.    Our challenges include keeping staff in the loop from initial intake throughout the students’ time at LESP. Our  challenge is to give students opportunities to share in the ownership of our school, while making them safe, learning  about different cultures and growing within each of them a need to be a life-long learner.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   As our population changes and evolves as a result of immigration patterns and knowledge about our school, cultural  and philosophical shifts are formed as we strive to meet the needs of new populations. There is an implicit need for  teachers to develop new skills in order to work with different types of students who bring different histories,  experiences and cultures. As a result, the role of teacher has expanded into areas of guidance and support. Teachers  have new tools to communicate with parents, counselors, administrators and students through the use of Skedula  and Pupilpath. They have a means of sharing anecdotals about students’ progress and areas in need of improvement.  As a result of this, we, as an administration, and as a school are more proactive. We are made aware of situations that  need to be addressed and we act upon them immediately, and in real time. Students can now examine their own  behaviors and be directly involved in solutions.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) goals are aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. We have made  significant progress in the following areas: 1. Collaboration Teaching, teachers participate in opportunities to develop,  grow and contribute to school improvement; 2. Supportive Environment, the addition of a certified, full time social  worker has enhanced our student centered, guidance approach and address individual and familial student issues; 3.  Effective School Leadership, our administrative team fosters professional growth by sending teachers and  administrators to various professional conferences including the Association of Supervision and Curriculum  Development (A.S.C.D.), the Harvard School of Education, and Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages  (T.E.S.O.L.) and relevant subject specific conferences. Our cabinet is made up of several staff representing various  areas of focus.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         Many of our students demonstrate limited literacy in their native languages and, as a result, encounter difficulty in  the acquisition of academic English. In addition to the challenges involved in immigrating to a large American city and  negotiating a new academic system in a new language, many of our students also report economic and care-taking  responsibilities after school.      Nearly 74% of our students passed the New York State Common Core English Regents Exam in 2016-17, and the vast  majority (73%) of our students applied to college. A 7% increase over the 2015-16 school year. In 2014-2015, we were  ranked number one out of 47 transfer high schools in New York City according to U.S. News and World Report.      Approximately 44% of students who attend LESP are considered Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE).  However, because of the demographic profile of our typical student (i.e. over-age, under-credited, recently  immigrated English language learner) we believe the true percentage of SIFE enrolled at LESP is in fact much greater  than that which students themselves report to us at intake. For this reason, the instructional focus for all staff and  students at our school necessarily addresses and integrates both the academic literacy skills that are considered best  teaching practices for ENLs and support of the academic and personal behaviors that are often reserved for students  having had interrupted formal education.      Additionally, our teachers and administrators consistently identify four learning trends among many LESP students,  and particularly among those who have been positively identified with interrupted formal education: our SIFE/ ENLs  respond positively to small group learning environments, expeditionary learning activities, extended task-time and  multiple opportunities to practice skills.      SIFE students at LESP report that smaller group settings in which “real life experiences” generate multiple  opportunities to practice listening, speaking, reading, and writing make the experience of school “more personal and  meaningful.”      2. Designs for Learning (D4L) is a weekly, teacher-led professional development experience (4 sessions per month/80  minutes each) in which groups of LESP teachers work collaboratively to deepen their understanding of the best  instructional practices for working with our students. In D4L teachers address a menu of focus topics, designed to  support our work with the Common Core Learning Standards, Advance (teacher evaluation system) and the New York  City Framework for Great Schools. The focus topics this year include:   Engaging Learners Through Critical Thinking Questions     Knowing Your Students/Data-Driven Decision Making/Using Learner Work to Inform Instruction    Engaging Learners Through Critical Thinking Discussions    Establishing an Emotionally Supportive Classroom Culture      Assessing Learning Throughout the Learning Cycle   Supporting Learner Literacy Across the Content Areas   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      In their D4L groups, teachers engage in protocol-based discussions of professional articles related to each focus topic.  Teacher groups also use protocols to analyze authentic teaching artifacts and to examine student work. At the end of  each cycle, teachers submit a teaching artifact that demonstrates how they have incorporated their understanding of  the topic into their instructional practice. The discussions, artifacts and student work that result from each D4L cycle  directly inform the work of our Professional Learning Committee.      We strive to create a supportive environment that gives students more access to guidance. We have maintained a  good guidance to student ratio, giving counselors more manageable caseloads. We have brought in graduate interns  to assist; information about students is shared through the use of Skedula. Students seek out or are directed to our  Substance Abuse Prevention and Intervention Specialists (S.A.P.I.S.) counselor and Social work interns. All staff has  received resiliency training, and we effectively use of attendance outreach team to bring students back to school.      3. There has been growth in teacher innovation and initiative. Teachers take ownership in key areas in developing and  participating in high quality professional development. Professional journals exhibit the depths of teacher thinking, as  they reflect on the combination of theory and practice, as well as student outcomes. The level of thoughtfulness  becomes clearer as more voices join the discussion, and a level of trust has evolved evidenced by the teachers’  willingness to share.      The changes in our population are reflected in the diversity of the honor roll, with increased numbers of students  representing a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Over the past fifteen years we have developed high quality and rigorous  after school programs that have given students the opportunity to challenge themselves as they earn credits toward  graduation. Students’ activities including robotics and Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) sports help to build school  community. Social gatherings like the thanksgiving dinner serving some 300 students, the talent show and welcoming  activities for new students build foundations for students and teachers to gain an understanding of one another and  develop trust. Teachers understand their role in identifying at-risk students and all students and addressing their  needs. Admitting surveys to assess student needs, interest and possible interventions.                   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 01M515   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   557   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

According to our most recent Quality Review (2014-2015) we earned "Well Developed" in the areas of Teacher teams  and leadership development, Curriculum, Assessment, and High Expectations. We earned a proficient in pedagogy. As  a result of this proficient we have focused our efforts on having teachers provide students with tools and strategies to  complete assignments independently. Our teachers continue to develop learning extensions to provide high achieving  students with appropriate rigor and challenge. Our Quality Review addressed an issue with rigor, that our higher  achieving students were challenged. There will be an increase in the number of student taking and passing the  Advanced Placement Exams. We will develop more opportunities to choose more challenging assignments but giving  hope early success to struggling students.   Analysis of student work, test results, lesson plans and observations show that:   ● There is alignment to the Common Core in classroom instruction which includes Argumentative Writing,  Response to Literature, Informational and Non Fiction Writing and Creative Writing  ● Essential Questions are addressed, teachers need to work on developing more challenging questions.   ● We strive to develop higher order thinking skills utilizing the Depth of Knowledge Levels.  ● Our professional development efforts on text complexity, reflection on student outcomes and creating a  culture of learners has been effective, but needs to be continued and evolved.  ● Due to recent PPO, while have begun the process developing multiple entry points in student activities, staff  demonstrates a range of skill in incorporating multiple entry Points, scaffolding and student engagement.  ● Depth of Knowledge has become part of the “LESP language of instruction”  ● Expanding of Advanced Placement Examination offerings continues to inform our instructional agenda,  specifically with regard to vertical alignment and our investment in college and career readiness.   In our Designs for Learning Professional Learning community, teachers meet in departmental groups and work  together to convert and adapt their existing curriculum to meet the Common Core Learning Strategies. Lessons and  strategies that address the CCLS are taught and peer feedback is given when lessons are deconstructed. Teachers  have also created tasks based the NYC Baseline Performance Exams, in reflection of the particular MOSL exam. ENL  teachers have created learning tasks modeled on the tasks found on the New York State English as a Second Language  Achievement Test (NYSESLAT), while content area teachers have created similar NYS Regents-based learning tasks.  September Professional Development was followed by our November professional development workshop during  which we focused on creating common core aligned tasks as well as task that address academic vocabulary  instruction. A four session Designs for Learning cycle was dedicated to CCLS argument writing. All LESP teachers have  been provided resources to assist in planning questions and activities that may promote such skills (i.e. Depth of  Knowledge higher-order thinking “wheels”).  Our Regents data, Common Core Assessments and improved NYSESLAT scores are evidence of the increased rigor of  our classroom instruction.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14     Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).      D4L is a weekly, teacher-led professional development  experience (4 sessions per month/80 minutes each) in which  groups of LESP teachers work collaboratively to deepen their  understanding of the best instructional practices for working  with our students. In D4L teachers address a menu of focus  topics, designed to support our work with the Common Core  Learning Standards, Advance (teacher evaluation system) and  the NYC School Quality Snapshot. The focus topics this year  include:           Developing multiple entry points for student learning   activities.     Knowing Your Students/Data-Driven Decision   Making/Using Learner Work to Inform Instruction     Engaging Learners Through Critical Thinking Questions    Engaging Learners Through Critical Thinking Discussions    Establishing an Emotionally Supportive Classroom Culture      Assessing Learning Throughout the Learning Cycle   Supporting Learner Literacy Across the Content Areas   In their D4L groups, teachers engage in protocol-based  discussions of professional articles related to each focus topic.  Teacher groups also use protocols to analyze authentic teaching  artifacts and to examine student work. At the end of each cycle,  teachers submit a teaching artifact that demonstrates how they  have incorporated their understanding of the topic into their  instructional practice.      The discussions, artifacts and student work that result from each  D4L cycle directly inform the work of our PD Committee.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16         Our Parent Coordinator will ensure our School Leadership Team  Meetings and Parent Meetings will include agenda items which  address rigorous instruction and instructional strategies that may  be employed to assist our students with disabilities and English  Language Learners to succeed Academically and Socially. this  process may feature subject area teachers addressing  instructional issues with parents and the School Leadership  Team.          3b – Parent and Family Engagement   How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York  State standards in order to support their children at home?

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  As our population fluctuates, in terms of ethnicity, languages, and number of students served, we respond to their  needs in order to build a cohesive community in which everyone feels supported. We have a well-developed credit  bearing after school program, a robotics program, multiple team sports (basketball, table tennis, track, volleyball),  Muslim club and Spanish Speakers club were developed as a result of student interest and other clubs including chess,  knitting, the Chinese Culture Club and the English Language club. Additionally, student activities, such as the New  Student Welcome, the Coordinator of Student Activities programs, the annual Thanksgiving dinner (which fed more  than 300 students), talent show, and our annual student community building trip to Camp Mason, all strengthen the  level of student trust and buy-in to our program. Through extensive professional development, teachers’  understanding about their roles in identifying at-risk students and addressing the needs of all students, creates a  cultural and philosophical shift that benefits student academically and socially.   Our teachers indicated (through a professional development survey) a desire for more professional learning around  emotionally supportive classrooms. To this end we hired a school social worker to develop student centered programs  addressing individual student and family issues on an ongoing basis. Our social worker will also provide teachers with  professional workshops identifying strategies which teachers could implement in support of the emotional needs of  their students and parents. We are also providing a “counselling in schools” counselor and developing a program with  Lincoln Center to reflect on teacher persona development.  As a result, our hope is that teachers will continue to expand their guidance in helping students develop their  resiliency skills, to continually nurture the “whole student.” By sharing information via platforms like Skedula,  participating in teacher team discussions, and working across content areas, teachers can better identify trends,  access resources, and enact plans to help students succeed. By tying high expectations to our over-age under-credited  students, the school helps students see their potential and set goals greater than they would have expected for  themselves. College and career readiness will be at the forefront for our students.

Through our Designs for Learning Professional Learning Community, all LESP teachers work toward promoting the  implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards and the instructional shifts. The Professional Development  Committee, play important roles in both the gathering and then disseminating of information regarding student  achievement and professional development needs. The information that they provide informs the planning,  implementation and delivery of the professional development that, in turn, informs our pedagogy. D4L is a weekly,  teacher-led professional development experience (4 sessions per month/80 minutes each) in which groups of LESP  teachers work collaboratively to deepen their understanding of the best instructional practices for working with our  students. In D4L teachers address a menu of focus topics, designed to support our work with the Common Core  Learning Standards, Advance (teacher evaluation system) and the NYC . The focus topics this year include:     Knowing Your Students/Data-Driven Decision Making/Using Learner Work to Inform Instruction    Engaging Learners Through Critical Thinking Questions    Engaging Learners Through Critical Thinking Discussions    Establishing an Emotionally Supportive Classroom Culture      Assessing Learning Throughout the Learning Cycle   Supporting Learner Literacy Across the Content Areas   In their D4L groups, teachers engage in protocol-based discussions of professional articles related to each focus topic.  Teacher groups also use protocols to analyze authentic teaching artifacts and to examine student work. At the end of  each cycle, teachers submit a teaching artifact that demonstrates how they have incorporated their understanding of  the topic into their instructional practice.   The PD committee surveys the staff via needs assessment. From the data collected, the PD Committee, working in  collaboration with colleagues, staff developers and administrators, creates a menu of professional learning that  ensures that the expressed needs of the program, the staff and the students are met.   The success of our Professional Learning Community and collaborative Teaching was identified as well developed by  our most recent Quality Review.

On our most recent Quality Review (2014-2015), the administration and school earned well developed in the areas of  Teacher teams and leadership development, Curriculum, Assessment and High Expectations. A Proficient was earned  in Pedagogy. As a result of these outcomes we have invested time and resources toward preparing teachers to  provide high achieving students with appropriate rigor and challenge. We have also focused on having teachers  provide tools and strategies for students to independently complete tasks, projects and activities.   Administration communicated the new mission and vision for the school. Staff also developed mission and vision for  each content area reflecting the school's mission and vision statements.   We continue to receive the support of a leadership consultant who participates weekly as a member of our cabinet,  providing feedback and reflection on providing feedback, identifying partnerships, securing funding, and the sharing  of responsibility with the teachers and community as a whole. Our main goals are to develop and maintain trust  between all stakeholders so that teachers are effective and student outcomes improve.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.    The real strength of the school is the creation of a school that allows teachers to share and experiment with various  instructional techniques. For example, our Designs for Learning program incorporates actual lessons with students to  be demonstrated, followed by warm and cool feedback. Elements of this protocol have been developed in concert  with the pedagogical staff and the administration. This model continues to foster conversations and improvement in  lesson delivery. There is a teacher committee constantly improving and evolving the process to refine feedback and  derive maximum benefit for all teachers and students.   We offer our teachers opportunities to attend Professional Development Conferences including TESOL, Association  for Supervision and Curriculum Development, National Council of teachers of English, the National Principal’s Institute  the Harvard School of Education.  The administration has a firm commitment to on-site, individualized Professional Development. To that end, we  devote a major portion of discretionary funds to providing teachers with the best consultants available. There is a full  time coach on staff to further initiatives and mentors one teacher at a time. Additionally, there is on-going support  provided by the Teacher Center staff developer, Generation Ready, the New York City Writing Project, QTEL and the  office of ELL’s. Staff developers are on site for the equivalent of three days per week in addition to our full time, on- staff teacher center/ literacy coach.  Lower East Side Preparatory High School has a partnership with New York University. Through this partnership we  have offered several student teaching placements. When we have an opening we are able to draw from the student  teachers we have trained to be teachers in our schools. In addition we have hosted student teachers from Hunter  College.  One of the earmarks of the school is that we currently have three teachers and an educational paraprofessional who  are graduates of LESP. We have also hired six teachers who were student teachers trained by our staff.  We have a rigorous interview process where candidates present before a group of administrators and teachers.  Qualified candidates then have to present a demonstration lesson which is assessed for content, student  engagement, classroom management and knowledge of content.       2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Structure         Description   Participants   D4L is a weekly, teacher-led professional  development experience (4 sessions per month/80  minutes each) in which groups of LESP teachers work  collaboratively to deepen their understanding of the  best instructional practices for working with our  students. In D4L teachers address a menu of focus  topics, designed to support our work with the  Common Core Learning Standards, Advance (teacher  evaluation system) and the NYC School Quality  Snapshot. The focus topics this year include:     Knowing Your Students/Data-Driven Decision   Making/Using Learner Work to Inform  Instruction     Engaging Learners Through Critical Thinking   Questions     Engaging Learners Through Critical Thinking   Discussions         Designs for Learning   (D4L)     Establishing an Emotionally Supportive      Classroom Culture  Supporting Learner Literacy Across the  Content Areas     Assessing Learning Throughout the Learning   Cycle      Administrators, Teacher  Facilitators, All teaching  staff, UFT Teacher  Center Instructional  Coach, Generation  Ready Consultant    In their D4L groups, teachers engage in protocol- based discussions of professional articles related to  each focus topic. Teacher groups also use protocols  to analyze authentic teaching artifacts and to  examine student work. At the end of each cycle,  teachers submit a teaching artifact that demonstrates  how they have incorporated their understanding of  the topic into their instructional practice.      The discussions, artifacts and student work that result  from each D4L cycle directly inform the work of our  PD Committee   (see Designs for Learning Facilitators / PD Committee  see below)           At LESP, teacher-facilitators for our D4L professional  development group also serve as the school’s PD   Administrators, Teacher  facilitators, UFT Teacher   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Designs for Learning   Facilitators / PD  Committee /                   PD Days      9/4/2018   11/6/2018   01/28/2018   6/6/2018   Book Study Groups   Protocol Training   Committee. As stated above teacher D4L facilitators  collect data from their colleagues’ discussions, from  teacher artifacts and from student work to plan  future professional development. By creating an  organizational structure that integrates the planning  and delivery of professional development, we have  found that our professional development is more  responsive to the expressed pedagogical needs of our  teaching staff, and at the same time is more  supportive of student achievement.     Our PD Committee periodically creates and  administers surveys to assess the perceived  professional needs of their colleagues. Results of  these surveys are shared with the faculty, and the  information obtained is used to plan professional  development on city-wide Staff Development Days.      We will continue this practice.         Our book study groups (one for teachers; one for  guidance counselors) are an opportunity for  educators to engage in professional discussions  around a specific topic related to teaching and  learning. Participants who commit to read and  discuss a selected book are guided by the question  “How will this book influence professional practice  both at the classroom and school-wide level?”     D4L teacher facilitators have received six (6) hours of  training from NYU (Steinhardt School of Culture,  Education and Human Development) in the use of  protocols.      Teacher facilitators and participants have responded  positively to the use of protocols to structure our  professional discussions in a variety of settings,  including D4L.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42     conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.

The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Lower East Side Preparatory High School, in compliance with the Section 1118  of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.

The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.

Title III funds do not pay for Saturday programming.  In each class, students will work with texts selected based on their lexile levels. Through guided  interaction with carefully selected texts, students will examine the various techniques that writers  use to convey ideas within content-specific documents and informational texts. The learning  activities in these courses will include, but not be limited to, group discussion and rigorous  reading and writing assignments. Students in these courses will also address those academic and  personal behaviors required for long-term self- management and success with academically  demanding tasks.

The goal of professional learning at LESP is to provide both teachers and administrators with a  variety of opportunities and contexts in which to practice, reflect on, and refine ideas about the  pedagogical beliefs and practices that result in increased academic achievement for the students  at our school. Given the unique demographic of our student population (i.e. over-aged, under- credited ENL, new-comers) our professional learning necessarily seeks to address the academic  literacy skills including SIOP, Common core for ELLs, Scaffolding, Differentiation, Tiered  Vocabulary, and Resiliency that are considered best teaching practices for ELLs. In addition, our  professional learning is designed to support those academic and personal behaviors that are often  reserved for students identified as having had interrupted education.               The collaborative professional learning community that is involved in offering the proposed Title  III Program classes will meet as needed to review practices, discuss student work and plan  during their weekly professional Work Time.  In addition, the professional learning community  members participate in a variety of school-wide professional learning activities that support and  extend our entire staff’s work with SIFE/ENL students.      In general, professional learning at LESP takes place in the following ways:  Designs for Learning- facilitated by Richard Ciriello, our Instructional Coach and ENL lead  teacher, DFL is a weekly, teacher-led professional learning experience (4 sessions per month/80  minutes each) in which all LESP teachers work in collaborative groups to deepen their  understanding of the best instructional practices for working with our students. In DFL, teachers  address a menu of focus topics, designed to support our work with ELLs and SIFE, particularly  as it relates to the Common Core Learning Standards, Advance (teacher evaluation system) and  the Framework for Great Schools. The focus topics this year include:   •  Knowing Your ENL Students/Data-Driven Decision Making (9/12, 9/26, 10/3, 10/10, 10/17,  10/24)  •  Academic Rigor for ENL Students (10/31, 11/7, 11/14, 11/28, 12/5, 12/12, 12/19)   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         Part C: Professional Development   •  Engaging ENLs (1/9, 1/16, 1/30, 2/6, 2/13, 2/27, 3/6, 3/13)   •  Academic Questioning and Student Discussion for ENLs (3/20, 3/27, 4/3, 4/10, 4/17, 5/1, 5/8)  •  Differentiation for High-Achieving ENL Students (5/15, 5/22, 5/29)  DFL groups are led by trained teacher-facilitators. In DFL groups, teachers engage in protocol- based discussions of professional articles related to each focus topic. Teacher groups also use  protocols to analyze authentic teaching artifacts and to examine student work. At the end of each  cycle, teachers produce a teaching artifact that demonstrates how they have incorporated their  understanding of the topic into their instructional practice.     The discussions, artifacts, and student work that result from each DFL cycle directly inform the  work of our PD Committee which includes administrators, Title III activity teachers and  our Instructional Coach.  Professional Learning Committee / Designs for Learning Facilitators- At LESP, teacher- facilitators for our DFL professional learning group also serve as the school’s PD Committee. As  stated above teacher DFL facilitators collect data from their colleagues’ discussions, from  teacher artifacts and from student work. The PD Committee also periodically creates and  administers staff surveys to plan future professional development. Results of these surveys are  shared with the faculty and administration, and the information is used to plan professional  learning activities on Staff Development Days. Teachers have requested professional  development that addresses the topics of scaffolding and questioning / discussion strategies for  beginner ENLs and pre-literate students.  We have found that by creating an organizational structure that integrates the planning and  delivery of professional learning, our professional learning is more responsive to the expressed  pedagogical needs of our teaching staff, and at the same time is more supportive of student  achievement, especially for struggling students.   Generation Ready Staff Developer- Our professional learning team includes a Generation Ready  consultant who assists us to support the implementation of the Framework for Great Schools  across each department and throughout the school. This consultant also supports the training of  the eight lead teachers, some of whom are grant teachers,  to meet their individual needs as  professional development providers in training. Finally our Gen Ready consultant implements a  classroom inter-visitation Lab Site learning experience with teachers identified by our  administrators. Much of the work of our Gen Ready consultant is focused on assisting teachers in  raising the academic achievement of our ELL/SIFE population.   Education Consultants – Based on feedback data generated from PD Committee surveys, our  administrators have also contracted with outside educational consultants.   Through Harvard University of Education, we are currently working with Elizabeth City and Lee  Tietel and their “Instructional Rounds” program. This program will allow teachers and  administrators to employ an effective, classroom-oriented approach to observing, analyzing, and  improving teaching and learning. By making low-stakes observations with their peers  and holding discussions in a non-judgemental way, teachers can address the needs  around various topics like academic vocabulary acquisition or decoding syntax for ELL students.  We have also established a working relationship with Eskolta and their “How can feedback help  turn students around?” program. The goal of this relationship is to improve student achievement,  especially for our SIFE population, by embedding resiliency instruction, clear steps  for improvement and achievement into our teaching.              None of these professional development programs are paid for with Title III funds.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

Parents will participate in ten 1 hour (one per  month) parental workshops offered by the as part of our partnership with New York  University.  Our New York University College Advising Corp Member offers college, financial  aid, and college application workshops once a month.  Additional programs will be devoted to a  variety of issues including acculturation (offered by School Guidance Counselor), finances  including opening a bank account (Offered by Banco Popular), financial aid and scholarships  (NYU college Advising Corp Member), immigration support (Asian Americans for Equality),  and housing (Julian Castro, Housing and Urban Development Secretary).  We will implement  strong student supports to increase graduation rates by having guidance meet with new-comer”  ELL students, SIFE students and long-term ELL students to provide ongoing, college and career  readiness. None of these programs are at a cost for Title III.  In terms of Parental Support, we offer 20-25 parents a weekly, 2-3 hour course, for 14 weeks  each semester in technology and ESL. Our Parent Coordinator provides parents are given the  opportunity to learn how to utilize various computer programs including, but not limited to word  processing, email, excel, conducting internet searches and checking the progress of their child on  PupilPath.  We are giving parents very useful tools for surviving in New York City.  These are  offered at no cost to Title III funding.  In conjunction with this program we provide cultural opportunities for participating parents who  may otherwise not have access. We provide workshops in both English, Spanish and Chinese and  prepare parents to see cultural performances including Broadway plays, sporting events and  cultural displays (We have set aside $5358 of Title III funds for this program).  Our parent  Coordinator will conduct a total of three workshops prior to attending these performances in the  parents’ native languages to prepare them with information and descriptions about what they will  see and experience.  We will have discussions and connect to the parents’ experience as a new  immigrant.  By helping to acculturate parents to their new city and community, we enhance the  opportunities of ELL parents and broaden the scope of their understanding of our culture.    Parents are notified via bimonthly parental newsletter, phone master, via and PupilPath.  All  attendance records and agendas are maintained by our Parent Coordinator.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  At LESP, we use the following formative and curriculum-embedded assessments to help guide our instructional planning for  our ELLs:    - NYSITELL  - in-house native language test (Spanish and Chinese)  - in-house math examination  - SIFE questionnaire (if qualified)  - Spanish LAB-R (if qualified)  - teacher-created diagnostic assessments  - NYSESLAT   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         - department-wide formative and summative assessments  - teacher-created performance tasks     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   After evaluating the above assessments, we place the student into an ENL course that matches their level and required  number of minutes. Due to a large variety of ENL and content courses offered at LESP, teachers constantly re-assess the  students using diagnostic tools as well as teacher-created tests. Together, in our professional development teams, ENL  teachers work together to identify and address patterns of weaknesses in literacy and student progress. We examine and track  student achievement through a data inquiry process, oftentimes adjusting the curriculum based on our findings. Students are  given two formative and one summative assessment that mirror the NYSESLAT exam, testing them on the four areas of  reading, writing, listening, and speaking. These scores are tracked for each student by their teachers, and teachers then target  instruction to close learning gaps, addressing either the reading, writing, listening, or speaking portions of the formative  assessment. As our students advance through the different ENL levels (from 1-8), teachers start preparing students for the  English Regents, the SAT, as well as college-level reading and writing.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our programs for English Language Learners in a variety of ways. Currently, we amass information  from teachers and students, and make changes based on the following pieces of data: class essays, course exams, midterms  and finals, the NYSESLAT score growth, and the English Regents passing rate for our ELLs.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The Literacy Coach works with the ENL Department to address and re-evaluate our Common Core benchmarks for ENL  students based on the baseline and benchmark assessments. Specifically, ENL teachers map out the curriculum, aligning the  various skills to each level, ensuring students are meeting each level. The Assistant Principal works with the ELL Coordinator to  address programming opportunities to close skill gaps by creating additional courses or targeted tutoring sessions.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   We do not use RtI since we serve grades 10-12 at LESP.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   At LESP, we as a school examine the academic growth of students closely. Through an inquiry process looking at NYSESLAT  scores, ELA Regents scores, SAT scores, student, alumni, and parent responses to surveys, we know that our students are  progressing in a linear fashion. We also use the ELL Data Analysis Tool to track those who have not made enough progress, and  continually create programs to address this gap.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Teachers meet in department and staff meetings to dissect, understand, and share these findings with each other.  Adjustments to the curriculum are made throughout the year in response to student progress. Our community is kept abreast  of the work being done through mailings home. The principal keeps an open door policy so that suggestions are welcomed and  offered at the SLT/PA meetings.         Part IV: ELL Programming     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   At LESP the instructional period is 47 minutes. The bell schedule allows for classes to meet 5 times in a week, allowing  a double period once a week. LESP uses a balanced literacy model and each classroom has its own library. Teachers  use the SIOP model and lesson plan format. Teachers use guided or shared reading in their instruction. A full time  literacy coach provides professional development for teachers. Instruction is delivered in bilingual content areas using  the SIOP model in conjunction with the workshop model, or other method that allows for student engagement.  Students' English language levels vary in all content classes, therefore, teachers must differentiate the instruction. ENL  teachers work with content area teachers to design and deliver curriculum that supports content area classes.  Currently, we are incorporating New York State's Common Core Learning Standards into daily instruction in all classes  with the focus on text complexity. In our stand-alone ESL model, students are given one or two periods of ENL,  depending on their tested level with a licensed ENL teacher. Students who study in our integrated model have ENL  teachers push into their content-area courses. In NLA classes, the curriculum is designed to support the ELA  standards, in order for students to be successful on the New York States English Regents. Through native language  literature, students learn the literary elements and how to answer the tasks on the English Regents Exam, such as the  critical lens question, in their own language. LESP offers the departmentalized organization model, with ENL being the  largest department. ENL/English and NLA teachers work closely with one another to ensure student progress and  proficiency on the NYSESLAT exam and English Regents exam. Students receive three periods of ENL and one period of  NLA instruction.  Both ENL and NLA classes are based on language level, not grade. Our other departments, Math,  Science and Social Studies have both bilingual and monolingual teachers who meet regularly as a department. Again,  classes are not organized by grade levels, rather on individual student needs. Students in ENL 1-4 are given bilingual  classes in the content area, and classes are heterogeneous or mixed English ability. Teachers are expected to  differentiate instructional materials. When students reach ENL 5 we transition them into monolingual classes to  ensure proficiency on the New York State Regents Exam, since many exams are not offered in their own language.  Since we are a transfer school, every student is given an individualized program.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Instruction is delivered in bilingual content areas using the SIOP model in conjunction with the workshop model, or  other method that allows for student engagement. Student levels vary in all classes, therefore, teachers must  differentiate the instruction. ESL teachers work with content area teachers to design and deliver curriculum that  supports content area classes. Currently, we are incorporating New York State's Common Core Learning Standards  into daily instruction in all classes with the focus on text complexity. In NLA classes, the curriculum is designed to  support the ELA standards, in order for students to be successful on the New York States English Regents. Through  native literature, students learn the literary elements and how to answer the tasks on the English Regents Exam, such  as the critical lens question.  Both ESL and NLA classes are based on level not grade. Our other departments, Math,  Science and Social Studies have both bilingual and monolingual teachers who meet regularly as a department. Again  classes are not organized by grade only on students individualized needs. Students in ESL 1-4 are given bilingual  classes in the content area, and classes are heterogeneous or mixed English ability. Teachers are expected to  differentiate the material. When students reach ESL 5 we transition them into monolingual classes to ensure  proficiency on the New York State Regents Exam, since many exams are not offered in Chinese. Since we are a  transfer school, every student is given an individualized program.    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      We do not have one at this time.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Students in the integrated ENL model who tested at the Entering (Beginner) level receive 2 periods (90 minutes) daily of ENL  instruction, and 1 period of integrated ENL/ELA per week, totalling 675 minutes per week. Students in Emerging/Transitioning  (Intermediate) level receive 1 period daily of ENL instruction, and 1 period of integrated ENL/ELA per week, totalling 450  minutes per week. Expanding (Advanced) students receive 1 period daily of ENL instruction, and 1 period of integrated  ENL/ELA per week, totalling 450 minutes per week. We offer more than the mandated minutes according to each proficiency  level due to our previous history of success in preparing students for the English Regents and to help them become college and  career ready. In our stand-alone model, students in the Entering level receive 2 periods daily of ENL instruction, and Emerging  level students receive 2 periods daily of ENL instruction. Simultaneously, students who opt for the Transitional Bilingual  Education program (TBE) receive at least 180 minutes of Home Language Arts instruction per week. Classes/periods are 45  minutes and meet five times a week.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   There are currently 11 fully certified ENL teachers, 10 fully certified bilingual and one ENL/bilingual teacher at the school. We  currently offer 33 ENL/Integrated ENL-ELA Classes ranging from ENL 1 (Emerging) to ENL 7/8 (Expanding). At registration,  students are placed in ENL classes based on the student's NYSITELL score. Our bilingual program provides instruction in  Chinese or Spanish. For example, when we offer Bilingual Living Environment Term One, students can expect the teacher to be  licensed in the correct content area and be able to deliver the instruction in Chinese as well as English. As the term progresses,  mostly instruction is done in English by the end of the term. In a regular, monolingual Living Environment Term One course,  the instruction is entirely in English, offering glossaries to help the students while an ENL teacher may push into the class.  Currently, we offer the following courses as bilingual: Living Environment term one and two, Earth Science term one and two.  Forensics, Living Environment, Earth Science, and Chemistry are taught in English, open to all students, as well as ENL students  who are at an ENL level 5 and above or for those who opt for a standalone ENL program. The Social Studies Department offers  Global and US History as bilingual classes. Economics and Participation in Government are only taught in English, however  students taking these classes are also expected to be at an ENL Level 5 or higher before being considered for programming.  The Math Department offers Algebra and Geometry in the bilingual program. Currently, LESP has a teacher working towards  getting his license in bilingual Spanish US and Global history. Trigonometry and AP Calculus instruction is delivered in English  only, with glossaries to assist instruction. All teachers across the content area provide translated materials, work on vocabulary  development, and use modified materials for ELL students. Many of the ENL teachers also offer supplementary lessons to  support all content area classes. All materials correspond to the level of each student as determined through formative and  summative assessments developed by teachers, as well as performance on periodic assessments, and the NYSESLAT. The  whole LESP staff as engaged in on-going weekly professional learning, called Designs for Learning. There, collaborative content  area groups gather with at least one ENL teacher to facilitate a modified Japanese Lesson Study. Teachers infuse their lessons  with a focus on the CCSS, their personal Danielson goals, as well as the topic of discussion. Each lesson is collaboratively  designed, observed with a critical eye, and is then given feedback through the use of protocols. Each teacher then transforms  their lesson plans to incorporate what they have learned. The department teams also collaborates to create performance- based CCSS-aligned tasks, and uses them as periodic assessments. During department meetings, teachers gather to discuss  their students' performance, and continually adjust their unit and lesson plans to meet the needs of their students. By  supporting each content area with a teacher from the ENL department, content teachers are reminded of the different  language learning strategies that can be used.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   NLA and bilingual teachers assess students regularly using teacher-created formative and summative assessments throughout  the semester. Mirroring the LOTE and Regents exams, teachers examine students' scores and progress in their own language.  As they progress in their own home language, higher-level courses are offered to the students, including AP Spanish and AP  Chinese to those who make progress.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    All teachers are strategic when planning their lessons and are expected to use the SIOP model. Since our student body is very  diverse, and includes a large population of ELLs, as well as transfer students from around the city, we focus on scaffolding the  material for all learners and differentiating the instruction. Teachers use a variety of pre-assessment tools when beginning a  unit of study to differentiate and group students. Lessons are built around student readiness, motivation and interest.        a.   SIFE      b.   Newcomer      c.   Developing      d.   Long Term        e.   Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status              6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELL-SWDs plan lessons with their students in mind, and have created a variety of differentiated materials. The  dually licensed ELL/SPED teacher conducts frequent professional development sessions with teachers to share these materials.  Strategies like using translated graphic organizers, creating picture glossaries, and using technology (iPads, Smartboard,  individual laptops, Duolingo, etc.) allow ELL-SWDs to access the material.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  All ELL-SWD students have been programmed for a SETSS class, and are mainstreamed in their coursework. To ensure students  receive rigorous coursework, while accommodating for the learning disabilities, teachers use principles of Universal Designs for  Learning to provide access at various entry points in their lessons. By varying modalities, tasks, and groups, students who are  ELL-SWD are encouraged to achieve their IEP goals and attain proficiency. Additionally, students are scheduled for an  additional resource room period with a dually licensed ELL/SPED teacher, who conducts small group and one-on-one tutoring  for each content area. To ensure students are still gaining an adequate number of credits each semester, students also take  after-school courses.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      At LESP we offer a range of programs for students that are struggling and need additional support. The Guidance Department  identifies students that need to take the ELA and Math Regents exams. Students who are not performing at grade level are  given an additional Math support lab course. Students can also attend tutoring during lunch, in which students are paired up  with someone who speaks the same language as them. We have also cultivated and trained peer tutors of all subjects, so  students who need help are given the opportunity. Students who are not meeting grade level standards in English are given  additional help by our push-in ENL teachers. Each ELA class is targeted to the different ENL levels. To target interventions for  science classes, individual teachers provide tutoring time before the day starts, during lunch, and after school. The science lab  specialist is also a resource who sits with students to complete any labs or assignments in class. Social studies teachers do the  same, though there is also an additional Global Support class that gives students targeted ENL and Global history instruction.  All science teachers speak English, as well as Chinese or Spanish. Of our Social Studies teachers, two speak Chinese, and two  speak Spanish. While all non-bilingual courses have an ENL focus, teachers working collaboratively to translate course  materials and being able to speak their students' home language allows for students to attain content knowledge better.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the upcoming school year, the ENL Department will continue to refine their work to make the CCLS accessible to the ELLs.  Additionally, we have accepted students who are long-term ELLs, and have created a course targeting these students to allow  them to pass the NYSESLAT and English Regents after school. We are also looking to offer after-school classes that are  specifically geared towards ELLs, including Government and Economics, to meet the linguistic and background knowledge  challenges students face. We have also hired an dual-licensed ESL/SPED teacher to address lon-gterm and SIFE ELLs.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We have never closed a bilingual program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our school is set up for equal access. Since most of our students are ELLs, teachers encourage students to attend after school  tutoring, volunteering, and after-school classes. Also, they are given information through the Parent Association and SLT  meetings, as well as from their guidance counselors and teachers. All students' programs are individualized to ensure students  are able to access the curricula appropriate to their levels. We try to ensure that all information disseminated is translated into  their home languages.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Teacher-created bilingual and scaffolded English language materials, bilingual textbooks, glossaries and dictionaries in all the  languages our students speak. All teachers have signage in their rooms, including sentence starters and word walls in their  native language and English that allow students to actively participate in our classrooms. The vast majority of our students are  ELLs, so each classroom equipped with Smartboards, laptop carts, iPads, electronic books, are all available to the students. We  boast an ELL focused library containing leveled ESL books, graphic novels, and literature in both English, Spanish, Chinese, and  other various languages.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Most of our staff is bilingual. Students take NLA classes in Chinese and Spanish, and are offered the opportunity to take AP  language classes. Our Parent Coordinator works with families to raise awareness about the ways in which use of home  language can support bilingual literacy. For students who opt into the ENL program, we provide content and support materials  in the students' native language. All ENL students have glossaries and dictionaries in their home language. Students are also  offered technology to help access information in their home languages. We know our programs support the HL due to our  students' overall ability to take and pass the AP language exam.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Most, if not all, students attending LESP are over-age and under-credited, and thus being a transfer school, we are ungraded.  Students are placed into classes by proficiency level. The ELL Coordinator tells the Guidance Counselors what proficiency level  the students were tested at, and which classes they need to be in. The Guidance Counselors then programs the student for the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         classes. After the student is enrolled, the ELL Coordinator checks each students' program again to ensure the services and  resources correspond to their ELL proficiency levels and allotted minutes. If there are any discrepancies, they are brought to  the attention of the Guidance Counselor, who would immediately correct it to their best ability.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Since we share a building, we meet at a building council meeting to discuss potential programs for ELLs and sharing of  resources. All resources are open to the other two school's for viewing. Teacher-created bilingual and scaffolded English  language materials, bilingual textbooks, glossaries and dictionaries in all the languages our students speak. All teachers have  signage in their rooms, including sentence starters and word walls in their native language and English that allow students to  actively participate in our classrooms. The vast majority of our students are ELLs, so each classroom equipped with  Smartboards, laptop carts, iPads, electronic books, are all available to the students. We boast an ELL focused library containing  leveled ESL books, graphic novels, and literature in both English, Spanish, Chinese, and other various languages. We have  access to the gym for two periods a day, the lunchroom for one period a day, and the auditorium and dance studio are shared  via a Google calendar.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   In the beginning of the school year, all students attend an assembly to get introduced to various personnel who would help  them throughout their time at LESP. Each October we have a new student picnic in which all new students are invited to  attend for free, connecting them to the various clubs and activities at school. Our Coordinator of Student Activities holds  monthly events for all students. There are various clubs and teams for students to join, and the Guidance Counselors, Parent  Coordinator, and teachers all help to advertise for them. All flyers and advertisements are written and spoken in three  languages to allow all students access. Peer mentors are assigned to allow students to feel included and kept aware of what  happens at LESP.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Students are able to take NLA, AP Chinese, and AP Spanish.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We do not have a dual language program at this time.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  LESP aligns its yearly professional development plan to the Citywide Instructional Expectations, Danielson's Framework for  Teaching, New York State Professional Learning Standards, and more recently, Byrk's Framework for Great Schools. All  teachers receive professional development on employing the SIOP method for lesson planning. All administrators, bilingual  content area teachers, NLA teachers, and ELL teachers participate in a uniquely designed professional learning experience  weekly at LESP known as Designs for Learning. Designs for Learning is set up in a module format, where teachers engage  deeply in a topic for an extended amount of time. This school year, 2015-2016, the focus will be on Questioning, Student   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         Discussion, and CCLS Student Writing. Every module within D4L will focus on CCLS and Danielson's Teacher Framework. During  the sessions, teachers use a variety of data; including Regents, NYSESLAT, in-house assessments, and student work to  determine curricular items in need of improvement. By examining student work through protocol-based discussions, teachers  transform their lessons to address the module's focus. Teachers work together in departments to show how students have  acquired the particular skill or content that was identified as in need of improvement. All teachers show how they've  workshopped their units. Richard Ciriello, the Literacy Coach, continues to work with teachers on an individual basis to create  lessons that better align to the SIOP method of planning. The Generation Ready professional developer visits our school once a  week to provide one-to-one professional development to targeted teachers for a six-week cycle. At the end of the six-week  cycle, the teacher's classroom becomes a lab-site for other teachers to visit and observe the work that was accomplished and  provide feedback. We continue to partner with Lincoln Center (Learning English and Drama program), which provides  professional development to three teachers on staff.      As our students are mostly new immigrants, transitioning from high school in China or Dominican Republic to the US, the  guidance counselors meet with each student and parent prior to giving them their programs to talk about what they should  expect and how to approach certain situations. There are also students who transfer from other NYC high schools, and  transition counseling occurs. The students are also enrolled in the after-school Walking and Talking NYC course, which  addresses the new culture they are in. The staff is reminded at the beginning of the year of the special needs our students  have as ELLs, newcomers, transfer students, etc. The guidance team also attends PD through various entities like the DELLSS,  College Board, Child Mind Institute, Living Undocumented, and other organizations to broaden their skillset to support ELLs.  These workshop materials are then turn-keyed to each other, and to the teachers so that all staff are updated. Because more  than 70% of our population are immigrants from China or Spanish speaking countries, every Professional Development  opportunity is geared toward ELL training for content teachers. Designs for Learning occurs weekly and uses the SIOP model of  lesson planning. Our literacy coach continues to hold lunch time meetings for content area teachers interested in extending  their understanding of different approaches to ELL instruction. Our mandated Professional Development days are focused on  refining our understanding of the CCLS in conjunction with Universal Design for Learning strategies that focus on ELLs. All  minutes, agendas, and sign-in sheets are kept and filed in the Principal's office and Teacher Center to ensure teachers receive  the required amount of PD.  In addition to the in-house Designs for Learning sessions, teachers are given opportunities to attend PD given throughout the  city and country. Our teachers are encouraged to attend PD offered by DELLSS, Teachers College, and other organizations  around the city. A rotation of teachers are sent to TESOL conferences each year, and valuable information is then turnkeyed.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All teachers are given PD with an ENL focus due to the nature of our school. When engaging in our professional learning  sessions, our ENL students are kept at the forefront of discussions. When teachers bring in student work to examine, over 80%  of the students are ELLs or former ELLs, who need to be college and career ready. All professional learning activities are  planned with ELLs in mind, and the agendas are created by the Instructional Coach, along with the Assistant Principal.  Additionally, teacher leaders keep a binder of the work and activities done during professional learning, also taking attendance  through sign-in sheets and online tracking.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   During the registration process, our staff speaks to parents about their involvement being vital to their child's success at  school. Our Parent Coordinator and Guidance staff encourage parents to play an integral role in their child's education.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65            Teachers call and meet with parents/guardians on a regular basis to keep them abreast to how the students are progressing.  Individual conferences are set up with the parents throughout the year by the ENL teachers to discuss their formative  assessment results, goals, and continued progress. Most teachers and staff members at LESP speak another language and  often help to translate and interpret  (Chinese, Spanish, Polish, Russian, Japanese, Arabic, Haitian-Creole, Portuguese, French,  Korean, and Greek) during these annual individual parent meetings. If and when the language or person is unavailable,  LESP uses the Translation and Interpretation Unit's over-the-phone-interpretation service to help facilitate the meeting.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   During registration, all parents are given assistance in accessing PupilPath, a grade book communication platform. Our  family Para assists parents in finding free or reduced medical services. The Parent Coordinator also discusses LESP's Parent  Association's purpose and meeting times. All parents are encouraged to attend School Leadership Team meetings as well as  the Title I Parent Advisory Committee. Parents are offered classes to learn English and to participate in acculturation activities  around the city such as Broadway plays and visits to museums. Parents are invited to attend an ENL progress meeting in  addition to the Parent Teacher Conferences in the fall and spring, as well as Curriculum Night. Teachers call and meet with  parents/guardians on a regular basis to keep them abreast to how the students are progressing.

Through early  identification of students, collaborative planning and preparation, guidance support services, content area courses taught in  English and Chinese/Spanish infused with ENL methodologies and parent involvement, our school is working diligently on assisting  all students as they progress toward completion of their high school diploma requirements. Each component of our school,  (parents, students, faculty, and the School Leadership Team) is involved in the development, implementation of and assessment of  Lower East Side Prep’s ENL program. We are committed to providing quality instruction to all our students.                            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Rene Anaya, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Lower East Side Preparatory HS                                                                              School DBN: 01M515  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      To register for our school, students are required to bring a transcript and their parent/guardian. They fill out the  Home Identification Language Survey, emergency contact cards, take placement tests, and are then interviewed  by school aides, guidance counselors, our LAB BESIS teacher, as well as the Parent Coordinator. This process gives  us an indication of what their home language is, and the best way to communicate with them. Due to the unique  transitional bilingual Chinese program, much of the staff is fluent in Chinese. For students who speak Spanish, we  also have bilingual Spanish teachers, school aides, and educational paras to aid in translations.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      Language    We are currently serving the following  families:   Written  Preferred       Percent  Written       Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Albanian - 1   Amoy - 4   Arabic - 2   Bengali - 9   Bosnian - 1   Chechen - 2   Chinese - 66   Cantonese - 136   Czech - 1    French - 6   Hatian Creole - 2   Japanese - 1   Mandarin - 118   Russian - 1   Spanish - 120   Tibetan - 1   Turkish - 1   Vietnamese - 1   Wolof - 1   The rest speak English            3.

List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      Document Name    Month/Frequency Distributed to   How do you plan to translate?      Due to our mostly immigrant student  population, teachers are constantly  translating materials for students and  families. We also host a Curriculum  Night in which all flyers are translated  as well. We use PupilPath to  communicate with parents, which  automatically translates any emails  sent through the platform. To get  parents signed up, we send home  translated directions. All attendance  letters, guidance requests are sent in  the students' home language.   Newsletter   Every Month                 Families    Include procedures to ensure timely  provision of translated documents      to parents.

Teachers have access to  other teachers who speak the language, Skedula/Pupilpath, interpretation phone line, and Google translate.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      When parents enroll their child into our school, the Parent Coordinator provides this information during the initial  meeting. This information is translated and/or an interpreter is present to explain this information to the parent.  Flyers/brochures/letters are translated via home language when shared through Skedula/Pupilpath.         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We will use the parent survey results as well as any written or verbal feedback gathered by our staff to evaluate the  quality and availability of services.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72
