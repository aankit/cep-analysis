This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of Public School 257 is to provide children with a secure, nurturing environment where they will grow to  their fullest potential. P.S. 257 will motivate all children to learn in order to become responsible and productive  members of society. We have high expectations for all of our students. Students are encouraged to become life long  learners in order to achieve essential knowledge and the skills necessary to enable them to become good citizens. In  order to realize this goal, parents and teachers will work together to create an atmosphere of collaborative learning.  With the combined efforts of staff, students, parents, and the community, our students will develop a desire to learn   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      and excel. The students will commit themselves to become informed, knowledgeable, responsible, and productive  citizens in both democratic society and the world.             2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Public School 257 known as the Magnet School of the Performing Arts is located in the neighborhood of Williamsburg,  Brooklyn, NY. Our school offers a complete curriculum that is focused on project-based learning and it supports the  current research emphasizing the importance of music enrichment and the performing arts as it relates to improved  student achievement. Throughout the years, our Advanced Ballet Team won 1st place at the All-American Talent  Competition and were awarded 3rd place at the National Championships.    According to the Framework for Great Schools (Effective School Leadership, Strong Family-Community Ties, Trust and  Student Achievement), our school employs a full-time music teacher whose curriculum is designed to focus on  teaching our students’ basic music theory, exposing our students to various musical genres, and developing a deep  sense of music appreciation as it relates to their everyday lives and the world. Our students’ successes are showcased  during an end-of-year student recital where parents, teachers, and peers celebrate their accomplishments. Our music  enrichment programs are organized to offer our students learning opportunities during and after the instructional  school day. The programs offered help our students learn how to play musical instruments such as the trumpets,  recorders, piano, and drums in collaboration with Music & the Brain and Creative Music Programs, Inc. Other music  enrichment programs such as the PS 257 Multicultural Dance Club. These clubs work collaboratively performing in  musicals and special events. These clubs perform their productions in our auditorium that has undergone a one  million dollar renovation several years ago.      In the past three years (2016 - 2018), The N.Y.C. School Survey reflects our parent/teacher responses as it relates to  the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools indicates that we are at or above citywide averages in practically  every element/indicator. The Framework's six elements are Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative Teachers, Supportive  Environment, Effective School Leadership, Strong Family-Community ties, and Trust. In our February 2015 Quality  Review, P.S. 257 received a Proficient rating in the following Q.R. indicators: Curriculum 1.1, Effective  Teaching/Learning 1.2, and Student Assessment 2.2   According to the Framework for Great Schools (Strong Family-Community Ties, Trust, Effective School Leadership, and  Supportive Environment) the Public School 257 community has established strong partnerships with various  community-based organizations, such as Woodhull Hospital North Brooklyn Asthma Alliance initiative, Eastern District  YMCA, and the Grand Street Settlement. Educational partnerships have been established with Boricua College, St.,  Fordham University, the Center for Integrated Teacher Education (C.I.T.E.) and to provide them with professional  development (CTLE Continuing Teacher and Leader Education credits) and Generation Ready, inc. Business  partnerships have also been established with the Business Improvement District of Graham Avenue and Modern M.D.  who sponsors many activities within our school such as the beautification of our 2nd floor roof garden and shed.    Public School 257 was awarded the 2018-2019 ARTS grant to provide our ELLs and SWDs with performing arts  opportunities to learn how to play a recorder and to receive theater/singing lessons during the school day. In  addition, the Walentas Family Neighborhood Grant fully funds our after school Marching Band instruction, 2016 -  2018 Capital Renovation Project Grants will help to provide central air conditioning to our school's gymnasium and  provide us with a new stadium seating for our auditorium, and other numerous, diverse grants from local politicians  and we have been adopted by the Zimmerman family through the Donors Choose organization in order to enhance  our students learning experiences and to improve the school community at-large. The past grant awards included a  renovated library equipped with a research technology lab, state-of-the-art computer lab, two STEM labs dedicated to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      hands-on learning, tennis court, two student playgrounds, $1,000,000 electrical renovation including our recently  installed $175,000 brand new air conditioning system in our school’s auditorium, and an upcoming $250,000 air  conditioning system for the gymnasium which is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools.          3.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     School leadership team had a meeting to discuss adopting a new science program. Therefore, we agreed to use the  "AMPLIFY SCIENCE" curriculum. This new curriculum engages students in real world problems where they have to  investigate scientific phenomena, engage in collaboration and discussion, and develop models in order to develop a  solution. Amplify Science is a comprehensive program that blends literacy rich activities, it empowers students to  think read, write, and argue like real 21st century scientists and engineers. Our school's area of focus will continue to  be the Instructional Core (1.2 Pedagogy) which requires consistent strategic planning of multiple entry points  particularly with our English Language Learners (ELLs), Students With Disabilities (SWDs), and our General Education  Students to demonstrate deep critical and analytical thinking skills through rigorous instruction. Monthly instructional  cabinet meetings are to be held to monitor and ensure that our curriculum is cohesive and consistent across all  grades. We are developing targeted lessons that will hone on the areas of weaknesses according to last year's NYS ELA  & Math Scores. In addition, we have allocated Tax Levy Fair Student and Title I SWP funding to provide our students  with intervention for after school and the Saturday Math Academy.

After conducting a comprehensive assessment, there is a need to improve our students’ benchmark levels to grade  level or above during independent reading time with a focus on comprehension. Research has found that learning  music facilitates learning other subjects and enhances skills that children inevitably use in other areas. A music rich  experience for children of singing, listening, and moving does benefit children as they progress into more formal  learning. Making music involves more than the voice or fingers playing an instrument; a child learning about music has  to tap into multiple skill sets, often simultaneously. Recent studies have clearly indicated that musical training  physically develops the left side of the brain known to be involved with processing language. Our strengths has  consistently been the following within the last several years:   99% of parents say that they are satisfied with the education their child received this year (City: 95%)   100% of teachers say that they would recommend their school to parents seeking a place for their child (City: 85%)           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   According to the Framework for Great Schools-Effective School Leadership, there is a need to increase student  engagement and improve reading comprehension in our primary grades K-2 (early childhood). Our early childhood  teachers have agreed to implement the approach of reciprocal teaching to help improve our student engagement and  reading comprehension. Reciprocal teaching is a research-based strategy that teaches students to work in small  groups to coordinate the use of four comprehension strategies: prediction, clarification, summarization, and student  generated questions. This is a strategy that asks students and teachers to share the role of teacher by allowing both to  lead the discussion about a given reading (text). This approach will benefit our student population that includes our  students with special needs, English Language Learners, and general education. The aim of strategy instruction is for  our students to become self-regulated learners. Reciprocal teaching is a great way to teach students how to  determine important ideas from a reading while discussing vocabulary, developing ideas, and questions, and  summarizing information. This strategy may be used across several content areas. As a result, students need to be  adept with a variety of comprehension strategies to ensure that our students’ have options if a particular strategy  proves ineffective. Our goal is to help our students understand that good readers do not use comprehension  strategies one at a time as they read, rather they orchestrate and coordinate a set of strategies to comprehend  complex non-fiction text. Our school strenghts have consistently been the following:   99% of parents say that they are satisfied with the education their child received this year (City: 95%)   100% of teachers say that they would recommend their school to parents seeking a place for their child (City: 85%)   Our school continues to score above the city average in the categories of the Framework for Great Schools which are  Trust, Effective Leadership, Supportive Environment, and Strong Family Community Ties.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, 60% or 3 out of 5 students in grades K-2 will increase student engagement through the research-based  approach of reciprocal teaching, proficiently as measured by our teacher-made assessments which includes checklists,  rubrics, and teacher observations. In accordance to the Framework for Great Schools-Effective School Leadership  cannot be established without the important element of trust amongst our staff and administration. In addition, we  now have a full time (ULIT) Universal Literacy Coach to support our new and veteran teachers with instructional  approaches & strategies. The ULIT classrooom is the instructional lab site for our teachers to observe demo lessons and  as a professional library. The ULIT will have scheduled coaching sessions to support our new teachers.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          24   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Special Education teachers collaboratively agreed to use GO Math RE- TEACH & Math Exemplars, Math and Reading Triumphs to address their students' needs.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 257, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Public School 257 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Beginning Thursday, November 1,  2018 through Thursday, April  4, 2019 for a total of 18 sessions, our ELLs will meet once a week  for 2 hours.  The program will meet on Thursdays from 2:45pm to 4:45pm.  Students will be  grouped according to their grade level and teachers will differentiate their instruction to meet the  needs of their entering, emerging, transitioning, and expanding students.  There will be a total of  five classes with groups ranging from 10 to 15 students.  Students will engage in hands on  activities and research content-based materials to conduct debates, reports, dramas, public  speaking, and projects while acquiring the English language.  This program will target the  English Language Learners in grades 1 through 5.  Students in grades 1 and 2 will focus on the  themes of families, plants, and weather and seasons.  Students in grades 3 and 4 will focus on the  themes of plant and animal adaptations and living environments, energy, and the interaction of  Air, Water, and Land. Students in grade 5 will focus on New York City and the various groups  of people that inhabit the city and their contributions to making it a great place to live.  As a  result of the Project Based Learning and the use of technology, students will engage in all 4  language learning modalities; reading, writing, listening, and speaking, in preparation for the  New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT).  Teachers will  focus, in greater depth to the writing modality as well as the enhancement and development of  academic language and vocabulary through the content areas. This program will be carried out  by two certified ENL teachers and three certified bilingual education teachers.  All instruction  will be in English with support in the student’s first language, Spanish.  In conjunction to the  teacher-made materials, students will receive supplemental support using NYSESLAT Prep  books which are not used throughout the school day.  These books provide the students with  sample questions and readings that will familiarize them to the format of the actual exam which  they will take in the Spring.  Student attendance will be taken on a weekly basis using generated  attendance sheets distributed by the pupil secretary and will be securely stored in the main  office.  All parent communication (program permission slips, invitations to Parent Engagement  Night) regarding the Title III program will be sent home in English and in  Spanish.  Interpretation will be provided at the request of the parent.

Teachers will meet  throughout the program for a total of 5 sessions for 1 hour to  discuss researched based articles and best practices to improve the writing skills and academic  vocabulary development of all our ELLs.  These professional development sessions are centered  around our two focuses for this year: writing and vocabulary.  These sessions will provide the  teachers with invaluable strategies that will greatly impact our students.  Teachers will track  student progress throughout the program and share that progress at these sessions.  This  information will provide valuable findings for the teachers to adapt their teaching to meet the  specific needs of their students.     Teachers will also be informed of any appropriate ELL workshops that are being provided by the  district and/or the Office of ELLs and will be given the option to attend.  Our teachers will  continue to turnkey information from workshops that they have attended for continued academic  support of our ELL population.   At every meeting teachers will be provided with an agenda listing all the topics to be discussed  as well as sign a sign-sheet as proof of attendance.  The agendas and sign-in sheets will be kept  in a binder and stored in the English as a New Language teacher's classroom.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  To assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs, our school uses multiple assessment tools.  These assessment tools include  Fountas and Pinnell Running Records, ELA Benchmark exams as well as teacher-created assessments and beginning fall 2017  will administer the newly revised Home Language Arts assessment provided by the Office of Assessments. These assessments  provide us with valuable information as to where the students are in terms of approaching, meeting, or exceeding the  standards in both English and Spanish.  The information then allows us to create lessons that are tailored to meeting the  specific needs of the students.  These assessments are administered monthly, quarterly as well as annually. As of right now,  many of our ELL students are reading below grade level and continue to struggle although much progress has been made in  other linguistic areas.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50   We have weekly meetings where teachers meet and discuss trends, strategies, and best practices to meet the needs of ELL  students.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  To evaluate the success of our ELL programs, the administration and ELL teachers look at various factors.  One of the main  factors is student progression on the NYSESLAT.  The results from this exam are a clear indication as to whether or not the  students have improved in their language acquisition.  Another tool used to evaluate the success of our ELL programs comes  from the tracking of our students' reading levels.  To track the progression of our students we use the Fountas and Pinnell  System.  Teachers conduct these assessments periodically (4 times a year).   Other factors include student portfolios and  overall student performance and progress in the classroom.          4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered, the Assistant Principals meet with the classroom teachers to discuss RtI sessions  to help address these needs.  In conjunction with the classroom teachers the ENL teachers also provide additional intervention  services throughout the instructional school day.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Every September teachers (Monolingual and Bilingual) with ELLs are given their students NYSESLAT scores.  This information is  gathered by our ENL teacher who retracts it from ATS.  The ENL teacher meets and discusses the findings and in collaboration  with the present teacher, discusses future plans on how to effectively meet the needs to help the students progress using  researched based strategies.  Teachers also use the Reading Wonders diagnostic assessments during the first weeks of school  to assess where the students' present level of performance are at.  Finally, teachers use the Fountas and Pinnell system to  assess the students reading levels as well as teacher created materials.  The students who are in the bottom third of the class  as well as those students who have either remained or regressed in their level of proficiency are placed in groups to receive  RtI.  These students either meet with their classroom teacher or are pulled out by an ENL teacher to be serviced.  Students  who are pulled out by an ENL teacher are serviced with their age appropriate peers regardless of their language proficiency  level.  Students are also serviced during our 10 week RtI after school program.  During this time, students are work closely with  their classroom teachers on phonemic awareness, sight words, fluency, comprehension and other reading strategies that will  help them progress with their reading capabilities.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   In order to plan and implement effective ELL programs, the data gathered from the NYSESLAT is critical to the evaluation  process.  The data gathered from this assessment inform us of the areas of greatest need of our students.  In addition to the  NYSESLAT scores using the ELL Data Analysis Tool is vital to the evaluation process.  The EDAT hones in on the students' needs  and provides an accurate overview of the students' progress or lack of from year to year.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   At the beginning of the school year, the ENL coordinator conducts a meeting with the Assistant Principal and Bilingual teachers  to discuss the findings from the NYSESLAT of the previous year.  The 2017 NYSESLAT data indicated that 18% of our ELL  students moved down one proficiency level, 25% of our ELL students moved up one proficiency level, .08% of our ELL students  moved up two proficiency levels, .04% of our students moved up three proficiency levels, and 46% of our ELL students  remained at their current level of language proficiency.  Although, there was an 83% gain, the EDAT indicated that our  students struggled in the writing and reading domains.  As a result to these findings, we have taken a closer look at our reading  and writing programs to determine if the curriculum being used is appropriate to meeting these needs.  We have also  established an ELL Task Force in which consist of an Assistant Principal, ENL teachers, and Bilingual teachers who meet on a  weekly basis to discuss student work and strategies to help meet their needs.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The Freestanding ENL program serves children in monolingual general and special education classes that require ENL  services.  The students are grouped by grade bands.  These bands are as follow; K, 1-2, 3-4 and 5. The students range  from all levels of language proficiency.  Students who scored Entering and Emerging on the NYSESLAT receive 360  minutes of instruction per week.  Students who scored Transitioning and Expanding on the NYSESLAT receive 180  minutes of instruction per week.  The Freestanding ENL program at our school serves as a push-in and pull-out  model.  During the push-in model, the ENL teachers work closely with the classroom teachers to plan, assess, and  execute effective lessons using ESL methods and strategies.  During these pull-out sessions, the ENL teachers focus  primarily on the methodologies and practices of TESOL to develop the English language needed for academic  success.  During the ENL class students receive instruction in English and when necessary and possible the child's  home language is used to clarify instruction.             b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     The Spanish to English Transitional Bilingual Education program serves children whose first language is Spanish. The  TBE classes are K, 1, 2-3 and 4-5 bridge.  The students range from all levels of language proficiency. Students who  scored Entering and Emerging on the NYSESLAT receive 360 minutes of English instruction per week. Students who  scored Transitioning and Expanding on the NYSESLAT receive 180 minutes of English instruction per week.  They also  receive 180 minutes of Native Language Arts instruction on a weekly basis.  Teachers across the grades make the  determination as to which content area will be taught in the home language.       c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   When it comes to the delivery of instructional minutets in our ENL class, the students who scored Entering and Emerging on  the NYSESLAT, receive 360 minutes of instruction per week.  The students who scored Transitioning and Expanding receive 180  minutes per week.  The students in our TBE program who scored Entering and Emerging on the NYSESLAT, receive 360 minutes  of instruction per week.  The students who scored Transitioning and Expanding receive 180 minutes of instruction.  The  students in the TBE program also receive 180 minutes of ELA and 45 minutes of NLA instruction daily.  Teachers in both  programs must create a classroom daily schedule.  On this schedule, the teachers must indicate the times and days that ENL,  ELA, and HLA instruction will be conducted according to the students in their classes.  These schedules are then presented to  the assistant principal assigned to the ELL programs.  After reviewing these schedules and making sure that the adequate  amount of instructional minutes are being provided according to proficiency levels by referring to the CR Part 154, the  assistant principal approves it.  If it is not approved, teachers must go back and revise their schedules accordingly.           3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   The ELLs in our K-5  th   grade, Spanish/English Transitional Bilingual Education Program benefit from a gradual acculturation  into the English language with native support.  The Balanced Literacy Model is used for our monolingual students, and English  Language Learners.  In the Balanced Literacy Model students read content area materials in Science, Math, and Social Studies   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      at their independent reading level, while following the curriculum guidelines for their grade.  The Balanced Literacy model  allows for differentiated instruction.  Our goal is to have students reading and writing on their appropriate grade level, or  above.  The English as a Second Language Pull-Out Program provides 100% of the instruction in English.  Students are allowed  to use their native language with their teacher and or peers to ask questions, express understanding, or ask for  clarification.  The teacher provides translations as needed.  Books in the native languages are available to support instruction  as well as for students to take home.  The ENL teachers provide services to all eligible students based on their performance on  NYSITELL or NYSESLAT.  Upon request, the ENL teachers will provide additional ENL services to at-risk bilingual students.  The  ENL teachers communicate daily with the classroom teachers to coordinate, and ensure the academic progress for our ELLs.     Our ELL students also acquire English through the use of ESL methodologies such as: Total Physical Response, Whole Language  Approach, Cooperative Learning, and Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach.  In addition, within our Balanced  Literacy Model which take place all in all classrooms, our ENL and some bilingual special education classes are using  MaxScholar.  MaxScholar is a comprehensive computer reading and language-based program.  Our ELLs in all classes also have  access to the myON library.  The myON library is a complete literacy solution that reinvents the ways in which students and  teachers interact with text.  It provides anytime, anywhere access to a library of more than 10,000 enhanced digital books with  multimedia supports, real-time reporting and assessments and embedded close reading tools. The myON library also has  books in Spanish. In addition to these resources, our ELL students have access to Learning A-Z which is an online education  technology company dedicated to expanding literacy through thoughtfully designed resources.     The core contents throughout the various TBE classes are taught differently.  Teachers are given the option as to which core  content area they are going to choose to teach in the native language.  Teachers have materials in books as well as through  technology to support their instruction.  The ENL teachers provide content support for ELLs in their programs by working  closely with the classroom teachers and creating lesson plans/units of study that they implement during the pull-out time  slots.  Students are explicitly taught academic vocabulary and content material.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   We ensure that all Transitional Bilingual ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language throughout the year by doing  the following: First, when the student does not score commanding on the NYSITELL, the Spanish LAB-R is administered.  The  results of the Spanish LAB-R are used to plan instruction during the NLA period of instruction. Throughout the year the  students are taught the required minutes of NLA and are given teacher created tests in their native language, ensuring that  they build their skills in their native language while acquiring the English language.  Summaries of all English lessons are  conducted in Spanish.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    We differentiate instruction for ELL subgroups by doing the following:  a. SIFE - Our SIFE student is placed in a TBE class and receives additional instructional support by one of our TBE special  education teachers throughout the day.  This SIFE student is taught the skills in which he is lacking in his native language  (Spanish) in order to help him transfer those skills to the English language.    b. Newcomer - Our newcomer students are in our TBE classes.  They receive RtI with their classroom teachers.  In addition,  these students are also provided 180 minutes of English as a New Language by our ENL teachers.      c. Developing - ELLs that are receiving services for 4-6 years are in our Special Education classes and are receiving all mandated  services per their IEP goals.      d. Long Term - Presently we don't have any long term ELLs.      e. Former ELLs - ELLs who have passed the NYSESLAT receive 90 minutes of ENL services for 2 years by one of our ENL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      teachers.  All former ELL students continue to receive testing accommodations such as extended time, separate locations, and  other accommodations as per the IEP during the 2 year expansion.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    For our ELLs including ELL-SWDs we use a varitey of TESOL strategies to accelerate English language development.  These  strategies include metacognitive, cognitive and socioaffective.  Students are taught and exposed to these strategies all  throughout the year.  These strategies include think alouds, the use of graphic organizers, repeated readings, readers theatre,  and cooperative learning which help students work independently and with others while accessing academic content through  our social studies and science curriculum's as well as through our school wide reading program, Reading Wonders.  Our  classroom teachers also use a variety of online programs that enhance student learning and language progressions such as  Reading Wonders, MaxScholar, myON virtual library, and other free online resources.  In all bilingual classes, classroom  libraries are set up to have both English and Spanish reading books.  The administration has also made it a priority to ensure  that all bilingual classes have core content trade books that correspond to the science and social studies curriculum being used  on the grade.  To ensure that ELL-SWDs receive all services mandated on their IEPs, the administration has a copy of all service  providers schedules and periodically check in with them. The administration also checks in with the classroom teachers to  verify that the students are indeed receiving the mandated services.  To ensure that ELL-SWDs whose IEP mandates ENL  instruction receive an appropriate program, the special education coordinator, the assistant principal assigned to ELLs and the  ENL coordinator meet and discuss the mandated minutes and how to create schedules.  The information is then put into the  STARS tracking system.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our ESL ELL-SWDs that are in monolingual classes are mainstreamed with regular education.  These students receive RtI from  both their classroom teachers, the ENL teacher and a service provider.  Many of the students receive academic intervention  from our SETSS, Speech, OT/PT, Bilingual Psychologist, and Bilingual Counselor.  The students in TBE classrooms also benefit  from the help and support from the teacher's assistant in the classroom.  Our school also provides after school NYSESLAT test  prep classes that focus on specific skills and areas of weaknesses that the students have.  Students that are doing well in all of  the content areas are offered enrichment programs such as: piano, dance, chorus, trumpet, and drums.  To have our ELL-SWDs  in an environment with their non-disabled peers, our teachers and providers have now adopted the push-in model.  Teachers  and providers now go into the classroom and provide their services amongst the students peers.  Our ELL-SWDs learn along  side their peers with the extra support while not being removed from their environment.             8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our ELLs receive targeted intervention depending on the areas in which they lack.  This intervention is provided in the form of  RtI during the instructional school day.  This intervention is provided by the bilingual classroom teacher and ENL teacher.  Most  of our ELLs receive targeted intervention instruction in ELA. This intervention focuses on developing, improving, and enhancing  the reading and writing skills of our ELLs.   The main subgroup of ELLs targeted this year for intervention are our newcomers.  Our newcomers receive RtI for 180 minutes  a week by one of our ENL teachers to help with the acquisition of the English language.    These intervention services are offered in English with support in the home language.  TBE teachers provide their intervention  for the core content classes in the home language.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on the data from the 2017 NYSESLAT and ELA assessments, our records indicate that our newcomer and developing ELL  students require additional support in the reading and writing modalities.  To address these needs, the following  programs; MaxScholar, and Pearsons' Cornerstone curriculum will be considered for the upcoming school year.  Both programs  are designed to provide the individualized instruction and support based on where the students are at.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      At this moment there are no programs or services for ELLs that will be discontinued.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our school is fortunate to have great school programs throughout the day and afterwards as well.  Before leaving our school,  all students who begin in kindergarten and remain until 5  th   grade will have received physical education, art, music, dance,  library, and technology instruction during the day.  They also have the opportunity to join after school clubs that include  ballerinas, piano, drum line, trumpets, and chorus.  Our ELL students also have the opportunity to participate in the Title III  after school program.  This program is specifically designed to meet to their needs and prepare them for the NYSESLAT.  They  are also afforded the opportunity to attend the winter and spring ELL academies during the weeks of vacation.  These services  are free of charge and are tailored to meeting the needs of all our ELLs.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Technology is a major force in our school.  As a result of that, all classrooms including cluster classrooms have SmartBoards.  Teachers utilize these Smartboards all throughout the year as they make learning come alive through interactive lessons and  having the ability to show movies.  A laptop cart which contains 30 laptops is also readily available for student use.  Students  conduct research and type up reports on these laptops.  Our ELLs are also encouraged to use these resources for translation  purposes as well.  The use of the MaxScholar reading and language online programs makes learning the basic structures and  phonetic elements of the English language engaging and interesting for our ELLs.  This program taps into the various learning  styles of our learners. For example, there are auditory, kinesthetic, and visual aids throughout every stage of the program.  The  Reading Wonders online component also makes learning engaging and interesting.  To support learning for all learners the use  of visual aids and maps, labeling, use of realia and manipulatives are incorporated throughout the lessons and in the  classrooms.  The use of the native language is also used to scaffold and provide support for the entering and emerging  students.  TBE classrooms have core content trade books as well as literature in their native language in which students can  use to conduct research as well as for enjoyment.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   To support home language in the TBE, 45 minutes of NLA is provided everyday.  TBE classrooms have bilingual libraries in  which students can read a book in either language they feel more comfortable.  The online components of Reading Wonders  provides a Spanish component in which teachers utilize in their classrooms.  TBE teachers also encourage their students to use  the myON virtual library which provides them with thousands of books in Spanish.  TBE classrooms also use labels (in both  Spanish and English) to help support student learning and awareness of everyday English words and meanings.  To support  home language in the ENL classroom, students are encouraged to use translation guides as well as bilingual  dictionaries.  Depending on the language, the ENL teachers are also able to provide some support in the native language.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    To ensure that all required services and resources correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels, a team of bilingual teachers and  an administrator meet regularly.  All curriculum chosen must be Common Core aligned and reflect a level of academic rigor  that is age and developmentally appropriate.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our school does not share the building with another school or entity.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   There are multiple activities that newly enrolled ELLs and their families are invited to attend.  These activities include Open- House in which the families get a tour of the school in the language of their preference.  The families get a general idea as to  the school environment, culture and what it has to offer for their child.  During this visit, the administration makes themselves   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         available to meet and greet these new incoming families.  Families are also encouraged to attend PTA meetings and workshops  that are held by our Parent Coordinator and PTA President. At these gatherings, parents receive pertinent information  regarding the school and upcoming events.  Another activity that is offered to our newly enrolled ELLs and their families is the  Parent Orientation.  At this orientation, the families and the child have an opportunity to meet and greet with many people in  which they will interact with on a daily basis.  These people include the ENL teacher, Bilingual teachers, administrators and  Parent Coordinator.  All of these activities are conducted in the preferred language of the parent(s).        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All of our staff participates in ongoing, long-term staff development with a strong emphasis on the Common Core State  Standards and high impact differentiated and academic language development strategies for all our learners; ELLs, ELL- SWDs.  All of our teachers received the calendar of professional development offered by the Office of English Language  Learners.  They are encouraged to register for classes in order to increase their instructional knowledge of best practices  allowing them to better target the diverse academic needs of English Language Learners, as well as analyze student data to  drive instruction.  The ENL teacher attends all appropriate ELL professional development sessions, and turnkeys professional  development for our bilingual teachers, pupil accounting secretary, and parent coordinator.  Our ELL Inquiry Collaboration  Team meets on a bi-weekly basis to discuss our targeted group which consist of 10 students; five first and third grade students.  This team consists of bilingual and special education bilingual teachers as well as the ENL coordinator and the assistant  principal who is responsible for the ELL programs at our school.       To continue the professional growth of our bilingual teachers including our ENL teachers, weekly and monthly ELL related  professional developments are offered.  The weekly ELL meetings are held by the ENL coordinator.  At these meetings, the ENL  teacher disseminates new information coming from the Office of English Language Learners or any upcoming changes or  assessments that are going to be implemented throughout the school.  The weekly meetings are also facilitated by our  bilingual teachers.  At these meetings, our bilingual teachers share best practices and strategies that they are using to help  students progress.  The monthly meetings held at our school are open to all bilingual and  ENL teachers as well as ENL  coordinators/administrators throughout the district.  These meetings are held by ELL specialists from the office of the  superintendent.  At these monthly meetings discussions and data about ELLs across the district take place and about what  strategies and best practices can be implemented to help our ELLs succeed.  As a result to these monthly meetings, our school  has formed an ELL Inquiry Team.  This team meets once a week to discuss a small selected group of student data and strategies  that can be used to help these students succeed in all aspects of their educational career.  Our ELL teachers also meet with the  monolingual teachers, in order to ensure that weekly lesson plans are aligned with those of the monolingual classes reflecting  the NYS CCSS.  Teachers are also permitted to attend professional developments provided by the Office of English Language  Learners throughout the year.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As per CR Part 154.2, our professional development/learning schedule will reflect the 50% of total hours for bilingual/ENL  teachers and 15% of total ELL hours for all teachers.  These professional development/learning hours will be conducted  throughout our weekly mandated scheduled development hours.  At every meeting teachers must sign in and are given an  agenda to maintain and keep for their personal records.  The sign in sheets and agendas are kept in a binder in the ELL  coordinators room.  In conjunction with these embedded hours of PD, teachers are encouraged to attend workshops offered  by the United Federation of Teachers, Department of English Language Learners, as well as any other N.Y.C. Department of  Education approved agency.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents are informed about the program, their child's progress and other matters pertaining to their education on a frequent  basis.  Parents can meet with their child's teacher on a weekly basis, receive phone calls or email updates as well.  This year  across all grades a digital form of communication was implemented.  Classroom teachers can now communicate and  disseminate information to parents through a Class Dojo account.  Parents are capable of tracking their child's progress as well  as receive daily/weekly alerts and reminders.  All information whether on paper or via the Internet is done in both English and  the home language of the students' parents.  At our school there are specific teachers that are utilized to translate all  notifications being sent home.  If the school has no personnel to translate information being sent home, the school will then  contact the Interpretation and Translation Unit of the New York City Department of Education. Parent and teacher  communication are very important for the success of the child.        2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents are involved in our school in a myriad of ways.  Our parent coordinator helps parents with all issues. Translations are  provided during all workshops, and meetings are conducted in the preferred language of the parent(s).  The parental  community is very much involved with our Parent Teacher Association.  The parent coordinator holds monthly parent  meetings.  All parents of English Language Learners and Special Education students are invited to participate in all  programs.  We will continue to conduct workshops during the evenings in order to increase the participation of working  parents.    The ENL teacher and Parent Coordinator offer parents of newly enrolled English Language Learners a two-hour Parent  Orientation workshop, with materials, in their native language.  The orientation explains both our Transitional Bilingual  Education and ENL programs as well as the third model, Dual Language.  This orientation also offers the parents an opportunity  to choose the instructional program that best meets the instructional needs of their child.  The orientation workshop takes  place five days of the students' enrollment into the New York City Educational system.  When we encounter parents of new  ELLs that speak another language other than Spanish, we offer an orientation in English, and the parents are provided an  interpreter and materials in their native language.  At the orientation workshop, we review the State Standards, assessments,  school expectations and general program requirements for bilingual education and or freestanding ENL program.  The parents  are encouraged to attend, in order to make an informed decision when choosing a program model.    Parents also participate in maintaining and operating the school Lending Library. These parents volunteer their time and  efforts to make learning and reading enjoyable for the students.  Our parent coordinator is actively involved in all aspects of  the school as she advocates for the all parents and their needs.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Brian Leavy-devale, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S. 257                                                                              School DBN: 14K257  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      All parents/guardians of newly enrolled students fill out a Home Language Survey when enrolling their child. This  form is maintained as part of the student’s record. If the parent/guardian indicates on the HLIS that they would  like to receive information from the school in their home language, forms being sent home are translated either in  written form or orally to the parent/guardian. Information from teachers is also translated to parents by staff  members who speak the home language. There are currently 82 ELLs at P.S.257. 78 parents have requested  information to be sent in Spanish. Othewise, no other parents have requested information to be sent home in a  language other than English. However, the DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit will be utilized if a  parent/guardian should request these services. This was indicated on the HLIS as well as confirmed orally by a  pedagogue who speaks the parents' home language. During parent orientation, the parents provide requests for  language preference and they document their language preference on the emergency contact cards. Parent  surveys are distributed in Spanish, the language requested, as well as English which has been requested by the  parents. The ATS Report of Preferred Languages is updated regularly in order to maintain accurate information on   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      parent language choices ( RAPO ATS Report). Parent Blue Cards are also updated regularly to keep parent  language choices current. Parent surveys are given out by the parent coordinator in order to maintain accurate  data on parent language choices. Teachers also send home surveys by backpack or during parent conferences in  order to collect parent data by class/grade. A report is generated using a variety of data sets in order to regularly  update the languages that parents speak by class and/or grade.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    Approximately eighty-six  percent of the school’s  population reports English as  the primary language. The  remaining fourteen percent  speak Arabic, Bengali,  Cantonese, and Spanish. The  school’s demographic is made  available on the school’s  official DOE website. Teachers  whose parents have elected to  receive information in their  home language have had this  information communicated to  them by the ENL  teacher/coordinator. 78  parents have requested  information sent in Spanish.  This was indicated on the HLIS  as well as through oral  communication with the office  staff and classroom teachers.  This information is translated  to parents by staff members  who speak the same home  language. All other language  needs are met through the  utilization of the DOE  Translation and Interpretation  Unit.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu).

How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Parent surveys are distributed at the beginning of the school year which gather feedback from parents on the quality  and availability of services. The ENL teacher also meets individually with all parents/guardians of ELLs and can then  also ascertain the needs and concerns that they may have. These meetings occur periodically. After such meetings,  the ENL teacher confers with the parent coordinator, classroom teachers, and the administration in order to discuss  the needs of the parents/guardians and students.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65
