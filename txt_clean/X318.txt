The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and informed by New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          7     comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement      NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          9        Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Implement at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify   the instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content  standards; provide time for collaboration on the use of) beginning no later than the 2018-19 school year.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.      Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?  The MSTA mission is produce strong readers, writers and mathematicians prepared for high school, college and  careers in a future dominated by science and technology.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, including   a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   MSTA is a middle school with approximately 283 students from grades six through eight. The school population is  comprised of 70% Hispanic, 26% Black, and 1% White. The student body includes 16% English Language Learners and  29% Students with Disabilities. Boys account for 56% of the students enrolled and girls account for 44%. During the  2017 -18 school year, the NYC school survey indicated that although we are above average when compared to the city  in our relationship with families and community (3.47) we are below average when compared to the city in terms of  rigorous instruction, collaborative teachers (2.98) and supportive environment (2.71). Our goal this year is to create  the supportive and collaborative conditions that are necessary for rigorous instruction to take place.   The following are a brief listing of instructional structures and established strategic community collaborations that are  woven into the fabric of teaching, learning and growth at MSTA:     Adaptive Learning Technologies: We are utilizing adaptive learning technology such as Khan Academy and  Wordly Wise in traditional classroom lessons as well as in stand-alone self-paced computer labs. The use of  adaptive learning technology offers students practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized  learning dashboard that empower them to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom.     Matisse Foundation: MSTA is one of six selected NYC public schools will receive $100,000 each year for five  consecutive years (2018-2023) to implement an arts education program built around our unique needs and  interests. We are working to partner with Tribeca Film Institute's educational programs, as well as expand our  music program to having multiple performance groups.     Children's Aid: As our CBO and community school partner they support out engaging of family to ensure that   students succeed not only in the classroom, but also with the greater community.     Restorative Justice Circle: At MSTA we build relationships with students and families through Talking Circles to   address conflict within our community. We use Circles to create safe spaces, build connections and offer  teachers a unique means of formative assessment.     High School Readiness (Regents in the 8th Grade): All students are given the opportunity to be prepared to   take up to 5 NYS Regents exams including, Algebra, Living Environment, English Language Arts, US History and  Spanish LOTE.     College Access for All- Middle School Cohort for 7th Grade.     3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   During the 2016-2017 school year, our ELA scores increased by twelve percentage points from 10 percent to 22  percent. Upon review of the data, it was determined that while our general education students were able to move  towards proficiency in ELA, our SWD and ENL students did not make similar gains. According to the 2017 ELA test,  only three percent of SWD and zero ENL students at MSTA reached proficiency in the 2017 NYS ELA exam. In Math,  86% of the students performed at Levels 1 and 2. The majority of ENL and SWD were grouped in Level 1 with at least  70% in that level. During 2017-2018 school year our focus was on differentiating instruction for SWD and ENL students  so that they can make instructional gains and thereby increasing the percentage of proficient of students on both the  NYS ELA and MATH exams. For the 2018-2019 school year we are adding instructional strategies to further the  proficiency growth of all students at MSTA. We are increasing the use of Integrated Co-Teaching models across all  classrooms, as well adaptive learning technology and small group instruction to provide remediation and enrichment.     4.  Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over the   past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          11      During the 2017-2018 year we continued to be celebrated for the implementation of recommendations and strategies  to ensure that curricula is aligned to CCLS and/or content standards and the making of purposeful decisions to build  coherence and promote college and career readiness for all students. The curricula and academic tasks were planned  and refined using student work and data so that a diversity of learners, including ELLs and SWDs, have access to the  curricula and tasks and are cognitively engaging. As a result more teachers are creating more scripted lessons, pre- scripted questions and anticipated answers from students and making predictions for any misconceptions that may  surface.       5.  Identify at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify the   instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content standards;  provide time for collaboration on the use of data) to be implemented in the 2018-19 school year.

Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction  (DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and  address student achievement needs.  The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner  within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the  arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities.  Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative  assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student  reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.   3.3   3.4   3.5   SOP(s)   Addressed   X   X   X               Part 1b.

Reflection & Strength:   CCLS are being implemented with high school, college and career and readiness as the end goal. All MSTA curriculum  not only takes into account student needs as assessed by the various data points, including the Quality Review, Principal  Performance Observation, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, and the New York  State Mathematics & English Language Arts exam results. They also take into account teacher readiness and ability to  plan and implement effective classroom instruction as assessed through informal and formal classroom observation,  student performance data analysis and looking at student work. Each school year begins with Mathematics & English  Language Arts baseline assessments not only ascertain student readiness, but also assess proper implementation of  CCLS. The baseline assessments are followed by a series of interim assessments to measure student proficiency and  growth. The gathered data drives MSTA's use and implementation of Data Driven Instruction and Inquiry to heighten  teacher pedagogy and student manipulation of complex materials and higher-order questioning. Teachers work  collaboratively, both in content-specific departments and interdisciplinary grade-level teams. In content specific  departments, teachers ensure that content-specific instruction are aligned to CCLS and provide a clear articulation to  ensure effective student development through individualized subject areas. This is further enhanced in interdisciplinary  grade-level teams in which teachers create learning opportunities for students in to connect their learning through  project-based learning aligned to real-world tasks. (SOP 3.2, 3.3, 3.4). Survey results from the NYC School Survey  indicates that our highest need is the Quality of Student Discussion under the Rigorous Instruction Category with less   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          15      than half af all teachers indicating that students build on each other ideas and provide constructive feedback to their  students.   Needs:   School leadership will strengthen teacher pedagogy and ensure that tasks consistently reflect the instructional shifts  demanded by CCLS. There needs to be a consistency in monitoring instruction through the formal observation process  and informal observations to measure the impact on student learning while rating teacher practice. We will revisit  expectations for data driven instruction and student engagement.   Informed by Capacity Framework Element - Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and  aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious  intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. This needs assessment informed the development of the  annual goal listed below.

Reflection & Strengths:   We have set community expectation for students, families, all staff members, as well as administration. These  expectations communicate a clear understanding of our sense of urgency in educating all students in our school  community. These expectations are explicitly stated in both staff and the student & family handbook. Student learn  about these expectations formally being the annual induction during advisory classes held weekly on Monday  afternoons. This is distributed during our Back To School Night in September. It is also made available on the school  website and through the MSTA Google document drive. All members of our community, not only students, are expected  to be able to articulate the expectations of the school. We use iO Classroom, a data capture system, to gather student  data i.e. assignments, assessments, and behavior anecdotal reports. It is updated daily. All members of the MSTA  community are charged with collaboratively creating a calm, peaceful and friendly environment where all students are  known by name and character. All MSTA staff member take on the responsibility of supporting the academic and  personal growth of all students. Our community Expectations lay the foundation of a positive experience for all of our  students. Families are partners in creating an environment in which everyone is welcomed, supported and safe. The  restorative circle is our structural framework for building relationships and addressing conflict within the MSTA  community, as well as an instructional strategy for optimizing learning in the classroom.

Data from   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          21      the NYC survey indicated that our highest area of need is peer support for academic work (1.33) which was below the  city and district average.      Needs:   Although expectations are communicated through school-wide assemblies and communications, not all of the students  feel included in our community as reflected by the School Environment Survey. We are further embedding structures  and supports to help students build positive relationships with one another, to help adults build positive relationships  with students, and to foster the development of a supportive and positive community with clear expectations and high  standards of personal conduct. This is why we are investing resources to have all staff members trained in facilitating  restorative circles. In addition, we are partnering with our CBO Children's Aid Society in order to provide success  mentors that will support students with their academic work and attendance.      This is informed by Capacity Framework Element – Supportive Environment, our most current PFQR, and the school’s  current data, there is a need to continue develop consistent school wide programs to support our stakeholders'  capacities to create a safe, nurturing, and supportive learning environment, thereby increasing academic success for all  students .         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, as a result of restorative circle training that all teachers will receive the number of negative anecdotal  entries in IO Classroom/Skedula regarding student behavior and Level I &II OORS entries will decrease by 50%.               2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          22     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies your  school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this  Framework for Great Schools element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Reflection & Strengths   We continue to refine the process in order to purposefully evaluate and adjust the use of organizational resources, and  the quality of teacher teamwork and professional development practices, with particular attention to what teachers  need to learn to support student mastery of the CCLS . However, the next steps listed below were not implemented with  fidelity. Therefore, the principal continually evaluates the quality of school-level decisions, making adjustments as  needed to increase the coherence of policies and practices across the school, with particular attention to the CCLS. We  have a process in place to purposefully evaluate and adjust curricular and instructional practices, and are becoming  more intentional in decision making to align coaching to teacher needs and closer monitoring to increase its  effectiveness in response to student learning needs and the expectations of the CCLS. There is a particular focus on  building alignment and coherence between what is taught (as would be evident in increased rigor in tasks) and how (as  would be evident in classroom lessons) it is taught, so that there is evidence across all classrooms in delivery of  instruction and in student work products.

We are seeking high  leverage practices that can begin to build the instructional foundation across content and grade levels. For example,  annotation of a text is consistently implemented across the classroom, then add Cornell Note strategy as another  coherent practice and slowly build school-wide academic behaviors aligned to the IB guidelines. Adaptive learning  technology, such as Khan Academy and Google classroom, will also be implemented into core content subjects .

Reflection & Strengths      Based on 2017-2018 Principal Performance Observation, there was evidence of a common instructional practices in  most classrooms that consists of guiding question, learning objectives, vocabulary, inquiry, and assessment. Teachers  make an effort to employ elements of the workshop model with varying degree of successes. Over the course of the  school year there was a marked improvement in teachers’ practice from the fall to the spring. Students attempt to use  accountable talk in their classroom interactions. While students are clear on what they need to do for a given task for  the most part, they were not as ready with why they are doing it other than “practice for the state test.” Teachers used  time as the driver in their instruction and miss the opportunity to build students comprehension. Across classrooms, the  instruction is dominated by the teacher(s) and not enough attention was paid to student mastery. (SOP 2.4). Data from  the NYC survey indicated that our highest area of need is teacher influence with only 56% of teachers stating that they a  moderate to great deal of influence of the instructional materials used in the classroom.      2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          31      Needs:   Identification of instructional priorities (aligned to the school-wide beliefs) and make curricular modifications to ensure  that there is intellectual engagement and high levels of student thinking, analysis, and challenging tasks.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          46      achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          47      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy      Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. MSTA, School of Mathematics, Science and Technology , in compliance with the  Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.   MSTA’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.             Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   MSTA will support parents and families of Title I students by:     Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math and use of technology;   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          48           Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;   Parental Involvement and School Quality   In developing the MSTA Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of  the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.

Our Title III program is intended  to complement, enhance, and amplify the learning that occurs in the classroom using the  common core standards and aligned instruction.      The data utilized to inform the Title III programming includes the 2017 NYSESLAT scores,  examined in detail by language modality to determine English proficiency levels and specific  areas of strength and weakness.  In addition, the number of years enrolled in the NYC DOE has  been used to determine more information about the sub groups.  Finally, SESIS has been utilized  to identify ELLs with disabilities in order to further differentiate instruction to meet their needs.      Amongst these students, 14 of them are students with disabilities and 1 is a SIFE.  In addition to  this quantitative data, teacher observations and one on one conferences have also been used to  assess the progress of ell students and provide a more complete picture.  For example, some  students with disabilities who have difficulty with test taking may be more proficient in English  than their test scores indicate.  This data will play a role in the way that students are grouped in  the Title III programs, as well as the resources which they will receive.       Our two Title III programs will target and serve newcomers, developing ells, long term ells, and  ells with disabilities by providing differentiated instruction that is inclusive of a range of learning  styles after school.  The programs are intended for grades 6, 7, and 8.      After school instruction will occur on Wednesdays and Thursdays beginning on the second week  in October and lasting for two hours from 2:30 pm to 4:30 pm.  This program will meet for 48  sessions.  Saturday Academy will begin in January in preparation for state ELA exam, Math  exam, and NYSESLAT.  Saturday Academy will begin at 9 am and conclude at 12 pm.  There  will be 14 sessions of Saturday Academy.      The language of instruction will be English with the students’ home languages incorporated into  the instruction.  Home language resources will include, but will not be limited to, glossaries and  dictionaries in the students’ home languages and multilingual texts whenever available.  In  addition, students will have frequent opportunities to use their home language in the classroom  during the  discussion of content.        The after school program will be taught by certified ENL teachers, Brad Ludwin and  Omosefe Ogbebor.  This program will provide direct ENL instruction for newcomers.  This  program will utilize elements of the SIOP model and the Common Core Progressions to provide  these students with access to the standards while also developing language using sheltered  instructional methods.  The program will incorporate the arts and technology to engage students   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          54         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   in academic vocabulary development, and will also emphasize activities which promote oral  language in the classroom.        Saturday Academy will be taught by an ENL teacher, an ELA teacher, and a Math teacher.  This  program will target ELLs who received a 1 on both the ELA and Math state tests, as well as  ELLs who are taking the ELA exam for the first time.  Students will be divided into two groups,  and will receive ELA and Math instruction from the content teachers for an hour and a half  each.  The ENL teacher will provide language support for an hour and a half to each group using  the team teaching model during the ELA sessions.             Materials for the program will include multimedia resources, leveled texts with visual  amplifications, technology including laptops and a smartboard, hands on art materials for project  based learning, cameras, film,  and audio books.  In preparation for state testing, students will  receive NYSESLAT preparation materials and Ready NY workbooks for ELA and Math.      In order to keep accurate records of these programs, all after school and Saturday sessions will  have attendance taken for teachers and students.  In addition, lesson plans will also be submitted  for instruction.  Parents will receive letters of notification of the programs offered for their  children and phone calls home will be made to further reach out.  Hard copies of these records  will be maintained in a binder, and phone calls home will be logged on Skedula.com.           rationale  teachers to receive training   schedule and duration  topics to be covered  name of provider   Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.    ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  Begin description here:               All teachers deliver instruction to ells in varied capacities, so it is essential that MSTA provides  professional development for Title III teachers as well as the remainder of the staff.  Teachers  delivering instruction both in the Title III program and during the school day will receive  targeted professional development centered on best practices for English Language Learners by  both the Assistant Principal, Ms. Dotel. and the ENL teacher, Mr. Ludwin.  These teachers will  also participate in outside professional development opportunities during the course of the school  year.    A schedule of topics to be covered by Ms. Dotel (AP) and Mr. Ludwin during after school PDs  on Mondays are listed below.  The total number of trainings will be five, and with each  description is included an explanation of how the instruction will positively impact ELLs in the  classroom.  Because these training will be conducted during contractual PD time, they will not  be at a cost to the program.     2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          55         Part C: Professional Development   November 6th, 2018: Using Schema to Activate Background Knowledge During Instruction for  ELLs (45 minutes) Teachers will learn how building background knowledge prior to introducing  new content or texts makes input more comprehensible for English language learners.  They will  explore the use of visuals, both photos and film, as a method to amplify and complement the  texts being read.   December 11th, 2018:  Developing Academic Vocabulary for ELLs (45  minutes) Teachers will examine the importance of vocabulary development for English language  learners, and will learn a range of student centered activities that they can implement in the  classroom, including interactive word walls, vocabulary recall games, and flashcards.    January  22nd, 2019: Scaffolding Writing for ELLs (45 minutes) Teachers will examine and explore ELL  writing strategies, including sentence frames and graphic organizers to improve written work in  the classroom and plan language objectives.  February 12th, 2019: Creating an inclusive  classroom for ESL students (45 minutes) Teachers will examine ways to incorporate students’  identities into text selections and written assignments.  They will explore the works of authors  from ethnic groups that represent the student population and consider how to include these  writers in classroom instruction.      March 19th, 2019: Using the Bilingual Common Core Progressions to Design Language  Objectives:  Teachers will use the bilingual common core progressions to align their work with  ELLs more closely to the standards,  They will examine how to adapt and adjust content so that  it is accessible to all learners.  Teachers will learn how to embed language instruction into  content.      In addition to these PDs, Mr. Ludwin, as the certified ENL teacher, will attend weekly ELA  meetings and provide support to ELA teachers who are working with ELLs in their  classrooms.  He will also be meeting with the remaining content departments monthly to design  scaffolds for ELLs in those courses.      Mr. Ludwin will also receive his own professional development throughout the year.  He will  attend monthly ELL liaison meetings conducted by Karyna Tejeda, the ELL Services  Coordinator for district 12, where he will receive professional development on ELL  instruction.  He will then turnkey this information to Ms. Dotel and the staff at school based  PDs.  Finally, Mr. Ludwin will receive regular feedback from his Assistant Principal, Suleika  Dotel, who is herself a trained ENL pedagogue with years of experience teaching ELLs.  These  PDs will not be at a cost to the program because they will take place during the school day.    Records of all ELL professional development sessions will be maintained with an agenda,  attendance sheet, and minutes recorded by a designated person to document the topics  discussed.  These three components will be saved on the school’s google drive, and hard copies  will be stored in a binder.

Parents of students who are involved in the school or who  are learning English themselves will be able to support their children and provide role models for  success.      Workshops on topics specifically supporting parents of English language learners will be offered  at the school by our Parent Coordinator, ENL Teacher, Assistant Principal and in partnership  with our community based organization, The Children's Aid Society.   In addition, we will be  providing adult ENL classes for parents who wish to develop their English skills as well as  information sessions on topics of our community’s choosing, such as immigration policy and  processes.      We will also be designing school wide activities that will rely on the help of our immigrant  parents and speakers of other languages, including cultural awareness days connected to  classroom instruction.  Finally, parents will be invited to the school for writing celebrations  during which student work will be read aloud and commended by peers and parents.  These  celebrations will be scheduled at the discretion of the individual classroom teachers and will  correspond with the end of each writing unit.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?    In order to assess the early literacy skills for our English Language Learners we currently use the New York State Identification  Test for English Language Learners (NYSITELL) along with the Spanish LAB for native Spanish speakers.  These tests provide us  insight into our ELL students English and Spanish language proficiency.   The data given is used in order to guide teacher  instruction, curriculum planning and student scheduling.  All ELLs complete writing benchmarks and performance series  computer based exams in reading.  All ELLs take a teacher created literacy assessment at the start of each unit of study.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          60      The school has an instructional cabinet, which has developed a common core aligned curriculum with pre-determined  formative assessments.  All assessments are given to the teachers in advance, and the administration dates and scoring  deadlines are predetermined on the pacing calendar for ELA.  Mr. Ludwin provides input on how assessments should be  differentiated for English language learners.    In addition, Mr. Ludwin provides ENL professional development sessions on Mondays for all teachers after school.  These are  given multiple times each year.  ENL teachers meet weekly with the general educator whom they co-teach with.  During this common planning time, time, the  two teachers collaborate to ensure that all ELLs are able to access the content through ENL strategies that have been  developed over time.  Finally, Mr. Ludwin is a member of the SIT.  During SIT meetings, the needs of ELLs with disabilities are addressed through  student work analysis and other interventions and inquiries.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Performance Series for Reading and Math are used to identify baselines, mid year benchmarks and end of year  benchmarks.  In addition, I-Ready performance mastery is used as a summative assessment at the end of each ELA unit of  study.  The NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data are also used as a baseline to determine English language proficiency levels, and a  mock NYSESLAT is given to all ELLs in February to measure progress and prepare for the exam.    The NYSESLAT data is broken down into the four modalities and examined closely to determine on an individual basis students'  strengths and weaknesses, and an action plan is formed to target these areas for growth.    These assessments have determined that an area of need is additional support for both long term ells, as well as ells with  IEPs.  The data shows that these two subgroups are not showing the same growth as their peers.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The AIS program provides additional support to struggling readers as identified by the data.  Students work in small groups of  five with a teacher weekly to hone in on important literacy standards.  The ENL program is well developed and clearly defined,  so that ELLs receive their services based on the results of the NYSESLAT.  Students with the least proficiency in English are  entitled to the most support in both stand alone and integrated ENL instruction.    Based on the data from the summative assessments, students are enrolled in our Title III program after school, as well as on  Saturdays in the spring.  This program offers additional interventions and supports for the students who need it most.  In the  Title III Programs, ELLs develop their English literacy skills using a curriculum that is hands on, creative, and incorporates  technology into the classroom.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The IEP teacher provides additional support for students who need an Rti.  She works in collaboration with the ENL pedagogue  to ensure that ELLs are given every opportunity to succeed without restriction.  Together they determine whether a student is  struggling because of the language barrier, or if their are other factors impacting their achievement.    Teachers use a universal RtI template for collecting qualitative data, and they report to the IEP Teacher, Dr. Shelton, with their  findings in a weekly meeting.  Teachers also communicate about interventions for ELLs at department meetings, and Mr.  Ludwin, Mr. Herrera, and Ms. Ogbebor provide helpful insight and suggest strategies to support the English learners.    Within AIS, students are regularly assessed using the i-Ready program for reading and math.  ELLs who have been selected to  participate in AIS take both a pre and post assessment quarterly.  The ELLs enrolled in this AIS program may cycle in and out  based on the i-Ready data each quarter.    Staff members maintain a data binder in their classrooms.  This contains all state test scores and classroom assessment data  (pre and post assessments for each unit).  Quantitative and qualitative data is accessible both online (Skedula and ATS provide  data to those with access), and in hared copy form.  All hard copy data is submitted and shared by either the administration or  the individual teachers.  Data is analyzed in grade team meetings, subject area meetings, and after school professional  developments.  Data anysis protocols are in place for reviewing student work and for grouping students by performance  levels.       2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          61         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The 2018 NYSESLAT, NYSITELL (for new arrivals), and ELA and Math State Tests are used to evaluate and inform our ELL  programs.  The ELL Data Analysis Tool is used to evaluate and visualize the NYSESLAT data, placing students in the appropriate  classes to ensure that they receive the proper number of minutes of service as per the CR Part 154 Regulations.  ELL  services are provided in the ELA classroom as well as in a Stand Alone setting depending on the NYSESLAT scores.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We use the ELL Data Analysis Tool to examine our ELL data and make adjustments to our programs.  The ENL teachers are  programmed flexibly each year based on the needs of the ever changing ELL population.  Stand Alone classes are bridged or  expanded based on these numbers.  The ELL service schedule is created in the first week of school by Mr. Ludwin, the ENL  Coordinator, based on the data from the NYSESLAT.  It is his responsibility to ensure that every student receives the  appropriate number of minutes of services based on their English language proficiency.    Mr. Ludwin uses various ATS reports to assist him with creating the ENL program.  He uses EDAT to program students for  integrated ENL services.  All integrated services are provided in the ELA general education classroom.  A template is used to  make the ENL schedule on excel, and then all of the programming is entered into Push in/Pull Out services on STARS  classroom.    The EDUR is a useful tool which is checked monthly to ensure that all ELLs are properly programmed into STARS  classroom.  Mr. Ludwin has also trained other ENL Coordinators in District 12 on how to use this system.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   In order to meet the mandates of CR part 154, as well as to provide quality instruction to our ENL students, we offer a  combination of both integrated and stand alone ENL services depending on students’ English proficiency levels.  All  ELL students are enrolled in general education ELA classes which are grouped heterogeneously and contain a mixture  of ELLs at all proficiency levels as well as non ELLs.  The ENL teacher provides co-teaching using a range of models  depending on the task (i.e. parallel teaching, small group instruction, re-teaching).  In addition, the ENL provider  creates scaffolds to support English learners access to the content.  Examples include the inclusion of visual aids, first  language translations, word banks, sentence starters and graphic organizers, to name a few.    The stand alone classes for entering and emerging students are classes based on English proficiency levels as  determined by the NYSESLAT.  In these classes, ELLs still access the common core standards for English Language Arts  using the sheltered instruction model.  SIOP aligned activities are used in the Stand Alone classroom, whereby  students gain important content knowledge through an amplification of materials using visuals and intensive  modeling and demonstration.  Students have opportunities to practice reading, writing, and speaking in English with  the benefits of a small group and more one on one interaction with the ENL teacher.  Topics are culturally relevant  and the home language is strategically used to promote English acquisition.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   We have three ENL certified teachers providing ENL services to our students, Mr. Ludwin, Mr. Herrera, and Ms. Ogbebor.  All of  our beginners, intermediates, and advanced students receive the appropriate number of mandated ENL minutes as per CR Part  154. These minutes are programmed into STARS Classroom by Mr. Ludwin, and he receives a monthly report called the EDUR  in order to ensure that all programming is accurate. This is particularly important because throughout the year, additional  students are arriving into the NYC DOE system, and updates are required.    We ensure that our commanding students are receiving a minimum of 90 minutes of ENL support by arranging for co-taught  classes for the first two years after they pass the NYSESLAT.  Entering students receive 8 units of ENL instruction through a  balanced mixture of 180 minutes of stand alone instruction and 180 minutes of ENL integrated instruction in either ELA or  another core content area.  Emerging students also receive 8 units of ENL instruction through a balanced mixture of 180  minutes of stand alone instruction and 180 minutes of ENL integrated instruction in either ELA or another core content  area.  Transitioning and Expanding students receive 4 units or 180 minutes of ENL integrated instruction in ELA or a content  area.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Our focus this year is to deliver content area instruction to allow multiple points of access to the content through text, visuals,  scaffolded supports, and talk.  Rather than providing modified content, we provide enhanced and amplified content.  The  school makes use of the NYS Bilingual Common Core Progressions as a reference to ensure that all ELLs are given access to the  same standards of learning as their native English speaking peers, with adjustments based on their proficiency  levels.  Although the school does not have a bilingual program, the New Language standards are applicable to ENL instruction,  and they provide examples of what an ELL should be able to do at each level of English language proficiency. These  progressions also help the ENL teachers to write their language objectives, because they provide language demands for each  standard.    Students will be exposed to concepts through multiple modalities in order to promote the development of both oral and  written language.  Students will be provided with explicit instruction in how to develop an argument to support their idea  using text evidence. This protocol will be repeated throughout the content areas to provide consistent strategies and repeated  practice. Additionally, students are seated heterogeneously during classroom instruction to facilitate discussion using peer  models.   Throughout the year we will provide professional development to all of our teachers so that in our content area  classrooms, ELLs will be provided with language supports such as sentence starters and the opportunity to have discussion  with direct teacher feedback in the moment. In addition to direct collaboration with content area teachers, our ESL teacher,  Mr. Ludwin will provide support in developing background knowledge through read-alouds, use of multimedia for content  explanation and pre-work to prepare for classroom discussions. Students will use native language supports such as texts in  their native language, connection of content area vocabulary to native language vocabulary, and conversations in native  language to prepare to discuss in English. Furthermore, we are expanding our use of integrated co-teaching in order to meet  the needs of our students acquiring academic language within the content areas.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   In order to appropriately evaluate all students in their native language, we will ensure that all state exams are ordered in  students' native language. We also assess all native Spanish speakers by using the Spanish LAB when they enroll. Additionally,  we allow students to complete tasks in their native language where appropriate.  We have also developed a rich multilingual  library, where students can be encouraged and excited to read salient texts in their native languages.  Their comprehension is  then assessed through book reviews and other activities in either that native language or in English.   Side by side texts in  multiple languages are also used to allow students to perform their own contrastive analysis of the native language with   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          63      English.    Mr. Herrera is also a native speaker of Spanish, which is the dominant home language of the English learners at the school. This  allows him to assess their progress regularly in the home language.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE students require significantly differentiated instruction. This can be done in either the delivery of the lessons, the  materials provided, or both. They benefit from texts geared towards their interests.  They also benefit from a scribe when  learning the alphabet for the first time.  SIFE differentiation strategies include: explicit review of the alphabet and phonetic  awareness, language somewhat simplified/ phrases repeated, providing explicit instructions and modeling, modeling think  alouds, multimedia presentations of content(picutes and video), hands on materials/Experiential learning vs. lecturing,  emphasizing vocabulary, semantic mapping (web diagrams or flow charts), graphic organizers, sentence starters / paragraph  frames, modeled writing and anchor charts, color coded sentences, providing outlines and summaries, tape recording sections  from the text, reducing the length of grade level text and examining language closely, and modifying assessments based on the  individual needs of the student.      b. Newcomer students require significantly differentiated instruction as well. This can be done in either the delivery of the  lessons, the materials provided, or both. They benefit from texts which are culturally relevant to them and their  experiences.  Newcomer differentiation strategies include: support with English grammar, language somewhat simplified/  phrases repeated, providing explicit instructions and modeling, modeling think alouds, multimedia presentations of content  (picutes and video), hands on materials/experiential learning vs. lecturing, emphasizing vocabulary, semantic mapping (web  diagrams or flow charts), graphic organizers, sentence starters / paragraph frames, modeled writing and anchor charts, tape  recording sections from the text, reducing the length of grade level text and examining language closely, allowing use of  home language, translations in native language, bilingual dictionaries in use, and modifying assessments based on the  individual needs of the student.      c. Developing students require somewhat differentiated instruction. This can be done in either the delivery of the lessons, the  materials provided, or both. Developing ELL differentiation strategies include: providing explicit instructions and modeling,  modeling think alouds, multimedia presentations of content(picutes and video), hands on materials/Experiential learning vs.  lecturing, graphic organizers, sentence starters / paragraph frames, modeled writing and anchor charts, providing outlines  and summaries, reducing the length of grade level text and examining language closely, and modifying assessments based on  the individual needs of the student.      d. Long Term ELL students require slightly differentiated instruction.  Differentiation strategies for Long Term  ELLs include: providing explicit instructions and modeling, modeling think alouds, hands on materials/Experiential learning vs.  lecturing, graphic organizers, sentence starters / paragraph frames, modeled writing and anchor charts, providing outlines  and summaries, reducing the length of grade level text and examining language closely.  These students are also assessed by  the SIT, and a plan is made to address the causes for long term ell status.  Many of these ELLs also have IEPs.  The goal of the  school is to incorporate specific Special Education strategies for such students in partnership with the SpEd Department.      e. Former ELL students receive two more years of ENL support for 90 minutes a week. Differentiation strategies for  Former ELLs include: providing explicit instructions and modeling, modeling think alouds, graphic organizers, modeled writing  and anchor charts, and providing outlines and summaries,     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          64      This year we will focus on developing protocols and aligning scheduling so that our teachers of ELL-SWDs can work closely with  the ENL provider as well as all providers to meet both the language acquisition needs and special needs of their students. The  following list of instructional strategies for teachers of ELL-SWD was designed by Mr. Ludwin. These strategies provide access  to content and accelerate English language development:    The MSTA teacher ensures/will provide...    o Language somewhat simplified/ phrases repeated  o Provides explicit instructions and modeling  o Objectives read aloud for content and language  o Activates Prior Knowledge (culturally relevant connections made)  o Models think aloud  o Multimedia presentation of content  o Visuals/diagrams/maps  o Realia (authentic materials from the real world)/ artifacts  o Videos  o Hands on materials/Experiential learning vs. lecturing  o Emphasizes Vocabulary  o Uses word walls  o Visuals support vocabulary  o Vocabulary is “frontloaded”  o Word banks  o Writing Scaffolds  o Brainstorming  § discussions before writing  § Semantic mapping (web diagrams or flow charts)  o Graphic organizers  o Sentence starters / paragraph frames  o Modeled writing and anchor charts  o Color coded sentences  o Modifies texts  o Provides outlines and summaries  o Rewrites or adapts the text  o Tape record sections from the text  o Adds visuals to the text  o Reduces the length of grade level text and examines language closely  o Allows use of home language  o Buddy system  o Translations in native language  o Bilingual Dictionaries in use  o Modifies assessments and assignments  o Oral assessments (one-on-one)  § Running record  o Student-made posters and presentations  o Reduces number of questions (choosing important concepts vs. detail)  o Uses word banks  o Designs individualized assessments  o Allows group work/buddy help     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          65      We regularly asses our ELL-SWDs to provide them with services in the least restrictive environment. ELL-SWDs are provided  with services as per their IEPs. Students are placed in a self contained class, ICT setting, or general education class with SETTS  based on the special education evaluation process and a collaborative effort with family, the guidance counsellor, and the  school based psychologist. All teachers review IEPs and IEP goals and modify curriculum and student goals accordingly. We also  provide flexible scheduling in all of our grades to allow students to receive services across the continuum in math and ELA.    The SIT has an ENL teacher, Mr. Ludwin, at every meeting to include the needs of these students.  Student work is analyzed,  IEPs are reviewed for quality and accuracy, and student action plans are created.  The SIT determines if each ELL is in the least  restrictive environment, and forms a plan to progress ELLs with IEPs into a less restrcitive setting over time as goals are  achieved.  ELLs in Special Education have flexible scheduling to ensure that they are integrated with their peers.  Some classes,  such as advisory, gym, and music, are less restrictive than core content subjects.  ELL students in self contained classes have  the flexibility to work with their general education peers in some such classes.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our goal is to provide interventions in Math and ELA through after school enrichment, Saturday Academy,  and AIS during the  school day. The subgroups that are targeted by these intervention programs are SIFE and newcomer ELLs. During after school  tutoring, these subgroups receive small group reading instruction that includes additional independent reading time, individual  comprehension conferences, and writing about reading using text evidence.    Throughout the day, SIFE and newcomer ELLs are targeted for AIS small group instruction in ELA and Math based on teacher  data. Saturday Academy is also focused on developing math and literacy skills in alignment with the Common Core State  Standards.  Saturday Academy has a course taught by a licensed ENL provider in order to deliver high quality, targeted  interventions for this subgroup of ELLs.  All ELLs are eligible based on test scores and teacher nomination. AIS and Saturday  Academy both use the Ready New York Curriculum for Math and ELA.    Some Former 8th grade ELLs receive after school enrichment for math, which includes use of reagents test preparation  materials and a routines bank of skills based problems of focus. Work for after school enrichment is selected based on student  assessments. All ELLs are eligible for this after school enrichment program based on test scores and teacher nomination.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?     This year we will have two foci for our ELLs: the improved development of academic vocabulary as well as increased  opportunities for writing.  Vocabulary will be promoted in all classes with word walls that are interactive and student driven, as  well as students centered, relevant vocabulary activities taught in context.  In addition, we have added an enrichment course  to our schedule for vocabulary development.  This class meets twice a week and focuses on the development of academic tier  III vocabulary words.  Writing will be developed and improved using more graphic organizers, sentence starters, and exemplar  writing models.  The literacy coach, Ms. Ogbonna, will support the ELA and ENL teachers with these best practices.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Due to low enrollment and parental request, the Transitional Bilingual Education program has been discontinued since the  2014-2015 school year.  Should enrollment and parental request patterns change, the school will open the program once  again.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All students, including ELLs, have access to attending our after school programs. Our after school program in partnership with  the Children’s Aid includes a wide range of athletic, artistic, and academic programs.  Notices for upcoming programs are  posted on our website, which is translatable into many languages.  All ELLs are able to take advantage of all grade level field  trips and opportunities. Our Title III program provides students an opportunity to develop skills in the four modalities.  Our Title III Program offers after school curriculum for ELLs on Wednesdays and Thursdays, and supports ELLs with test   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          66      preparation in the spring.         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We utilize new smartboards in all classrooms to provide frequent visuals, films and other multimedia representations of  content, as well as written models for students during instruction.  This gives ELLs frequent listening opportunities. The school  has revealed a brand new computer lab to encourage frequent incorporation of technology into instruction. Both i-Ready and  Performance Series computer based testing offer ELLs a stimulating, technology-based school experience. ELLs have  opportunities to do online research for several of their classes. ELLs are also enrolled in a computer class with the technology  teacher, Mr. Alfano, which exposes them to an introduction to programming as well as keyboard typing practice. All for  modalities of language are addressed by these programs.    Examples of text resources with enhanced visuals include graphic novels and non-fiction books which are rich in  illustrations.  Students use maps, graphs, charts, cycles, and models to support and amplify texts in the content areas.  They  are provided with hands on, tactile activities to support kinesthetic learners.  Total Physical Response strategies are also used  to develop language.  We also utilize iPads to provide language based centers and support development of literacy skills for  newcomers.    The ENL classroom has developed an extensive library of native language texts. The Spanish language library is well developed,  and additional texts in Bengali, French, and Chinese are slowly being incorporated. Students have access to bilingual  dictionaries in all of the first languages spoken, and content area teachers have been provided with bilingual content glossaries  in each home language.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We have bilingual dictionaries available for students in their native language in several content areas.  The ENL library also has  a robust offering of Spanish language novels and texts of interest for students to borrow and read either at home, or during  silent sustained reading.  All teachers are provided with content bilingual glossaries to use with students in their classrooms.  Additionally, ELLs have access to iPads, which provide a variety of options for providing instruction in native language.        Parents receive materials and information to support their child's progress in the language indicated on their home language  survey.       Translated standardized exams are ordered and administered whenever applicable (Math, 8th Grade Science).  Spanish  speaking students take the Spanish LAB when they are first admitted, and that data is shared with teachers so that they will  know the extend of the students' home language literacy.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All ELLs have equal access to appropriate services, supports, and resources.  The school utilizes grade appropriate standards  and curriculum in each content and grade band in order to ensure that all required services/ resources correspond to ELL  student age and grade levels.   The goal of the ENL Department is to modify and scaffold grade level, age appropriate materials  so that all ELLs have access and do not fall farther behind while they acquire English.    Mr. Ludwin ensures that every ELL is receiving the proper ENL services, and Dr. Shelton ensures that ELLs who are also SWD  receive those appropriate services as well. The SIT meets to ensure that appropriate services are being provided, and Mr.  Ludwin uses the monthly ELL data report to make sure the all ELL services are accurately entered on STARS classroom.    Grade level instruction and assessment is based on the NYS standards for learning in each subject area. The ELA Department  uses the Core Ready curriculum and the Math Department uses the Go Math curriculum. The Social Studies Department uses  Passport. All summative assessments are computer based, ensuring that materials are age and grade approriate.  The ENL department is overseen by Ms. Dotel, the assistant principal.  She meets weekly with Mr. Ludwin to discuss the  program and areas for growth, goals, etc.  When ENL teachers are observed, their feedback is shared with Mr. Ludwin by either  Mr. Njoku or Ms. Dotel, and he works with his team to address concerns and celebrate excellence.     2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          67         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The Principals of both our school and 211 have regular meetings to share their collaborative vision.  Mr. Ludwin meets with the  ENL teachers at 211 to share and exchange resources, such as DRA/ running records materials.  The Children's Aid program  supports ELLs from both schools as well, and we have campus activities to encourage teachers from both schools to share and  exchange resources and ideas.      Furthermore, the testing coordinators communicate, the Union reps communicate, and the parent coordinators communicate  to share resources and efforts to meet the needs of all ells in the shared building.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   All ELL students are invited to a meet and greet during the month of August for all new incoming students.  Here they are  provided an opportunity to meet teachers, administration and tour the school grounds.  This year, we will be hosting several  workshops for our ELL parents facilitated by our Assistant Principal, Ms. Suleika Dotel, our ENL teachers, Mr. Brad Ludwin, Mr  Herrera, and Ms. Ogbebor, and our Parent Coordinator Mr. Nathaniel Medina.  Furthermore, we collaborate with our  community based organization the Children’s Aid in order to plan campus wide events for our ELL students and parents.  In  addition, the school will direct parents to adult ENL classes, and hold cultural diversity celebrations.    Newly enrolled ELLs receive NYSITELL and Spanish LAB testing throughout the school year as they arrive. Home language  surveys, ELL welcome meetings, and parent selection forms are conducted and reviewed by Mr. Ludwin.    Mr. Medina meets with ELL parents regularly throughout the year to ensure that they receive all ELL related documents and  updates (i.e. entitlement letters, title III permission slips).  He aslo coordinates the newly enrolled ELLs' parent meeting with  Mr. Ludwin    Mr. Ludwin is the Chairperson for the SLT.  One role of the SLT is to determine activities for new ELLs and their families.  Such  activities include, but are not limited to, academic seminars conducted in Spanish for the families of newly enrolled ELLs,  Hispanic Heritage activities in September, and Cultural Celebration activities in April.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    ELLs in the 6th and 7th grade receive Spanish language classes to further develop their meta-linguistic awareness and move  students towards multilingualism.  In addition, this course provides all students with a window into the language learning  process.  8th grade students who demonstrate excellence in Spanish are permitted to take the Spanish LOTE in advance of high  school.  This allows MSTA ells to be ahead of their peers in the 9th grade.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not Applicable        2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          68      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Effective educators are constantly re-evaluating and rethinking their practices focusing on curriculum requirements, new  information and research, and the day-to-day demands of teaching. It is our belief that in order to make the best teaching  decisions for our students, we must be fully informed about credible research, exemplary teaching practices, the social aspects  of learning, how our students develop as learners, etc. One of the best ways to continue to be knowledgeable is through  engagement in ongoing professional learning and conversations during grade level meetings/planning days, weekly Monday  professional learning,  periodic professional development days, professional reading, and through the turn-keying of  information acquired while attending workshops and seminars outside of the school.  All of the faculty at our school (Principal,  Assistant Principal, teachers, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, special educators, speech therapist, psychologist,  secretaries and parent coordinator) are required to attend all ELL Professional Learning sessions since as a community we are  all teachers of English Language Learners.  For members who are unable to attend these sessions, information is turn keyed by  either the Assistant Principal, Ms. Dotel or our ENL teacher, Mr. Ludwin.  Additionally, Mr. Ludwin provides at least two PDs a  year to the general education teachers specific to the needs of ELLs.  This year, those PDs will focus on academic vocabulary  and evaluating ELL writing.       Mr. Ludwin, our ENL teacher and ELL Liaison, will receive multiple Professional Development Opportunities through the Office  of ELLs as well as other professional organizations. Mr. Ludwin will attend ELA department meetings in order to provide  colleagues with support in developing units, tasks, and lessons that provide supports for ELLs and appropriate resources. This  structure also allows Mr. Ludwin to infuse the Common Core Standards into his curricular planning. The hope is that this  infusion offered our students a smoother transition between ENL and ELA through common language and common curriculum  used.  Both teachers will works in close collaboration with the staff to support student transition to Middle School by attending  weekly common planning time meetings with staff as needed.    Professional Development topics for all teachers of ELLs this year include (to be conducted on Mondays after school):     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All professional development activities take place after school on Mondays.  For these meetings, there is an agenda with a sign  in sheet.  These documents are saved in a binder kept with the assistant principal.  The materials shared at the pd are sent out  to all teachers digitally.  In order to ensure that all teachers receive 15% of total hours of PD focused on ELL related topics, the  following will take place this year:    In order to ensure that Mr. Ludwin and Ms. Ogbebor achieve 50% of their PD in ELL related topics, they will attend monthly  trainings outside of the building focused around ELLs in addition to what is offered at the school.  As the ELL Liaison, Mr.  Ludwin attends training led by the district, and then turnkeys the information to Ms. Ogbebor.  All materials and documents  are stored in a binder in the ENL classroom.              2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          69      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Mr. Ludwin and Ms. Ogbebor conduct mandatory one to one meetings with the parents of all ELLs to inform parents of their  child's prgress.  In this meeting, parents receive a detailed breakdown of their child's NYSESLAT results by modality and form  goals for the upcoming school year.  Records of these meetings are kept using a log, and these records are stored in the ENL  classroom.    Parent Workshops surrounding important issues in the academic community such as changes to CR Part 154, getting ready for  the state tests, and other topics will also be provided by the school or through our partnership with The Children's Aid.    Mr. Medina, the Language Access Coordinator, ensures that the appropriate translation services are available to parents for all  meetings.  The phone service is regularly employed.  Resources and materials are translated in English and the parents home  language by either a school faculty member or the NYCDOE Translation department.  We also ensure that at least one member  of the the school leadership team is the parent of an ELL so that they can contribute and have a voice in the decisions made by  that committee.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   MSTA provides many offerings to the parents of ELLs to make them feel both welcome and involved in the school  community.   For example, adult ENL courses are offered for those wishing to further their own English skills.  ELL parents are  active members of the School Leadership Team. This year's SLT parent events include the following:    Teachers are encouraged to devise homework assignments that are accessible to parents who speak languages other than  English and promote parent engagement.  ELL parents are invited for writing celebrations and publishing parties of student  work.  MSTA also benefits from a very active Parent Association, and provides frequent communication about students’  academic progress.   MSTA will send home report cards and/or progress reports 6 times throughout the school year – all of  which are signed for and returned.  Families in need of translated materials fill out an additional survey and their needs are  met via phone call and/or translated materials sent home.    We also have a website, where near-weekly communication is sent home via phone blast and will be able to be translated on  the webpage. Students’ grades, attendance, and assessments are also able to be viewed online through system called Pupil  Path.             Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Uchechukwu Njoku, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          71                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   School of Mathematics, Science                                                                              School DBN: 12X318  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
