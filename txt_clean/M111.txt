This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Our mission is for each school constituency to work cooperatively to create a positive learning environment for all  students. Our community works diligently to teach the whole child so that he/she develops a strong sense of self, an  ability to work within any community, and the critical thinking skills that are required to make good choices in the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      academic and non-academic world. Each child at PS 111 will be taught to his or her individual needs, so that maximum  academic achievement is attained.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS/IS 111 Adolph S. Ochs is an elementary school with 420 students in grades PK-5. The school population is  comprised of 13% Black, 45% Hispanic, 20% White, 17% Asian students, and 5% "other" or "multiple"..    PS/IS 111 is comprised of a linguistically, ethnically, racially, religiously, economically, and educationally diverse  student body, a highly skilled and committed teaching staff, and caring parents.   PS/IS 111 has partnered with the following community-based organizations: Orchestra of St. Luke’s; Police Athletic  League (PAL); Kids in the Game (KING); Marquis Studios; Hartly House, Inc.; Workplace Mentoring Program; PENCIL  Organization; NY Cares; Alvin Ailey; BookPals/PencilPals; Center for the Arts Education; Spoons Across America;  Random House; Impact Chess;    Our staff is working to build a community of independent learners among all students in all grades, and building  student independence is one of the school's core goals. Two specific pedagogical strategies we are using to do this are  1. Building discussion skills and 2. Working with students to accurately self-assess and peer-assess. To build  discussion, we have been employing “Socratic Seminar” and "Number Talks". Both involve explicit instruction to help  students engage in independent discussions – without the need for teacher mediation of conversations. Students are  required to come to conversations prepared with the facts, data, and information they will need to fully participate.  “Number Talks” is a math program that builds students’ mental math abilities, improves students’ number sense, and  also develops conversation skills as students need to be able to explain their math thinking and evaluate the math  explanations provided by their classmates.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The student body includes 10% English Language Learners and 21% Special Education students. Our students with IEPs  perform below school average. Our ENL population also performs below the school average, but showed significant  movement toward proficiency this year. Approximate 20% of our student population lives in temporary housing.  Many of those students have attended multiple schools prior to enrolling in our school, and a goal is to make them  feel secure and welcome in a new environment.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Collaborative teaching will continue to be an area of focus for 2018-2019. During this school year, we will expand our  lesson studies, so that each grade team will participate in at least round of lesson study. Using the lesson study format  in schools has been shown to increase teacher collaboration, competency, and increase student achievement.  "Inter- visitations" with also remain a strategy used to building collaboration and professional trust among the teaching staff.  We saw improvements in continuity across classrooms in a grade, and vertically through the grades. We attribute  much of this to consistent professional development in math and literacy.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 02M111   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   395   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Feedback from the Superintendent and staff developers continues to indicate that improvements can be made in  creating common practices concerning differentiation, as well as unified curriculum. Indicator 2.2 (Assessment) from  the 2016-2017 QR indicated that assessment practices vary across the school. Additionally, reviews of classroom  practice by school administrators, and district personnel, have indicated the need for improved use of rubrics and  "learning progressions" by teachers, administrators, and students. Improved use of rubrics and progressions, including  teacher agreement on scoring using these tools, will help lead to refined differentiation practices, and assessment  practices. Assessment data from school created assessments and state standardized assessments show that there are  still at least half of students performing below grade level, but that progress is made each quarter (and yearly) by  students.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   The majority of students performing below grade level standards in reading, writing, and mathematics will make  improvements by June 2019. Specifically, 75% of students performing at level 1 in each area, as measured by the state  assessments, common core aligned rubrics, and school created assessments, will improve at least one level - to level 2  or level 3, and 50% of students performing at level 2 will improve at least one level - to levels 3 or 4.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the  activities and strategies your school will  implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element,  including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be targeted?

Strategies to address the needs of  students with disabilities, English  language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g.,  overage/under-credited, SIFE, STH).   Professional development will be provided  for teachers during mandated Monday  afternoon PD time. There will be a specific  focus in grades K-5 on the implementation of  the new reading and writing curricula  (TCRWP). Use of the writing and reading  "pathways" will be an integral component to  ensure that teachers are assessing students  in a cohesive manner.   Common planning time will be provided for  ICT, SETSS, and ESL providers to meet with  General Education teachers to discuss and  implement best practices for differentiating  instruction to meet the benchmarks set in  the CCLS aligned rubrics. Staff members will  collaborate on how best to address the  needs of students with special needs and  English Language Learners by creating an  entry point for comprehension of rubrics  across all grade levels. Vocabulary  instruction will also be a focal point for  meeting the needs of these students.   Teachers will have consistent contact with  parents about the expectations and goals of  the classroom. They will distribute monthly  letters to parents including the current unit  of study, and access to the rubric being used  to measure student progress. These  expectations and rubrics being used to  measure them will be reinforced during  three annual parent teacher conferences.

Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement  planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal.  Teachers will administer benchmark assessments in reading, writing, and mathematics three times per year  (approximately September, February, and May/June). Data will be analyzed after each assessment, with particular  focus on the growth from September to February, and again from February to June. The February benchmark  assessments will be used as a mid-point measurement in which we will look for the percentage of students making  progress toward moving from level 1 to level 2, or level 2 to level 3. All teachers in a grade are using the same  benchmark assessment, and all teachers will use that assessment for each benchmark in order to have a consistent  measure.     Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January  Regents, etc.)  Identical beginning of year, middle of year, and end of year teacher created assessments in literacy and math will be  scored by teachers. Progress will be determined by comparing BOY and EOY data. State assessment data will be used  to measure growth for students in 4th and 5tth grades.     Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action  plan, if applicable.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14      Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans     Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and  school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Our attendance data shows that we are below average for similar schools. We believe that we can further improve  our use of developmentally appropriate strategies for assisting in improving student behaviors even further. Our  intention is that when all staff are utilizing "developmentally appropriate" strategies then this will affect both  attendance and behavior. OORS data indicates that the vast majority of school behavior incidents occur at lunch and  recess. The majority of students in our school with low attendance, and behavior concerns, are students with  inconsistent housing, inconsistent family life, and/or inconsistent educational experiences (i.e. moving school to  school). For these students, consistency and caring approaches are especially needed. To support this work, we are  utilizing feelings charts, mood meter, and mindful breathing activities.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   The most recent Framework report indicates that teachers are looking for more professional guidance from  administration; specifically around a unified and rigorous curriculum. The report indicates that teachers trust their  colleagues, and administration, as well as believe that they receive professional feedback and support. There is room  for improvement for teachers feeling supported in a professional manner and in improving the quality of professional  development that improves instruction in the classroom.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, at least 75% teachers will indicate satisfaction with the feedback and support provided by the  administration for observations, and general development. A Likert Scale survey will be used to measure this in June  2019.   The principal and assistant principal will engage in a new method of observations, which the teachers have already  indicated seems like a positive move for them. Teacher observation cycles will be conducted quickly, over the course of  four or five weeks, with five to eight instructional days between each observation. The teacher and administration will  decide on an instructional goal prior to the first observation, or during the debrief of the first observation. These  observations will be supported by periodic visits to the classrooms throughout the year. The goal is to provide  immediate feedback, followed by a quick succession to support the implementation of that feedback.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          21   Target Group(s)  Who will be targeted?

Science and Social Studies teachers use classroom based  assessments.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33        A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S 111, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 111M will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Students will be subgrouped by age (with others of the same grade or one year  difference) as well as by language proficiency level.  NYSESLAT data reveals that writing is the  weakest skill for most of the students. Therefore, students who attend our program this year will  participate in an intensive thematic study on the theme of Favorite Characters with a focus on  building writing skills by both writing about characters in books they read, and also by creating  their own stories with interesting characters they invent. In order to ensure that all students  receive appropriate instruction for their grade and language level, we will employ parallel and  small group teaching.  We will have three teachers working in tandem, so that each student's  instruction is targeted and age appropriate.  Although the primary skill targeted will be writing,  basic reading instruction through direct phonics lessons, vocabulary development practice, and  shared reading for comprehension will be reinforced as well.  Students will study models for  writing, and engage in shared and interactive writing about their favorite characters based on age  and level appropriate books on the theme of Favorite Characters. Through their study of the topic  of Favorite Characters, ELLs will learn important new content and skills.        Based on the 2018 NYSESLAT  and NYSITELL results, our program will be subgrouped as laid  out below:   For the entering and emerging students we will scaffold instruction as follows: students will be  grouped by grade [one group of second and third grade entering and emerging newcomers (5  students) and one group of fourth and fifth grade entering and emerging newcomers (4  students)].  For thirty minutes each student will have the opportunity to use "Imagine Learning",  an adaptive research-based computer program designed to teach language and literacy skills  to ELLs utilizing native language support while the other group of students develop their basic  language and literacy skills by participating with a teacher in shared reading, guided listening,  and interactive writing. Then the groups will switch stations.  The small size of the groups will  allow for abundant practice of all language skills for each student, as well as language  development through a research-based language/literacy learning tool.   (This subgroup will  serve 9 newcomer ELLs and be taught by fully certified ENL teacher, Elizabeth Hannigan.)  For the transitioning and expanding students we will scaffold instruction as follows: students will  be grouped into two subgroups by grade and area of greatest need as  per NYSESLAT results.  For thirty minutes the students will work on an appropriate group text  with a teacher. For one small group (9 advanced long term third and fourth grade ELLs for  whom NYSESLAT showed writing as the major area of need), a teacher will introduce a writing  exemplar that highlights writing skills, such as sentence expansion and adding actions to one's  writing to "show not tell" a story.   Lexical sets such as descriptive adjectives and synonyms for  "said" will be taught explicitly as well.  For the other small group (6 advanced newcomer second  and third grade students for whom NYSESLAT showed reading as the major area of need), a  teacher will help the students develop their higher level reading skills, such as inferring and  drawing conclusions about character changes and motivations, by participating with a teacher in  small group guided and strategy lessons.  These subgroups will subsequently switch teachers,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   and each group will work with their new teacher to co-construct a story employing all they know  about writing and character development.  This system of highly thoughtful grouping will allow  each student to receive targeted supplemental support through direct teacher instruction and  interaction.  The final twenty minutes each day will be an opportunity for the students to share  their work of the day with students from the other subgroup.  This will build a sense of  community among the ENL students as well as providing an opportunity for repeated practice of  speaking, reading and listening skills.  (This subgroup will serve 15 newcomer and long term  ELLs and the teaching will be shared equally by fully certified ENL teacher, Jennifer Singer, and  general education certified teacher, Niamh NiDhiomasaigh.)  Sets of fiction books with complex and entertaining characters that reflect the lives, families, and  interests of our ELL students will be purchased through Title III.  The website "Learning A-Z",  which has built-in supports for ELLs such as picture cards, will be utilized as a source of leveled  reading texts as well.  Ink will be purchased through Title III in order to print student copies of  the books, graphic organizers, and vocabulary cards available on the "Learning A-Z"  website.  Laptops and subscriptions for "Imagine Learning" and "Learning A-Z"  were purchased  through another funding source.  However, we will purchase headphones through Title III, so  students are able to use the computers without disrupting others. The program will begin on  December 5th and end on March 28th.  It will meet every Wednesday and Thursday from 2:40- 4:10 barring school holidays for a total of 28 one and a half hour sessions.    In total, 126 hours  of direct instruction will occur at a total cost of $7,641.90 to Title III.  All instruction will be in  English. However, "Learning A-Z" supplies Spanish language supports and "Imagine Learning"  supplies native language supports in all the languages spoken by the ELLs who will attend the  program.   All instructional materials will be purchased using Title III funds for a cost of  $2,358.75.   Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:                 Our teachers will engage in a book study/study group.  As we have identified writing as an  area with which many of our ELLs are struggling, both on NYSESLAT and in their classroom  work, we will focus on best practices for the teaching of writing to ELLs. To keep the study very  targeted we will focus primarily on the genre of fiction.  Scaffolding Language, Scaffolding Learning, by Pauline Gibbons , and Common Core for the  Not-So-Common Learner, by Maria G. Dove and Andrea Honigsfeld, have been chosen as the  core of this professional learning.  Each of these texts offers one, or more, pieces that are integral  to our teachers' continued growth.         Professional development (book study) will take place on November 7th, 8th, 28th and 29th  from 2:40-4:10.  On 11/7 the topic will be Derewianka's Curriculum Cycle using Chapter 4  of  Scaffolding Language, Scaffolding Learning as a guiding text ("Writing in a Second Language  Across the Curriculum: An Integrated Approach").  On 11/8 the topic will be Scaffolding writing  by building background using Chapter 7 of Scaffolding Language, Scaffolding Learning as a  guiding text ("Learning Language, Learning Through Language, and Learning About Language:  Developing an Integrated Curriculum").  On 11/28 the topic will be Explicit teaching of writing  strategies using chapter 6 of Common Core for the Not-So-Common Learner as a guiding text   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44         Part C: Professional Development   ("Writing Strategies").   On 11/29 the topic will be Scaffolding writing through academic  language development and rehearsal using chapter 2 of Common Core for the Not-So-Common- Learner as a guiding text ("Strategies for Academic Language Development").    All teachers who will be teaching in the Title III program will be mandated to attend this study  group and paid for their time at a total cost to Title III of $1,091.70. General education teachers  with ELLs in their classrooms will be invited to attend, but will not be paid for their  participation.  We already own multiple copies of each of our book study texts, so there will be  no supply costs to Title III.   There will not be any provider for this study group.  Instead of  having a provider, the participants will follow the "Four A's Text Group Study Protocol".   Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as  parent orientation during ELL identification process.     rationale       schedule and duration      name of provider    how parents will be notified of these activities   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             P.S. 111 will engage our parents in a family workshop, plus a series of ESL instruction/classes.  The family workshop will be for parents of all ELLs highlighting ways to keep the students'  learning and language acquisition developing over the summer.  The rationale for this workshop  is data showing a significant backwards slide in the ELL student performance from June to  September.  Summer program options in the schools and throughout the borough will be  explained and practice materials will be presented and distributed.  Teachers will provide parents  with suggestions of cultural institutions which families can visit, articles to read in their native  language, and vocabulary lists for parents to practice at home with their children. This workshop  will be presented by fully certified ENL teachers, Jennifer Singer and Elizabeth Hannigan, on  Tuesday, April 9th from 2:40-4:00 at no cost to Title III . The parents will be notified by letters  in their preferred languages distributed by the ENL teachers.  Parents who attend will sign in and  receive an agenda, both of which will be kept in the ENL compliance binder.        Our parent engagement funds will be used to pay a teacher to teach parents English.   On  curriculum night and during ELL parent orientation meetings we surveyed parents about their  needs and many wanted a class to learn English.  Therefore, we opted to commit our funds in this  way.  The parent classes will be offered every Wednesday from 1:00 to 2:30p.m beginning on  Wednesday, December 5, 2018 and continuing every week barring school holidays through  March  27th, 2019 for a total of 14 sessions (21 direct instruction hours) at a cost of $1,273.65 to  Title III.  The topics to be covered will include functional English such as "how to fill out  applications", "how to describe health issues", and "meeting new people", as well as basic  English vocabulary and grammar development.  The learning materials for the parents were  purchased last year and therefore will be of no cost to Title III. The teacher of the parent class is,  Maria Gagnay, a fully certified ENL teacher.  Ms. Gagnay will take  attendance at every class  session which will be placed right after class in the mailbox of our ENL teacher, Ms. Singer, who  will keep it in the school's ENL compliance binder.  Our parent coordinator, Zaida Cosme, will  send written invitations to the parents of all ELLs in the school in parents' preferred languages  based on their HLIS.  Additionally, multi-language flyers will be posted in the lobby of the  school.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    We have identified these two focal points as important concerns, and they fit in with city  initiatives.  While instructing students and helping them to acquire the English language is  critical, it is also important to help students maintain their native language.   People at home and  in school should work together to ensure both languages are mastered.  The parent textbooks are  already owned by the school and the summer practice materials will be made by the ENL  teachers.  Therefore, the only cost to Title III for parent engagement will be the $1,273.65 in per  session for the teacher of the parent English class.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school utilizes the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) and the Fountas & Pinnell (F&P) reading levels  to assess the early literacy skills of all our students including our second language learners. Running records are administered  by teachers throughout the school year to get more information about how a child is reading.  These running records are  extremely important in helping the ENL and common branch teachers to target a student's needs in reading and language.  If  ELLs are leaving off the third person S in their reading, for example, then a strategy lesson in reading through the whole word  would be appropriate, as well as a grammar lesson on when we use the third person S.     Spelling and phonics levels are measured by the Words Their Way spelling inventory and with Wilson  Fundations assessments.  Students are leveled from “beginning consonants” to “inflected endings” and grouped for instruction  accordingly.  This allows spelling instruction to be aimed just right, rather than assuming a whole class needs to study the same  words or spelling patterns.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         “Writing on Demand” pieces are also given periodically throughout the school year. These writing pieces assess students'  independent writing abilities and inform instructional decisions.  They also measure growth in writing conventions,  elaboration, grammar, sequence, and other general writing skills.  For students still in the initial stages of language acquisition,  modified writing assignments and assessments are provided, such as "label this picture" or draw the beginning, middle, and  end of a story.              2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teachers are periodically provided coverage in order to analyze test data meaningfully, so as to properly target instruction and  effectively group students for small group work.  This work is done in grade teams which include the classroom teachers as  well as the ENL and special ed service providers whenever possible.    The school has also begun using one drive on outlook in order to facilitate communication among administration, classroom  teachers and service providers with regards to student needs.  As a TC school,  all teachers are provided checklists with each reading and writing unit to help students assess their own  reading and writing habits and techniques in order to set tangible goals for improvement.  These goals are usually short term  attainable goals agreed upon by the student and teacher and grounded firmly in the curriculum.  Additionally, the school has  two staff developers from TC who come in to work with staff on implementing quality instruction.  The assistant principal has fostered relationships with many institutions of higher learning in order to insure a steady flow of  student teachers to the school.  This has proved invaluable in Terms of allowing for more frequent small group instruction  based on student need.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The NYSITELL is administered to any non-English speaking or bilingual student new to the NYC public school system is used to  identify students’ strengths or weaknesses in the four language modalities:  listening, speaking, reading, and writing and  determines whether a child is commanding, expanding, transitioning, emerging, or entering.  In addition, native Spanish  speakers who score below commanding on the NYSITELL are administered the Spanish LAB to measure native language fluency  and literacy skills. SLAB results help us see whether students are having ENL issues or whether their issues may be more overall  academic issues or environmental ones.    Every spring ELLs are administered the NYSESLAT exam and students are scored as commanding, expanding, transitioning,  emerging, or entering.  NYSESLAT data is reported in terms of student skills in  listening, reading, writing, and speaking, and the  data is used to determine teaching focus as well as mandated service hours.  These results also help us measure students'  growth or lack of growth across the years which allows us to see the efficacy of our ENL program overall and for particular  students.      In addition to the NYSESLAT, the state ELA and math exams are the standardized assessments that are used to evaluate the  efficacy of the ENL program by measuring ENL students’ growth over the course of years as it compares to the rest of the  school population. We also use the EDAT to determine risk factors for individual students, so we can be sure to have additional  supports in place where needed.  This tool helps to highlight overarching areas of strength in our program as well as areas in  need of improvement.     To measure growth over the course of a single school year other criterion based assessments in decoding, vocabulary, spelling,  reading, and fiction and informational genre writing are used, some created by grade groups and others by TCRWP.  The ENL  teachers take into account the progress of individual English language learners as well as the group as a whole to determine  which instructional strategies are working and what content needs to be reviewed in a different way.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      IEP modifications applied for standardized testing are used in the administration of all assessments which come with the  curricula, as well as all teacher-made assessments.   Whenever possible, math and other content assessments are provided in  the students' native language.              4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    First of all, the administration organizes the staff and scheduling of assessments to insure that support staff is available to aid  in the testing efforts.  This insures that all students with modifications, including ELLS, are tested in the correct way.  They  also provide bilingual glossaries, translated tests or oral translators when appropriate. All benchmark assessments given to  other students are given to the ELLs with the mandated ELL modifications.  The only exception to this is that although first year  ELLS are exempt from taking the ELA, we do have some of our first year ELLS participate in ELA benchmark assessments when  the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher agree that a particular student has sufficient English skills such that the assessment  will yield useful data.  The administration uses data from summative assessments to set the professional development goals for the school      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Data is used to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI)  framework to differentiate the needs of  ELLs at the various proficiency levels.   Student growth in the 4 modalities is used to guide instruction based on identified  needs either on the Listening/Speaking strands or the Reading/Writing continuum based on studying the EDAT and  NYSESLAT scores. Additionally, baseline universal assessments are given in math and the results help to determine which  students may need more intensive and tailored instruction.  This instruction is provided by the ENL teachers during integrated  ENL instruction, by the classroom teachers during independent reading, and/or by SETTS teachers providing at-risk  support.  Rti activities for ELLs include, but are not limited to: using math manipulatives, previewing texts that will be read in  class and frontloading difficult and/or useful vocabulary from the text, short problem solving activities which require  conversation and critical thinking skills, and co-writing of texts to serve as a model for independent work.  Progress is regularly  monitored using running records and on-demand writing and paraphrasing assessments.  ELLs who do not show improvement  in a reasonable amount of time are referred to the Academic Intervention Team for further support.     Additionally, in the Go Math Curricula for grades 3-5, there are RtI manuals that provide targeted practice in specific sub-skills  which correspond directly to the Go Math assessments.  This has been an invaluable resource for providing extra instruction  and practice in small groups during the school day and in the Title III after school program.           6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Kindergarten NYSITELL scores reveal that the majority of our kindergarten ELLs are advanced (3 transitioning, 5 expanding,  ).  There are only 2 kindergarten ELLs at the entering level and none at the emerging level.  As all these students have just  begun their academic career here, there is no comparison data available for them at this time.     Of the 8 first graders who scored at the beginning or intermediate levels on the NYSITELL in kindergarten, 5 went up at least a  level, 1 was not here during the NYSESLAT window last year and therefore does not have a current score that is valid, 1 came  very late in kindergarten and therefore took the NYSESLAT shortly after taking the NYSITELL, and 1 does not talk to adults and  therefore has a speaking score of 2 which brought his whole score down.  Three of the first graders who scored advanced on  the NYSITELL in kindergarten, scored expanding on the NYSESLAT and one scored transitioning.  Although it is difficult to  compare “Advanced” grades to “transitioning” and “expanding” grades, there appears to be no or little growth for these  higher level ELLs.      Of the 6 second grade ELLs, 2 are new to the school/country.  Of the 4 students who were here last year, 3 have IEPs for ICT as  well as related services.  In some cases, learning issues likely impacted the academic development as well as the test scores of  these students.  One student went from the intermediate to the expanding level. One went from the intermediate to the  transitioning level.  The third went down from the intermediate to the emerging level.  One second grader was advanced in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         kindergarten and became proficient in first and now is in her last year of receiving ELL support.     In third grade, two ELLs are new to the school/country. Two ELLs have gone up from true beginners in second grade to  intermediate/emerging this year.  One ELL went up from intermediate to commanding.  One ELL was advanced for two years  and then went to expanding this year.  She is currently being evaluated for a reading/writing disability as these are the areas in  which she is not showing growth.     In fourth grade, 1 student went from advanced to commanding, 2 students went from intermediate to transitioning, one went  from advanced to expanding, representing no or negative growth, 1 went from advanced to emerging, representing negative  growth, and one went from beginner to entering showing no growth. One student went from advanced in second grade to  proficient in third and is now in his last year of receiving ELL support.     In fifth grade, one student is new to the school/country, one student went from intermediate to expanding, one student went  from advanced to expanding, one student went from advanced to commanding, one student has stayed at low  intermediate/emerging for three years.  He has an IEP for ICT, multiple related services and has been recommended for 12-1- 1. Three students went from advanced in third grade to proficient in fourth grade, and are now in their last year of receiving  ELL support.               7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   ELL teachers, and administrators, present data to staff several times per year.  Data analysis meetings are held periodically to  determine a course of action.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   ELL and former ELL students are placed in one general education classroom on a grade whenever possible to facilitate  scheduling of ENL services.  If the student is mandated for ICT or G&T, he or she is placed in the required setting.  All  classes in this school at this time are monolingual English.  The whole class travels together as a group to all specials  and to lunch.  All classes in this school are single grade except for one Gifted and Talented class which is a 3/4  bridge.  In the case of the bridge class, the fourth graders are pulled out as a group for math instruction with a fully  certified math teacher while the third graders stay in their classroom for math instruction with their teacher.  All  classes in this school are heterogeneous in terms of proficiency levels, however small group instruction is provided  throughout the day at which times, students are often grouped homogeneously by their academic needs.  All students  in the Gifted and Talented classes must pass the G&T test; however, this does not create classes that are  homogeneous.  There is wide variation in levels among the students in the G&T as well as in the general education  and ICT classrooms.  Third, Fourth, and Fifth grade classes travel as a group to science where they are taught grade  level science by a science teacher.  Fourth and Fifth grade classes are further departmentalized.   ELA and Social  Studies are taught by fully certified common branch teachers, and math by fully certified math teachers.  All other  grades (pre-k - 3) are taught all academic subjects by their common branch teachers.  ELL students at the entering and emerging levels are pulled out for standalone ENL class for 45 minutes four times a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         week to get targeted instruction in English.  There are 3 pullout ENL groups (grades K-1, grades 2-3, and grades 4- 5).  While the proficiency levels are mixed, all the students in the pullout group have many of the same needs and  instruction is differentiated to ensure that all students are moving forward in their English studies.  Lessons  incorporate all four modalities, listening, speaking, reading, and writing.  A new lexical set is studied each week as well  and practiced until it is mastered.   All pullout groups include students from only one or two contiguous grades.  These  students also receive four 45 minute sessions of integrated ENL in their own classrooms in which the ENL teacher  works with them on the core curriculum in a modified form.  Even when the ENL teacher is not in their classroom, the  content area/common branch teachers are expected to have scaffolds in place (through planning with the ENL  teacher and grade planning sessions) so their ELLs have age-appropriate and challenging work to do in the  classroom.  Whenever available native language materials are provided to help the ELLs with content  comprehension.  Google translate is also used to translate relevant documents that are not available in a student's  language.  Additionally, the "Imagine Learning" program is purchased through Title III each year as targeted  intervention with native language supports that entering (sometimes emerging) students use for thirty minutes a day  in their classroom.   Students at the transitioning and expanding levels receive all their ENL support in their classroom.  The ENL teacher  works closely with the common branch teachers to create appropriate scaffolds to make sure the class content is  comprehensible to the ELLs.  In addition to coplanning, the ENL teacher is in the general education classroom four 45  minute periods a week assisting with small group instruction of the target material.   The ENL teacher attends the  common planning grade meeting for all the grades that she teaches to help teachers create appropriate scaffolds to  bolster the comprehension of the ELLs in their classes. As with less advanced ELLs, native language materials are  provided whenever possible to help the ELLs with content comprehension.  We are always actively looking for ways to  provide more native language support. Currently, Ms. Singer, one fully-certified  ESL teacher, pushes in to one general  education third grade and one G&T third grade, one ICT fourth grade and one gen ed fourth grade, and one general  education fifth grade.  Our other fully certified ENL teacher, Elizabeth Hannigan, pushes in to one general ed  Kindergarten, one ICT kindergarten, one ICT first grade and one G&T first grade, and one ICT second grade.     b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Explicit ENL instructional minutes are delivered according to the new mandates in grades 2,3,4,and 5 by Ms. Singer, a fully  certified ENL teacher.  More specifically, all the entering and emerging ELLs in grades two and three are pulled out together for  one unit of standalone ENL per week by Ms. Singer. The same is true for all the entering and emerging ELLs in grades four and  five. Additionally, Ms. Singer pushes into all the third, fourth, and fifth grade classrooms to provide integrated ENL.  She is  scheduled for 4 periods a week in the classrooms with entering, emerging, transitioning and or expanding ELLs.  She is  scheduled 2 periods a week in the classrooms which contain former ELLs, but no current ELLs. Additionally, she is scheduled to  attend all grade meetings for the grades she services.  Explicit ENL instructional minutes are delivered according to the new  mandates in grades K,1,and 2 by Ms. Hannigan, a fully certified ENL teacher.  More specifically, she is scheduled for 1 unit per  week of standalone ENL instruction with all the entering and emerging ELLs in grades one and two. She is scheduled to push  into the ICT and general education kindergartens for one unit of integrated ENL services each, and one unit each of integrated  ENL in the ICT, G&T, and general ed first grades, and one unit of integrated ENL in the second grade ICT.     The ENL team along with the administration carefully looks over the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT results and uses them to  determine a schedule for the ENL teachers that covers the mandated instructional minutes.  Coplanning among the ENL  teachers and the ELA and math instructors aids in making sure the ELA and Math content is comprehensible to ELLs. Also, the  presence of ENL teachers in the classrooms during ELA instruction allows for work in small groups giving the ELLs more   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      opportunity to work directly with a teacher to understand and practice new content.  HLA instruction is not provided at this  school, however, whenever possible translated versions of key texts and assignments are provided.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In Standalone ENL, content is presented at the students' current levels and a little above (input is i+1).  Shared learning  activities are the basis of reading and writing instruction. In the younger grades repeated readings of big books are used to  teach features of literature and basic reading strategies as well as vocabulary.   With older students, multiple copies of high  interest, lower-level books are supplied to the students and used as the basis for shared reading lessons. In all grades word  study poems and chants are used to teach word families and other phonetic skills. Explicit listening activities are  commonplace, such as listening to a song to hear which colors the singer is singing about or listening to clues to determine  which picture the teacher is describing.  The silent period is respected in the ENL classroom, however, speaking activities are  modelled and practiced. Turn and talk partnerships are utilized after the teacher provides a spoken model of appropriate  answers and a written speaking prompt. Development of skills in all four modalities are assessed regularly.  Reading skills are  assessed through running records and sight word assessment lists.  Writing skills are assessed through periodic dictations and  picture description writing.  Listening skills are assessed through listening activities that come from Authentic Assessment for  ELLs or Spotlight English.  Speaking is informally assessed throughout class, and formally assessed through transcripts of  students' retells about books.    In integrated ENL, grade level content is presented in alternate ways to make it more comprehensible to ELLs.  These ways  may include translated versions of the class text , native language texts to provide background information on a topic, the  explicit pre-teaching of key vocabulary, visual aids to help with comprehension, and/or manipulatives to provide a visual  model with math content. During coplanning time, the ENL teachers work with the classroom teachers on ways to present the  content of the grade in more visual and accessible ways.  We find short videos that explain the target content through images  as well as simplified explanations, such as "brainpop" and "Sheppherds software".  We find simpler texts that teach the same  content as those recommended in the curriculum and schedule time for the ELLs to work with the simpler texts prior to taking  on the more difficult ones.  We pick out the key vocabulary for the unit and determine how it will be taught explicitly and  whether it should be part of a whole-class lesson by the classroom teachers, or a small group lesson by the ENL teacher.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Newly arrived Spanish-speaking ELLs are evaluated using the Spanish LAB for a standardized assessment of their Native  Language skills. The EL-SOL early literacy skills assessment is used to identify the strengths and weaknesses of Spanish- speaking ELLs who may encounter difficulty in academic work. Students from other language cultures are usually are not  assessed formally using standardized exams. However, the administration may ask bilingual staff members who speak various  languages to translate orally for a student taking an assessment.  This is in the hopes that more useful information will be  garnered as to what content the student is understanding versus what English the student is understanding.  For standardized  math and science exams, ELLs all receive a translated version of the exact same test that their grade peers take in English.  If  these are not available in a child's native language, a translator is hired by the school.  All class work and assessments in the Go  Math curriculum come in a Spanish version which is provided to students as a matter of course throughout the  year.  Additionally, glossaries for math, science and social studies are given to students who can read in their native language,  to help them with key vocabulary in their classes.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE   There are currently 5 ELLs who are officially SIFE students.  Instruction for these students includes remedial small group work   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      with the ENL teacher, the ELA teacher, and student teachers.  When ATRs are in the building, they are often tasked to provide  remedial instruction to these students.  Additionally, SIFE students are routinely invited to the Title III supplementary  programs. These students are also monitored by the AIS as they are at risk academically.     b. Newcomer  There are 44 newcomer ELLs comprising 72% of the ELL population.  As these ELLs are new to the country, in addition to  differentiating instruction, there is an increased outreach to the families.  The parent coordinator notifies these parents of DOE  and DELL workshops and opportunities for them and sometimes accompanies new families to these events.  Additionally,  parents are informed in their preferred language of the major themes of their child's grade and encouraged to talk and read  with them about these themes in their native language, so they don't fall behind in content while they are learning English as a  new language.   Instruction for entering and emerging newcomer ELLs consists of developing phonemic awareness, vocabulary and a  knowledge of English language structures. The activities to develop these skills are embedded in themes which relate to daily  life as well as the content areas.  For example, the third grade entering and emerging pullout group is learning vocabulary  (body parts, descriptive words, scientific concepts of adaptation and hibernation, etc) and fun facts about frogs in anticipation  of the third grade unit "Freaky Frogs" in the Expeditionary Learning curriculum for third grade.  Activities respect a student’s  silent period and the ENL teachers encourage students to participate by pointing, drawing, acting, writing, or listening.  Leveled  books, bilingual materials (including dictionaries and glossaries), listening centers with books on tape and computer programs,  such as imagine learning, are also used to support these ELLs. Adapted materials and strategies which support the new  curricula are also developed by the ENL teachers in conjunction with common branch and content area teachers to foster  comprehension of grade level classroom studies. The ENL teacher and the classroom teachers adapt the classwork according  to the needs of their students communicating with each other via email.  One of the school's goals for math this year is  incorporating more hands on thinking tasks using manipulatives.  These types of activities are beneficial for all students, and  provide a visual, hands-on component to the math curriculum that is more accessible to beginner ELLs.   Instruction for transitioning and expanding newcomer ELLs takes place in their gen ed classroom.  In the case of these  students, the same instructional modifications and supports are used as we use for developing ELLs at the transitioning and  expanding levels. See below.  c. Developing  There are 16 developing ELLs comprising 26% of the ELL population.  Instruction for transitioning and expanding ELLs takes place in their gen ed classroom.  A key part of their instruction is the  ongoing collaboration among all their teachers including the ENL teacher.  Together the team adapts and enhances the school  curriculum to meet the needs of the ELLs by providing explicit vocabulary instruction, previewing challenging readings or  concepts, providing visuals for class content through books with heavy picture support and short videos, and using small group  instruction as much as possible.  As often as scheduling permits, when the ENL teacher is in the general ed classroom, the  whole class is working on target content in designated small groups.  This provides the ELLs with the opportunity to ask more  questions and the ENL teacher to use more teaching strategies particularly important for ELLs, such as enabling  the  pronunciation, repetition and meaningful practice of new vocabulary, and the use of sentence prompts and frames to promote  the use of more sophisticated language.  Additionally, ELLs are prepared for the ELA state test by providing practice materials  which reflect the test format as well as the various skills measured.  However, these ELLs are initially given simpler texts which  reflect the type of activities presented on the ELA but at a lower reading level. These mini lessons incorporate such activities as  underlining important points and circling key words, responding to short answer questions, the reading of various genres, and  the use of graphic organizers to respond to text.  After working a few weeks with lower level materials,  grade level test  preparation materials are utilized and emphasis is placed on finding gist, chunking information, and first answering the  prompts you know before going back and trying out the ones you do not.  Students as well as parents are informed of  modified promotion criteria for newcomers and developing ELLs to alleviate test anxiety.  d.  Long Term ELLs (7+ years)      e. Former ELLs (1-2 years after proficiency)  There are 11 former ELLs comprising 18% of the ELL population.       ELLs who achieve a commanding level on the NYSESLAT continue to receive two periods a week of integrated ENL and all   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      ELL test accommodations on all standardized tests: extended time, bilingual glossaries and/or dictionaries, or translated  versions of the specific test. ENL support at this level is targeted to specific areas of language weakness as shown on the  NYSESLAT and on grade level assessments, such as running records, on demands and unit tests in Go Math.  The ENL teacher  often works one-on-one with the students at this level as they generally have different needs from each other.  However, if  more than one former ELL has the same need as other former ELLs, or even developing ELLs, in the same classroom, they can  be grouped together for a strategy group.  One example of support provided for former ELLs is in the fifth grade classroom is  when the ENL teacher pushes into math and works with a group of three former ELLs on word problems which incorporate the  math concepts of the current unit.  These word problems are created ahead of time by the classroom teacher and the ENL  teacher based on data from prior assessments.   Another example of support provided for a former ELL is one fourth grader  who continues to have spelling and decoding issues even though her reading comprehension as well as the content of her  writing are on grade level.  After looking over her most recent writing pieces, the classroom teacher, together with the ENL  teacher, identified certain spelling patterns and basic sight words that she was still misspelling.  Together they created a pile of  flashcards which are reviewed daily with the student.  A schedule was created for who would review the words with her each  day (either the classroom teacher, the ENL teacher, or a student teacher).  The teachers use a variety of memorization  strategies such as, look,spell, say, cover, write, check to help her review.   Six words are studied at a time.  When one is  mastered, it is replaced by a new word. These are some types of support provided to former ELLs.  Others include guided or  strategy groups, one-on-one conferring, reteaching of a lesson that the student didn't understand, and providing native  language versions of the homework assignments using google translate or trade book translations, so families can help at  home.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELLs with Special Needs develop and adapt grade level strategies and materials to support literacy and content  area knowledge. Most scaffolding strategies used for ELLs are also appropriate for ELL SWDs.  These strategies include explicit  vocabulary instruction, the repetition of directions, shared reading, clear visuals, hands on activities or manipulatives to  enhance understanding of new concepts, and chunking information/text into coherent but brief segments.  ELL SWDs with  processing delays are given more time and a heads up in advance of being called on.  ELLs with special needs usually have IEPs  indicating the areas of need associated with their learning disabilities. The needs of ELLs in this subgroup are met by the ENL  and general education teachers in conjunction with the special education teachers and related service providers, including  speech, as well as occupational and physical therapists. Students with fine motor delays may be provided with pencil grips and  when appropriate the ENL teacher will scribe for the student.  Students who have trouble organizing information will get  graphic organizers with transition words already filled in, such as first, next, then, etc and if necessary a key word or picture  next to each step.  Modifications made for ELLs with special needs are very individualized depending on their specific  disabilities.  For entering and emerging students, the presentation and practice of content is already so scaffolded that ELLs  with disabilities may not need to have many additional scaffolds in place.  However, as the ELLs with special needs become  more fluent in English and move to the transitioning and expanding levels, they often require more or different adaptation  than the other ELLs at their English acquisition level.  Often the speech and ENL teachers work together to target the same  vocabulary, so the SWD-ELLs with word retrieval issues get more opportunities for practice.  SWD ELLs may continue to use  graphic organizers that focus on organization after other ELLs no longer need them.  SWD ELLs with memory issues are allowed  to re-watch content videos or re-read content texts more times than the rest of the class.   Many of the ELLs in this category are invited to participate in Title III programs to give further support in their specified area of  academic need.  Additionally, there are two extensive libraries in the ESL classroom, one with leveled texts and the other with  thematic book baskets.  Books for these libraries have been chosen because they are grade appropriate and high interest, but  are written specifically for ELLs and/or students below grade level in reading.  All ELLs are encouraged to borrow books from  these libraries.   Subscriptions to the computer program "Imagine learning" are provided to ELLs with special needs who struggle with reading  and vocabulary.  This computer program is designed to support language development as well as struggling learners.  It adjusts  to the student's current reading and language levels and provides native language support as well.    Additionally, books on CD  and ebooks are used to promote fluency and decoding skills for struggling readers.  ELLs with IEPs are also entitled to register  on "Bookshare" for free, an audio library that they can log into from any computer with internet and choose the           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ENL teachers confer with classroom teachers and related service providers for scheduling as well as instructional planning. ENL  and related service providers make sure that every student gets his or her mandated units without being pulled from another  mandated service.  Depending on English acquisition level and IEP goals, providers either scaffold the work of the child’s  classroom or work on more basic skills that a student may need.  Entering and emerging ELLs-SWDs are included in standalone  and integrated ENL groups of general education ELLs when receiving ENL services. Transitioning and expanding ELLs-SWDs get  their integrated ENL support along with the general education ELLs at the same language acquisition level.  All ELLs-SWDs are  included in all special programs and activities conducted by the school during the day as well as after school. Such activities  include but are not limited to sports teams, band, chorus, musical/theatrical performances, class trips, middle school electives  and advisory groups and many other activities which are conducted throughout the school year. Activities such as Middle  School Electives and Sports Teams capitalize on the interests and talents of all ELLs.           8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention programs for ELLs work differently in different grade spans.  Grades 5 and 8 have specific period in their  schedule designated for remedial small-group instruction of math and reading skills.  These groups are formed based on need  and changed throughout the year as students grow and change.  Need is determined by running record results and skill- specific teacher made math assessments.  Out of classroom, as well as grade level teachers are involved in teaching these  small intervention groups.  ELLs are grouped along with their non ELL peers based on targeted specific needs determined by  assessment.  In the case of math, native language translation is used when there is a question about whether difficulty with a  math assessment is the result of limited math skills or developing English skills.  This targeted intervention takes place twice a  week for 50 minutes. In grades k-4 each grade has a 50-minute period daily dedicated for small group reading or reading  related skills.  The groups are determined by independent reading level based on running record results and taught by the  grade level teachers as well as the out of classroom teachers including the ENL teacher.  This synchronizing of schedules allows  ELLs of all proficiency levels to get reading instruction at their current reading level (whether with the ENL teacher or with a  different teacher according to their needs) without missing out on whole-group classroom instruction time.  For struggling ELLs  in all grades, at-risk SETTS and/or speech is offered if the respective teachers have room in an appropriate group targeting the  specific area in which the ELL student is struggling.  In some cases, placement in an ICT class as a gen ed student is considered  as a possible academic intervention because the classwork is generally more scaffolded and there are two teachers in the  classroom.       Through Title III funding, an ESL after school program is offered for newcomer ELLs in most grades.  ELLs are invited to  participate in a 10-week intensive after school program from 2:40-4:00 two days a week.  An ENL and math teacher deliver  targeted instruction to improve second language acquisition, literacy and math skills. In math, word problems are analysed  carefully by the teacher and students together, slowly breaking down the language involved in math problems.  For language  and literacy, shared readings on a theme are presented and practiced and accompanied by hand-on follow up activities related  to the current theme.  Last year, for example, the younger groups studied the five senses as their theme.        Struggling ELLs are referred to the Academic Intervention Team (AIT).  Teachers may present the case of their student to a  panel of teachers and administrators on AIT, who suggest targeted tier I or tier II interventions.  After a teacher has exhausted  all interventions, a formal process of referral may be considered.  Based on a review of the student's independent work, a  review of any work/assessments given in the child's native language, anecdotals from teachers and input from the student's  parent, AIT sometimes opens an initial referral in SESIS requesting a bilingual special education evaluation.      Advisory groups are held with 5  th  grade ELLs to provide support in choosing appropriate middle schools and filling out an  effective application. Multilingual informational materials are provided and ELLs are guided to choose those middle schools  with appropriate bilingual and/or ESL programs that will address their needs.  Although this is not an academic intervention, it  is an important support for their academic futures.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      "Imagine learning" and "Raz kids" are two computer interventions which the school subscribes to in order to provide academic  and language development support to struggling ELLs.  Imagine learning provides native language support in over 20 languages  and Raz kids provides native language support for Spanish and French speakers.  Both programs include their own pre and post  assessments which are viewed by the ENL teacher to inform instruction and provide more information about the progress of  the students.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      In the past ENL services at this school have been primarily pullout.  The new emphasis on coplanning and integrated ENL  instruction represents a new approach to supporting our ELLs and this change will hopefully  result in greater academic success  for our ELL population.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs. Read Ahead is a program in which local professionals come in to the  school once a week to read with a student during his or her lunch period.  It is an excellent opportunity for ELLs to develop all  their English language skills areas.  All emerging, transitioning, and expanding ELLs are invited to participate.  Letters of  explanation and permission slips are sent home in the preferred language of the parents.  Students who do not return the  permission slips are sent another.    All students in grade 3 are taught chess by a professional chess teacher who comes into  the school once a week.  All students in third grade participate including the ELLs.  Sports and Arts is a free after school  program for grades k-5 on the premises from 2:40 to 6:00 daily.  The parent coordinator helps families with the  application.  Any parents who request an after school program are directed to Maria Galimide, who is the attendance school  aid who also helps run the after school program.  Space is limited, so new families often have to be on the waiting list until a  space opens for their children.  It is a first come, first serve program.     A professional violin teacher comes to the school to  work with fourth and fifth grade students who sign up for lunch period lessons.  Informational letters and permission slips are  sent home in the parents preferred languages and resent if no response is received.  ELLs are also included on the basketball,  baseball,boxing and soccer teams coached by the Physical Education teachers after school.  All students who want to  participate are allowed to do so.  Information letters and permission slips are given out and collected by the Physical Education  teachers in parents' preferred languages.  The Title III after school program is offered yearly to selected ELLs (usually the all the  newcomers) throughout the grades to support growth in literacy and math. Invitations are sent by the ENL teacher in parents'  preffered languages and follow up calls are made by the ENL teacher.         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Big books are widely used in the primary grades to teach basic reading skills and vocabulary.There is a full leveled library in the  ENL classroom and students are encouraged to borrow books at their level regularly. Teachers use laptaps in their classrooms  to give students access to educational programs, such as starfall, imagine learning, and Raz Kids. There are smart boards in  every classroom, which allow teachers to make lessons more visual.  The science teacher uses hands on experiments to make  the science content comprehensible and memorable.  He also uses BrainPop science which provides entertaining visual aids to  explain science concepts.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   ENL is our only program.  Home language supports are provided as much as possible.  Imagine Learning is a software program  designed specifically for ELLs which provides native language support.  All entering and emerging ELLs in grades 2-8 are  provided with accounts.  The math program,  Go Math, has Spanish language books which are provided for all Spanish  speaking ELLs along with the English version. Google translate is used to translate reading passages about key content.  Fully  bilingual students are sometimes called upon to translate for their non-English speaking peers.  If done in moderation, this  bolsters the confidence of students acting as teachers and highlights the usefulness of bilingualism.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Teachers on each grade level meet weekly with service providers including the ENL teacher to discuss the current units of  study and how the material may need to be adapted or scaffolded.  Also, the administrators regularly observe classes and take  learning walks throughout the school to ensure that teachers are effective and instruction is on point.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Big books are widely used in the primary grades to teach basic reading skills and vocabulary.There is a full leveled library in the  ENL classroom and students are encouraged to borrow books at their level regularly. Teachers use laptaps in their classrooms  to give students access to educational programs, such as starfall, imagine learning, and Raz Kids. There are smart boards in  every classroom, which allow teachers to make lessons more visual.  The science teacher uses hands on experiments to make  the science content comprehensible and memorable.  He also uses BrainPop science which provides entertaining visual aids to  explain science concepts.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELLs are assigned buddies by their classroom teachers to keep track of them when the class goes to specials  and lunch.  Whenever possible, they are sat at a table in the classroom with someone who speaks their native language, at  least until they get comfortable. If they are truly non-English speaking, we provide alternative homework so they can feel  successful rather than overwhelmed.  At the mandated parent orientation, the ENL teacher makes sure to reassure parents  that newly arrived students are exempt from all promotional standards, meaning that while we expect them to do their best,  we know that in many cases they won't be functioning on grade level in English for a while and they won't be held back  because of it.  If a student is particularly traumatized by their situation, the guidance counselor, Darice Scholl, usually gets  involved by giving some extra attention and time to the student and contacting the families.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    There are no language electives offered at this school.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Paste response to question here:           Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Every Monday from 2:40 -4:00 the whole staff gathers for a professional development session.  All teachers of ELLs are  included in these PDs.  The first four week PD cycle focused on small group work, especially on running records, both how to  administer them and how to use the data to inform instruction.  ENL teachers worked closely with the grade level ELA teachers  who have ELLs in their classrooms reviewing running record data and using it to form groups and plan instruction.  The second  four week PD cycle focused on conferring, especially on setting specific goals during a reading, writing, or math conference  with a student and keeping a record in order to check back on the student's progress.  The third four week PD cycle is focussing   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         on questioning techniques, especially on changing the current norm of teachers asking most of the questions to a more  student-centered model of students asking questions and piggybacking on other students questions.  Also, PD highlights the  need for more open ended and higher order thinking questions in the classrooms at all ages.  Once this cycle of PD is complete,  the PDs will spiral around again, looking at small group work, conferring and questioning again, but expanding on our previous  learning.  Although these PDs are generalized, it is extremely important for ENL teachers to be present to provide input about  how these topics can be approached with ELLs at all levels as well as to learn from colleagues and staff developers.   Each ESL teacher has the opportunity to attend professional development sessions offered by the Division of ELL support  throughout the year.  It is up to the ENL teachers to identify training sessions that would help them develop as a teacher and  ask permission from the principal to attend.  Information about available professional development opportunities for ENL  teachers is emailed directly to ENL teachers from the DOELLs bimonthly facilitating the process of insuring access to quality,  relevant PD options for ENL teachers.  Also intervisitations among staff at 111 as well as the opportunity to visit ENL  classrooms in other schools is allowed.  When staff developers come in to the school to work with common branch teachers,  ENL teachers are encouraged to be a part of that learning as scheduling permits.    Classroom teachers and/or ENL teachers sometimes attend workshops at Teachers College and turnkey their learning at grade  meetings.   Throughout the year ESL teachers attend workshops provided by Teacher's College and OELL which address aligning the  curriculum for ELLs with the Common Core Standards.  Some of these workshops include planning sessions wherein ENL  Teachers plan lesson/units based on the Common Core.  One such workshop focused on close reading with ELLs and explored  the technique of highlighting referents and looking at what they refer back to as one close reading strategy that can be helpful  with transitioning and expanding ELLs.  Another workshop highlighted techniques for choosing which words to pre-teach and  how to do so, before a reading comprehension activity.  One workshop was for ENL teachers and math teachers to attend  together and focused on math vocabulary and language and strategies to make it more comprehensible to ELLs.  Another  opportunity which will be explored for the first time this year, is partnering up with the nearby P.S. 51 to adapt lessons from  the Expeditionary Learning curriculum used by both schools.   During full PD days, such as election day, grade groups meet to  break down upcoming units and then the ENL teacher meets with the classroom teachers who have ELLs in their classes to  further plan how the unit can be scaffolded for ELLs at different stages of language acquisition.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The Guidance Counselors, Darice Scholl and Stephanie Wilds respectively, support ELLs in conjunction with the ENL teacher as  they transition to Middle School and High School by having meetings with parents to review procedures and  requirements.   Although they are not trained specifically in working with ELLs, they are the most knowledgeable staff  members about the application process as they have been specifically trained in it and have many years of experience.  When  it comes to working with the ELLs on this process, they work in conjunction with the ENL teachers and utilize the translation  services of other staff members as well.  The Guidance staff in the Middle School also organizes weekly advisories for ELLs in  Middle school who participate in small groups directed by individual teachers.  The fifth grade ESL teacher, Ms. Singer, works  with the fifth grade ELLs in a small group helping them understand what to look for in a middle school and how the application  process works.  Parents and students are encouraged to visit the Borough-wide middle school or high school fairs as well as  informational sessions at various schools to obtain additional information. All ELLs are provided with guides to the various  middle or high schools in their native language to bring home to their families.      Every Monday, professional development is provided for the staff from 2:40 to 4:00.  Some of this PD will directly address how  teachers can best address the needs of their ELLs.  This focus on ELL instruction is noted on the agenda for the PD and staff  who attend sign an attendance sheet.  It is up to individual teachers to keep track of these hours for themselves.  Additionally,  common branch teachers are encouraged to attend OELL and TC workshops which focus on meeting the needs of ELLs in the  gen-ed classroom.  Certificates of attendance are given out at these trainings and individual teachers are expected to keep  them as proof of their ELL-related training.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Annual meetings are scheduled during the mandated parent communication times on Tuesday afternoons.  If parents cannot  come at this time, a more convenient time is scheduled.  As a last resort, a phone meeting is conducted in lieu of a face to  face  meeting.  These annual meetings begin in January and continue through June.  As the whole staff is required to be here at that  time anyway, bilingual employees are asked to attend as translators where appropriate.  Otherwise, the translation unit is  utilized.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   We have parent volunteers (formerly through Learning Leaders) in our school which we have expanded to include 17 new  parents this year.  Once they finish the training they will be assigned to classrooms throughout the school (not their own  child's classroom) and one of their roles will be assisting the ELLs as directed by the classroom teacher.  P.S.111 also has an active PTA that holds monthly parent meetings and has a Parent Room in the school. The following is an  overview of the activities sponsored by the PTA:  • The PTA provides information to parents regarding school activities and develops fund-raising activities to support the  school.  • The PTA regularly provides information from the District Office about changes and on-going events that occur in the DOE.  • The PTA distributes and posts flyers about on-going family events happening in the school.   The PTA also serves as a forum for parents to vocalize their needs            Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Edward Gilligan, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS111 Alfred S.

If there is more than one LAC, list all.     First Name    Last Name    Title    Has the LAC attended a   2018-19 training   The LAC was involved in  the development of this   conducted by the Field   plan? Yes/No          Language Access   Coordinator? Yes/No       (*Primary)             * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The administration, parent coordinator and staff were surveyed verbally to assess written translation and oral  interpretation needs for the school community. Additionally, parent responses to preferred language of contact  included on the Home Language Survey is also used to address the linguistic needs of the parent community when  preparing communications about school activities. The Home Language Surveys are on file and information is  collected from these documents and is also available on the RPOB report on ATS. The Pupil Accounting Secretary  also sends a Parents Preferred Language Form home which surveys parent language preferences for written and  oral communication with the school. This information is placed in ATS for easy access and retrieval. The major  findings revealed a need for written translation and oral interpretation in Spanish, Arabic and Chinese. The school  has 17 languages in addition to English. The largest numbers in descending order: Spanish 87, Arabic 28, Japanese  12, Chinese 8, Bengali 6. These findings are shared with the school community by formulating lists of students  including the home language of parents and their translation/interpretation needs. The lists are distributed to  each staff member with a master list to be maintained in the main office.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    Albanian, Arabic,  Bengali, Cantonese,  Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole,  Hindi, Japanese, Korean,  Philipino, Russian,  Sidamo, Spanish, Thai,  Tibetan, and Urdu.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.            Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      Document Name    Month/Frequency Distributed to   How do you plan to translate?   Families    Include procedures to ensure timely  provision of translated documents      to parents.       The primary letters that occur with  repetition are PTA announcements,  parent-teacher conferences, after- school programs, extended-day  instruction, testing dates, class  newsletters, and curriculum  information. We identify these at the  start of the school year.            2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as   parent-teacher   conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      Meeting Name    Month/Frequency of Meetings    How does your school plan to   provide interpretation service(s)?          Parent-teacher conferences and back  to school nights are the primary times  that we have face to face  conversations that require translation  services. There are times when an  unforseen meeting takes place (i.e.  guidance) for which we require  translation.            3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.               Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.                Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Signs will be posted in all languages with language translation information at the front desk, and in the Parent  Coordinator's office. Parents were also provided their Bill of Rights in their native language or with instructions for  accessing translation services.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We will work with our Parent Coordinator and PTA to periodically assess the effectiveness of our communication by  surveying families.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66
