This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview      OVERVIEW   Mission   Our mission is to create a positive and collaborative community which empowers students to build character, master  skills, and become lifelong learners.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9               2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Vision Statement   Our vision is to build strong, positive connections with students so they can independently and confidently achieve  academic success and contribute to making a better world.   Mission Statement   Our mission is to create a positive and collaborative community which empowers students to build character, master  skills, and become lifelong learners.   Our Definition of Discovery   Discovery is the process by which curiosity leads us to inquire, to search for answers, to test out our ideas and to  collaborate with other to find the extraordinary in the ordinary. When we discover, we wonder, ask questions, make  observations, pull things apart and put them back together to learn something new. We believe that discovery  unfolds through the balance of process and product. When we travel the roads of discovery, we must keep our  destination in mind but allow for detours along the way.   Our Values   The educators of the NYC Academy for Discovery, PS 306Q, are dedicated professionals who are caring, creative, and  enthusiastic. We believe every student can be successful. This is shown through collaboration, high expectations, and  respect for all.   Instructional Focus   Teachers will ensure that assessments and experiences enhance each other to strengthen students' background  knowledge and engagement with learning. Text-based activities will take place in addition to rich, shared experiential  learning through hands-on projects, activities, and trips. Students will reflect on their experiences and understanding  of new content.   The New York City Academy for Discovery is a PK-5th grade elementary school located in Woodhaven, Queens. The  school is Title I funded and comprised of 392 students. The school’s population consists of 67.09% Hispanic, 18.11%  Asian, 5.61% Black, 2.81% White, 4.08% Native American, 1.53% Multi-Racial and 0.77% Hawaiian/Pacific Islander.  The student body includes 53.83% males and 46.17% females with 16.84% English Language Learners. Students with  disabilities make up 17.35% of the population. The attendance rate year to date is 93.29%.   P.S. 306Q - New York City Academy for Discovery, is a diverse school community dedicated to educating the whole  child. Our school utilizes EL Education, a blended-literacy program incorporating reading and writing into a 135- minute block. We began our journey with EL Education in September 2017 with grades 3-5 and included grades K-2 in  September 2018. For grades K-2, the literacy block is comprised of the one-hour foundational Skills Block, which  includes a phonics mini-lesson and differentiated literacy centers based on students' data-driven literacy phase. The  remaining portion of the content-based literacy block includes an opening to the lesson, student work time where  they work collaboratively with peers, and a closing where students reflect upon their learning. Grades 3-5 also engage  in a content-based literacy block which includes an opening, student work time and closing with word study and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      vocabulary embedded into the lessons. In addition, data-driven, guided reading groups and literacy stations are  facilitated during the 135-minute block. Social-Emotional Learning, Science, Social studies, and technology content are  integrated throughout the lessons for all grades. Teachers design higher-order thinking questions and engage  students in content-rich discussions daily to build language and critical thinking skills in literacy. Students take  ownership of their own learning through creating the success criteria for each lesson, developing rubrics for tasks and  projects, revising and editing their own work and engaging in both self and peer assessment based on the criteria and  rubrics they created. In August of 2018, we were awarded a grant to partner with EL Education and the Robin Hood  Foundation for Learning and Technology, which will provide us with professional learning opportunities throughout  the 2018-19 school year via in-house coaching and support in curriculum and instruction. Also this year, P.S. 306Q has  the opportunity to work with a Universal Literacy Coach. Through this work, we seek to develop the knowledge and  skills of teachers in the areas of early reading and writing acquisition, instruction and assessment. Finally, technology  is integrated into our literacy instruction with the use of i-Ready, an online diagnostic, progress monitoring, and  instructional tool, to provide students additional support in literacy. Students are able to utilize the i-Ready program  daily during centers or stations and at home.   Our school utilizes the Go Math program. Grades K-2 have a 75-minute math block and grades 3-5 have a 90-minute  math block. As part of our collaboration with the Algebra for All initiative and the Learning Partners Program, one of  our next steps as a school community is to make a shift from the "I Do, We Do, You Do" model to "You Do, We Do, I  Do" also known as the "Upside Down Teaching Model". Our math block will consist of, but not be limited to, the  following: Facilitate Data Driven Centers and Small Group Instruction Using Assessment Data, Present Students with a  Rich Problem to Solve, Focus on Discourse and Communication of Strategies, Model the Correct Syntax, Mini-Lesson  and Guided Practice, Independent Practice and Closure/Final Assessment. The students will have the opportunity to  engage in i-Ready during math stations (3-5), to diagnose and progress monitor students' math skills, while providing  targeted, leveled support through the online database. Teachers will also utilize higher-order thinking questions and  math reflections to enhance student engagement and maximize critical thinking within the content. During math,  students engage in deep meaningful, content-based discussions, challenge one another's thinking using accountable  talk, and monitor their own learning through self and peer assessment and utilizing student discussion rubrics. For the  2018-19 school year, we have departmentalized our fourth and fifth grade classes. The math teachers will attend the  required Algebra for All professional learning session, participate in intervisitaitons with other schools, and will turn- key relevant mathematics practices to all teachers. To strengthen our school's capacity to engage in continuous  improvement with mathematics instruction and learning, we received a grant from the Learning Partners Program  (LPP). A triad has been formed with two additional partnering schools with whom we will engage in math data  analysis, labsites, and intervisitations. The impact of this work will be measured through test scores, student  discussions, teacher observations, and student work products.   All classroom teachers are responsible for teaching social studies and character education. Grades K-5 utilize Passport  to Social Studies. Teachers collaborate to plan trips and design minds-on and hands-on learning projects which are  linked to our instructional focus-Connecting Learning to Experience. In our effort to maintain the social-emotional  health of our students, we have implemented a Social Emotional Learning (SEL) program, Sanford Harmony. SEL is  targeted to teach students five main social-emotional competencies: Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social  Awareness, Relationship Skills, and Responsible Decision Making. Harmony supports the teaching of the SEL  competencies by teaching students five social-emotional themes: Diversity and Inclusion, Empathy, Communication,  Problem Solving, and Peer Relationships. We have since aligned our Book of the Month program with these themes,  where we use character education stories to teach the character theme or domain of focus. At the end of each  month, one grade presents a character themed pep rally. One student from each class is awarded a certificate for  displaying that character theme throughout the month. In addition to character-themed awards, we also present  students with the student of the month awards, based on academic achievement, perseverance, and integrity. Perfect  attendance awards are distributed during Family Discovery Day. Assemblyman Mike Miller also provides our students  with student of the month awards. We love to celebrate our students.   Every classroom is equipped with large amounts of technology equipment: laptops, iPads, desktops, and SMART  boards. Our school received a $135,000 Reso-A grant in 2015 to update our existing computer lab with 30 new  computers and our third floor classrooms with 9 new SMART interactive panels. In 2016-17, we received $40,000 in a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Reso-A grant and purchased 5 more SMART interactive panels for second floor classrooms. During the 2015-16 school  year, we added a technology teacher to our instructional team. In 2017-18, our school obtained another Reso-A Grant  for $75,000 to purchase 8 SmartBoards, 9 printers and 24 laptops. Students in grades K-5 receive technology  instruction weekly. The technology teacher collaborates with the classroom teachers to edit and publish various units  of study. In the technology lab, students are exploring and learning to use computers to facilitate everyday life. This  includes being able to navigate the desktop effectively and create, save, and later locate documents. Through a series  of projects, students in the early childhood grades are learning to use each part of the computer appropriately and  adeptly, and upper elementary students are learning and practicing proper keyboarding techniques. Older students  will also work together to create presentations using Microsoft PowerPoint, animated videos and games using coding,  and live action videos and podcasts to supplement the content knowledge they are learning in their respective  classrooms. Students will also be learning coding to create and share animated videos. Teachers, students, and  parents have access to many online academic In addition to i-Ready as mentioned above, we also utilize Imagine  Learning, Rosetta Stone, and Reading A-Z.    Our school implements a hands-on approach to scientific learning using the Amplify science curriculum and science  scope and sequence in grades K-5. Through investigations and experiments, students gain scientific knowledge,  observe objects and events, think about how they relate to what is known, test their ideas in logical ways, and  generate explanations that integrate the new information into their understanding of the natural world. Students are  then able to apply that knowledge to solve real world problems. Our program also has a strong focus on scientific  literacy and writing to prepare students for life in an increasingly complex scientific and technological world. Each  year, our school hosts a Science Fair during the March Student Led Conferences. All students in grades 3-5 are  required to conduct an experiment and display their findings during the Science Fair. For grades PK-2, classrooms  conduct experiments as a group and present their findings on a tri-fold during the Fair.   Our Physical Education program is a comprehensive and dynamic program that is based around the NYC Department  of Education’s suggested Physical Best curriculum. A variety of games and activities are incorporated within lessons  and units connected to NYS Physical Education Standards to ensure that each student receives a well-rounded  Physical Education program. All classes K-5 receive two periods of physical education weekly. Students participate in  FitnessGram fitness tests to evaluate their physical fitness levels through three fitness domains: flexibility, aerobic  endurance and muscular strength. Programs, such as Mighty Milers, Move-to-Improve, and Cross Training club have  been implemented to help prepare students for these tests. In addition, we have implemented a variety of events  within the program. In June, our staff, students and parents participate in Field Day where games and activities are  incorporated into a fun-filled day. This day is coupled with Bring Your Child to Work Day in an effort to build culture  and climate. Students also participate in an annual dance-a-thon for charity. In 2016, we supported Cohen Children's  Medical Center; in 2017, we supported Ronald McDonald House Charities of Charleston, SC; and in 2018, we raised  funds for the Alzheimer's Association. These organizations have impacted the lives of staff members who share their  stories with the school community increasing student impact and understanding of service learning. Our Physical  Education program provides our students with the necessary tools and information that are needed to pursue a  lifelong active and healthy lifestyle.   P.S. 306Q is committed to educating the whole child through the arts. We have full-time visual arts and theater  teachers. All students receive at least one period of visual arts instruction weekly throughout the year. Students learn  a variety of drawing, painting, and sculpting techniques and study various artists, such as Keith Haring, Georgia  O'Keefe, and Georges Seurat. As a result, the students create a variety of pieces, including collages, drawings,  paintings, printmaking, sculptures, and crafts. Specific artists are also introduced throughout many units, as are the  endless career opportunities sought within the visual arts. Learning through hands on art activities, reading, writing,  and listening activities help accommodate learners at all levels. Through our visual arts program, students are able to  connect artistic learning experiences to real life experiences. Our main goal is for all students to build confidence as  artists, students, and as well-rounded individuals. Students have the opportunity to showcase their artistic talents  through our Art Fair held during Student Led Conferences in November.   Our theater program serves all students in grades PK-5. Students will gain access to literacy in a new way  incorporating movement and creative expression through acting, singing, and dancing. Since May of 2016, our school   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      has hosted yearly musicals such as Aladdin Kids, Willy Wonka Kids, and Lion King Kids. This year, our students will  perform Seussical, Jr. During the 2017-18 school year, our theater teacher presented two additional performances to  our parent community. Our 3-5 grade students participated in a variety show called 'Star Searching Through the  States' during which they showcased their talents through singing and dancing to songs that celebrated the United  States of America. K-1st grade students created short films by acting out familiar storybooks, fairy tales, or poems.  The films were presented during the Film Festival where each movie was showcased for parents.    Special Education at P.S. 306 Q is not solely the responsibility of special education teachers, but every single member  of our school community and works to develop students skills and abilities so that they can reach their Least  Restrictive Environment and make progress in the general education curriculum. Members of this team include school  administrators, classroom teachers, paraprofessionals, occupational therapist, social worker, school psychologist,  school counselor and IEP teacher who meet monthly as a professional learning community to debrief about research  based interventions, and best practices. Currently, there are three self-contained bridge classes (K-1-2, 2-3-4, & 4-5)  and one ICT class on each grade from first grade through fifth grade. We actively monitor the academic, social- emotional, and physical progress of the students in this program, modifying IEPs as needed so that the IEP is truly a  current individualized education plan for our students. Classroom teachers provide access into the curriculum through  differentiated instructional practices and incorporating multiple learning styles. P.S. 306 utilizes preventative  measures prior to recommending students for special education services. Our Response-to-Intervention (RtI) plan is  coordinated by our IEP teacher who works with classroom teachers to identify and provide RtI support to students  indicated as being in need of academic intervention services. With the assistance of special education teachers,  identified students in grades K-5 are provided with 3-4 periods of ELA or math support weekly, facilitated in 12-week  cycles. At the end of each cycle, student progress data is analyzed and continued level of support is determined for  each student.    The New York City Academy for Discovery is committed to the success of all students. In order to effectively serve our  16.84% English as a New Language (ENL) learners population and their parents, we have two full-time ENL teachers  and a bi-lingual parent coordinator. In addition, one classroom teacher holds a TESOL license. Our ENL teachers serve  our K-5 students through a stand-alone and integrated program. Based on individual student needs, a stand-alone  model is used for beginner ENLs. Teachers use programs such as Rosetta Stone, Language Power and Imagine  Learning along with phonics, reading and writing support to help students meet grade-level standards. ENL teachers  meet with grade-level teams during their teacher team meetings on a weekly basis, in order to align curriculum and  provide ENL strategies for teachers to use during instruction. Various parent workshops and celebratory events are  provided throughout the year for parents of ENLs, both in English and their native language, when possible.  Workshops provide parents with information and strategies to supporting their child’s academic success. ENL  teachers have also hosted parent/student breakfasts including a Valentines, Mother’s Day and Father’s day craft  event where students and parents enjoyed breakfast and created a special craft together. Parents were also given an  opportunity to discuss their child’s academic progress and engage with other families of ENL students.   All teachers are invested in analyzing trends on their grade and creating specific activities geared toward those trends  and have made much growth in this endeavor over the past year. Grade level teams meet twice a month during  Monday professional learning time for inquiry to analyze student work, modify lesson plans/materials, and  incorporate the ELA/math instructional shifts and academic and personal behaviors. This inquiry process has provided  teachers with the opportunity to analyze data and trends and design actionable plans. Our vertical inquiry team  meets monthly to discuss common trends in literacy and math across the school. Teams also will make use of a  school-wide, shared data system through our Google Suite. To ensure curriculum alignment and cohesion, all teams  have access to this important data to promote student progress and achievement. Further supports to promote  alignment and cohesion among all constituents are evident through the use of Google Classrooms, a vehicle for  sharing data. We created a website supported by Google to continue to share events, information, professional  learning documents, team meeting agendas and minutes, SEL and guidance information, cluster team program  information, messages from the principal and our parent coordinator and more.   Through service learning and enrichment clubs, students gain access into another side of education, in addition to  academia. Throughout the school year, students in grades K-5 have the opportunity to participate in enrichment clubs   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      during the school day facilitated by classroom and cluster teachers. A variety of clubs are offered to each grade level  such as theater, chorus, yoga, scrap booking, sports, technology, cooking, arts and crafts, Zumba, magazine making,  fitness and nutrition, and yearbook. In addition to these extracurricular activities, for four consecutive years, our  students have participated in CookShop, a hands-on program where students learn about making healthy food  choices while making recipes in class. Each grade K-5 engage in a service learning project throughout the year, in an  effort to increase student awareness of the world around them. Throughout the 2017-18 school year, students have  conducted a coat and pajama drive, donated items to "Placemat for a Cause," sent holiday care packages to children  in hospitals, made holiday cards for and visited people in a nursing home, and raised money for Hurricane Harvey and  Hurricane Maria victims. This year, students will continue to support our local and worldwide communities through a  Muscular Dystrophy hop-a-thon and a dance-a-thon.   Our school has an Social Emotional Learning Steering Committee that oversees the implementation of SEL within our  school and at home. The team utilizes the acronym P.A.C.K.: Positive, Accountable, Collaborative, Kind; traits that are  taught to the students as behavior expectations in all settings throughout the school. Our school mascot, the wolf,  visits students during special events throughout the year. The SEL handbook was developed and describes the  expectations of the program. In addition, all classes K-5 at P.S. 306 utilize ClassDojo as our primary way to track and  monitor student behavior. ClassDojo is an online data tracking system where students can earn or lose points based  on behavior in predetermined areas called 'buttons.' Our Dojo 'buttons' are all aligned with the Academic and  Personal Behaviors Rubric. Through this system, students can earn Dojo points for demonstrating positive behaviors  in all settings around the school. Students can spend their Dojo points in their class Dojo store, where they can  purchase tangible incentives, or purchase items off of the Incentives Menu, a menu of non-tangible items such as  time on an iPad, shadow your role model, sit with a friend, etc. ClassDojo has also become a primary way teachers can  connect with parents. Parents can monitor their child's behavior throughout the day or message the teacher about  school-related questions or concerns.    NYCAD has established excellent partnerships with community-based organizations. Our on-going partnership with  the Greater Ridgewood Youth Council (GRYC) has enabled approximately 150 students in grades K-5 to attend a free  after-school program that offers various opportunities such as homework help, STEAM experiences, test preparation,  arts and crafts, creative writing, dance, chorus, technology and coding. We recognize how critical parents’ roles are in  the lives of their children. As a result, we have collaborated with GRYC to increase parent involvement in our school  through a variety of experiences: Winter Wonderland, a holiday toy drive, Bingo night, and a food drive for food  pantries.   By providing more opportunities for parents to attend a diverse selection of workshops and engagement  opportunities, we anticipate a strong partnership with our parent community that will ensure the best possible  educational experience for students and parents alike. Each month our school hosts Family Discovery Day; a day on  which parents are welcome to visit their child's classroom during any time they choose to see what their child is  learning and hopefully gain tips on how they can assist their child at home. Each grade-level team hosts parent  workshops throughout the year such as: Learning Through Play, using i-Ready, test preparation practices, and  strategies for math, ELA, and writing. Our school has partnered with CookShop and the NYC Food Bank for five  consecutive years, providing students and parents opportunities to learn about and make healthy food choices. In  addition to the in-class lessons, parents are invited to six parent workshops each year, where they make recipes with  their children. During the school year, students attend many class trips connecting their learning in the classroom to  experiences outside the classroom. Parent chaperones are an integral part of facilitating a safe and successful class  trip.   The 2018-2019 Comprehensive Education Plan was designed in collaboration with the School Leadership Team and  the staff of P.S. 306 (via CEP Teams: Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment, Collaborative Teachers, Effective  School Leadership, Strong Family-Community Ties), including administrators, classroom teachers, out-of-classroom  teachers, cluster and ENL teachers, paraprofessionals, school counselor, and the parent coordinator.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14      3.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our school has made the most progress with element Effective School Leadership. Through the tailored observation  and post-observation process, our teachers receive targeted, 1-on-1 professional learning and feedback from one of  two administrators for each observation. This, along with administrator-directed and teacher-directed inter- visitations, has had a tremendous impact on student learning, teacher professional growth, and creating a culture of  learning.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 27Q306   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   417   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

In an effort to meet our CEP goal for the 2017-18 school year, P.S. 306 implemented multiple instructional and  professional learning supports for teachers and students. Licenses were purchased for all students in K-5 for the i- Ready, a program which provides individualized instruction and a valid and reliable growth measure through an online  program. Students had access to i-Ready during ELA centers and stations to support direct instruction and had online  access at home. P.S. 306 also partnered with Early Reading Matters(ERM), a program for teachers to develop the  content knowledge and instructional expertise critical for improving student literacy in grades K-3. Teachers were  provided with year-long mentoring, 1-on-1 coaching, co-teaching, modeling, and intervisitations from the ERM  literacy specialist. Both i-Ready and ERM provided a solid foundation for teachers' and students' progress in literacy  knowledge and instruction.    In June of 2018, the data was analyzed by the SLT and our Rigorous Instruction CEP Team to determine goal  attainment. Even with the supports from ERM and i-Ready, we did not meet our overall school goal of 60% of  students reading on or above grade level by June 2018. We currently have 53.4% of students reading on or above  grade level, 11.08% reading one level below, 6.38% reading two levels below, and 27.6% of students reading more  than two levels below grade level. The SLT and Rigorous Instruction CEP Team determined that although ERM seemed  to be helpful for our Tier II and III students, our Tier I students lacked the foundational skills necessary to improve  their reading levels. As such, P.S. 306 has committed to implementing EL Education, a blended-literacy program in all  grades K-2 for the 2018-19 school year (grades 3-5 implemented EL Education during the 2017-18 school year). EL  Education for grades K-2 includes a one-hour foundational skills block dedicated to phonics and phonemic awareness  instruction. Since our data showed that grades 1 and 2 seemed to struggle the most in improving reading levels, the  foundational skills block in the EL Education program will benefit these students. In order to close the achievement  gap, the incoming grade 3 students will also receive the skills block instruction. In addition, our 3-5 grade students  show a significant number of students reading below grade level: 56.4% of 3rd grade students are reading below  grade level, 38.4% of 4th grade students are reading below grade level, 44.9% of 5th grade students are reading  below grade level. With our 4th and 5th grade students coming into their second school year with EL Education and  the implementation of the skills block for our 3rd grade students, we hope to see improvements in these numbers  during the 2018-19 school year and have thus adjusted our goal accordingly. The impact of this work will be measured  through Skills Block assessments, literacy content assessments, reading level benchmark assessments, teacher  observations, student discussions, and student work products.   The SLT and Rigorous Instruction CEP Team determined that a goal of improving reading levels did not accurately  capture to academic growth of all students. As such, we changed our goal this year to measure progress in literacy  rather than reading level. Students' progress will be measured and progress monitored by the i-Ready diagnostics for  beginning-of-year, mid-year, and end-of-year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          17      Strengths :   -Providing guided reading professional learning opportunities to staff via professional learning workshops, modeling,  1-on-1 coaching, co-teaching, and inter-visitations.   -Implementing a data driven, guided reading program, literacy centers (K-2), literacy stations (3-5) and utilizing the i- Ready program.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  P.S. 306 has established a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their  teachers and peers. Our teachers consistently develop and maintain classroom environment expectations and  effectively manage student behavior as evidenced by our MOTP data which reports that out of 103 observations, only  2 individual observations received a Developing in Danielson Framework for Teaching component 2d. Managing  Student Behavior, all other observations received either Effective or Highly Effective in both components of Domain 2  Classroom Environment. In addition, our scores on the NYC School survey reflected highly positive results in the  Supportive Environment domain with 96% positive in the Safety category and 95% positive in the Social-Emotional  category.   In an effort to continue to create a safe and secure environment for our students, as well as to support students’  social-emotional growth, our school has adopted Social-Emotional Learning (SEL), Restorative Practices, Positive  Behavioral Interventions Supports (PBIS), American School Counseling Association (ASCA) aligned school counseling  program, Sanford Harmony Character Education, as well as developed a book of the month program that aligns with  the Sanford Harmony curriculum. The purpose of these components is to target specific areas of intervention,  enhance social-emotional competencies and provide a holistic approach to enhancing our school culture and climate.  In addition, our staff will continue to model professional P.A.C.K. values (Positive, Accountable, Collaborative, and  Kind), and with the use of school-wide data track and monitor progress in reducing behavioral incidents, the New York  City Academy for Discovery will continue to be a safe place for all students. In addition to the aforementioned  qualitative data, impact of this work measured by student-to-student problem-solving conversations mediated by  teachers or the school counselor.   According to OORS data we did not met our goal for the 2017-18 school year of a 5% decrease in all levels of recess  incidents. For the 2016-17 school year, there was a total of 61 level 1-5 recess incidents; during the 2017-18 school  year there was a total of 68 level 1-5 recess incidents. Therefore, we had an 11% increase.    Our teachers and staff received a booster session on reporting incidents accurately during March 2017. Following this  booster session, we saw an increase in the reporting of overall incidents. The biggest spike in incidents began  occurring in March 2017 following the booster session. Teachers and staff are now reporting all incidents and  accidents in an accurate and timely manner. This is likely the reasoning for the 11% increase that occurred during the  2017-18 school year.   We are hoping to see the 5% decrease (4 incidents) during the 2018-19 school year, as by June 2019 we will have two  full years of accurately reported OORS data to compare. We will continue to work on decreasing all student incidents  occurring in our school with a specific focus placed on decreasing all levels of incidents occurring during the recess  periods.

The teachers of P.S. 306 work collaboratively throughout the year in planning, instruction, RtI, data analysis, and  professional learning. Our NYC School Survey results for 2017-18 school year, boast an overall score of 4.04 for  Collaborative Teachers, which is +0.11 greater than the district average and +0.25 greater than the city average.  Throughout the year, teachers work together to improve their practice by engaging in supervisor-directed or self- directed intervisitations, which helped to solidify 100% of teachers scoring Effective or Highly Effective on their last  observation of the 2017-18 school year on the Danielson Framework for Teaching component 3c. Engaging Students  in Learning.    According to the NYSED, our math scores on the math State exams decreased from 45% of students scoring proficient  in 2015-16 to 42% of students scoring proficient in 2016-17. In an effort to increase student math proficiency for the  2017-18 school year, P.S. 306 implemented multiple instructional and professional learning supports for teachers and  students. Licenses were purchased for all students in K-5 for the i-Ready math, a program which provides  individualized instruction and a valid and reliable growth measure through an online program. Students had access to  i-Ready during math centers and stations to support direct instruction and had online access at home. P.S. 306 also  partnered with Metamorphosis, a strategic, systemic approach to improving student learning, focused on the  instructional core: planning, implementing, reflecting on, and refining lessons based on evidence of student learning  or lack thereof. Teachers were provided with year-long mentoring, 1-on-1 coaching, co-teaching, modeling, and  intervisitations from the Metamorphosis consultant. Both i-Ready and Metamorphosis provided a solid foundation for  teachers' and students' progress in math instruction and content knowledge. Of the 179 students in grades 3-5 who  completed both the beginning-of-year and end-of-year i-Ready math diagnostic, 98 students met the growth target.  The growth target is the scale score increase that shows that a student has made one year of growth.   -Third Grade - 36/55 (65%) students met their growth target   -Fourth Grade - 34/59 (58%) students met their growth target   -Fifth Grade - 28/65 (43%) students met their growth target   Based on this data, the SLT and our Collaborative Teachers CEP Team determined that during the 2018-19 school year,  we can increase our goal to 60% of students will meet the growth target for math.   Strengths :   -Teachers work collaboratively during common planning to revise and refine curriculum based on effectively  developed inquiry practices.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      -Teachers engage in administrator and teacher-directed inter-visitations to observe best practices in math instruction  and implement these practices into their daily math instruction.   Needs :    -Provide faculty with professional learning on how to design and facilitate data driven guided math lessons, identify  students who will benefit from RtI and progress monitoring.   -Strengthen students’ fact fluency.   Priority Need :   -Our priority need it to enhance our faculty's content knowledge in mathematics in order to deliver data driven math  lessons to increase student proficiency in mathematics content.

Administrators and teachers at PS 306 engage in a unique professional learning experience with each observation,  formal or informal. After the observation, teachers reflect on their practice and rate themselves using the Danielson  Framework for Teaching. During the post-observation conference, the administrator and teacher engage in a  professional conversation discussing rubric-based evidence from the lesson to identify strengths and next steps to  improve practice. Both parties come to a shared understanding of the rating and next steps for each component.  Through this process, teacher ratings have increased since the Framework's inception during the 2013-14 school year.  During the 2017-18 school year, teachers engaged in both supervisor-directed and self-led intervisitations to improve  individual areas of focus. The impact of this work, quantitatively measured by the Danielson Framework for Teaching  as described below, has not only been made evident through this measure, but in teachers' capacity to engage in self- reflective practices to improve their teaching. It has also increased teachers' ability to foster student agency through  discussions, self and peer assessment practices, and student work products.   Teacher ratings under the Danielson Framework for Teaching component 3c Engaging Students in Learning have been  steadily increasing since the inception of the observation process, intervisitations, and professional learning from the  TDC. In June 2015, 82.9% of ratings for component 3c were rated either effective or highly effective. By June 2016,  84% of observations for component 3c. had been rated effective or highly effective. By June 2017, 90% of teachers  were rated either effective or highly effective on their final observation. By June 2018, 100% of teachers were rated  effective or highly effective on their final observation.   Strengths :   -Administrators conduct observations; and teachers and administrators engage in meaningful post-observation  conferences, discussing rubric-based evidence from the lesson with teachers providing next steps to improve practice.   -Teachers implement suggestions from post-observation conferences; engage in common planning with teams to  revise lesson plans.   -Professional learning workshops, modeling, administrator and teacher-led inter-visitations, and targeted professional  learning workshops for new teachers.   Needs:   -Student initiation of higher order thinking questions, extension of discussions, and challenging each others' thinking.   -Student reflection at the end of a lesson to consolidate their thinking and understanding.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      -Activities and assignments require student thinking that emphasizes depth over breadth and encourages students to  explain their thinking.

At the end of the 2015-16 school year, we piloted the Student Led Conferences (SLC) initiative in our fifth grade and  pre-kindergarten. Through SLC, which occur during Parent Teacher Conferences, students took ownership of their  learning, analyzed their strengths and areas for improvement and had the opportunity to share that data with their  parents. SLCs are a unique way to increase parent engagement in their child's education. With an overwhelming  response from parents, teachers, and students, we implemented SLC in all grades for the 2016-17 school year. The  impact of this work is evident in the rich conversations between students and parents, where students, in all grades K- 5, eloquently describe how they developed and achieved their goals or identified next steps for content area work  products.   After reviewing the parent attendance data for SLC for November 2017 and March 2017, we discovered that 84% of  our parent community attended the November 2017 SLC and 82% attended the March SLC. We continue to seek to  increase parent attendance during SLC for the 2018-19 school year.       Strengths:   -Implementing Student Led Conferences in all grades PK-5 for November, March, and May for the 2018-19 school year   Needs:   -Increase parent attendance during SLC.   -Provide translation services during SLC.   -Provide parents with the opportunity to attend SLC during Parent Engagement time on Tuesdays, before or after SLC,  or at another time that works best for them.   Priority Need:   -Our priority need is to encourage parents to take an active role in their child's education by participating in SLC, in  order for them to understand their child's areas of celebration and focus.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  All of our staff members are highly qualified and certified to teach in their appointed positions. When recruiting  teachers for vacancy positions, a team,comprised of administration and teaching staff, interviews and selects teachers  with certifications that match our vacancies. If there is a change in teaching assignment, we ascertain that the teacher  takes appropriate coursework to meet the certification requirements for their new certification area.   All staff is provided with weekly professional learning based on need, which is either self-, team-, or school-directed.  Staff is also encouraged to seek off-site professional learning, view webinars, and facilitate professional learning for  their peers. Teachers are informed of leadership opportunities through the DOE and are supported in their  professional growth.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Professional learning for school leaders, teachers, and paraprofessionals is ongoing and is based on the needs of staff  members. Professional learning is chosen and designed according to self, grade, and school identified needs and  observed needs as measured by the Danielson Framework for Teaching observations conducted by school leaders.  We have established a professional learning committee made up of administrators, teachers and paraprofessionals.  The professional learning committee meets on a monthly basis to discuss the needs of the staff and make  recommendations to the principal about professional learning that is needed. Professional learning is then offered at  a school-wide level during the contractual professional learning times after dismissal on Mondays. If the sessions that  are being offered do not meet the needs of individual teachers or grade levels, those teachers and grades have the  option to plan for self-guided professional learning opportunities that target various content areas or individual  needs. Professional learning is led by school leaders, team leaders, and/or teachers.        Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  In May of 2018, the incoming Pre-K families were provided with a Welcome to Pre-Kindergarten Workshop. The  workshop was presented by the PK team, who provided families with an overview of PK. This year's PK students  practiced eating lunch in the cafeteria and also visited the kindergarten classrooms to help prepare them for the new  environment. At the beginning of the 2018-2019 school-year, we will invite our K parents to a Welcome to  Kindergarten Workshop during Family Night, facilitated by the kindergarten teachers. Parents will have the  opportunity to tour the school and visit kindergarten classrooms and meet their child’s classroom and cluster  teachers. During the meeting, teachers will review the school's mission, vision and instructional focus, discuss the  Family Handbook, curriculum and academic expectations, as well as explain classroom and school procedures such as  homework, school trips, lunch program, and behavior expectations. Parents will be able to meet other staff members  including the principal, assistant principal, parent coordinator, cluster teachers, IEP teacher, and school counselor.    The Assessment Team (school psychologist, social worker, family worker, IEP teacher), in collaboration with school  leaders, identifies incoming ‘Turning 5’ students to ensure that the school is prepared to meet the needs of each  individual student according to their Individualized Education Plan (IEP). The school works to provide each student  with their Least Restrictive Setting, SETSS, and related services (OT, PT, counseling).        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Our school uses multiple assessment tools throughout the school year to assess student performance and progress in  a given area.    Assessments and measures used by the school are EL Education blended literacy reading and writing assessments,  Social Studies, and Science tasks, Fountas & Pinnell Benchmark System, i-Ready ELA/math diagnostics, Go Math  chapter tests and tasks, and Passport to Social Studies end-of-unit assessments. The decision to use these programs  was made collaboratively by school leaders and teachers based on research and effectiveness through use.  Professional learning is provided for all staff on how to administer the assessments, score the assessments, analyze  the data, and create action plans to address the needs as implicated by the data.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74       4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75        Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of this policy  is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school. P.S.306, in compliance  with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their  children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as  trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community. P.S. 306 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   -providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   -providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   -fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   -providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   -sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77      -providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       Our Title I Parent Involvement Policy was designed by the Parents Association and School Leadership Team. In order  to increase and improve parent involvement/engagement and school quality we will:   Parental Involvement and School Quality   -actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   -engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly  to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   -ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   -support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The  Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   -conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    -provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   -host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118,    and other applicable sections under the ESSA;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78      -schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or  evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   -translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    -conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   -holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   -hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   -encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   -supporting or hosting Family Day events;   -establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   -encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   -providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their children’s  progress;   -developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   -providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, and  to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)   P.S. 306, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA),  is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

In order to  meet the needs of these 3 groups of students, we have decided to implement an ELL before- school program that will provide sheltered ENL instruction that is specific to the needs of our 3  identified ELL subgroups. An invitaiton letter will be sent out to students and a schedule has  been established as to which students will be in attendance.  Our ELL before-school program  will feature small-group instruction at a 10:1 ratio. Students in the 2-5 language development  subgroups will receive instruction that will be organized around Imagine Learning and Rosetta  Stone, which includes phonics, reading comprehension and vocabulary. Building the  instructional program for this subgroup around these computer programs will allow our ELL  students to build the English vocabulary that they are lacking, and will allow students to practice  communication skills through meaningful content. The before-school program will also provide  scaffolding for the material that the ELL students encounter in their mainstream classes. Our  before-school program will meet on Thursday and Friday from 7:30 to 8:15 AM and will be  taught by  certified ENL teachers. The program will run from October 2018 through June 2019.  Depending on enrollment, we hope to service 30 ELL students in grades 2-5.

During weekly 45 minute common planning times and bi-monthly inquiry sessions,  ELL providers and team leaders collaborate to support ELL students by coming up with ideas  and strategies to modify curricula, lessons and assessments.  In order to support ELLs and former  ELLs, SIFE long term ELLs and ELLS with IEPs, ENL teachers attend  in-service  professional  development from September to June offered by DELLS .  The topics include: Meeting the needs  of Diverse learners in grades K-5, Addressing the Vocabulary needs of ELLs, Instructional  Practices  for ELLs Promoting Quality Educational Opportunities for ELLs, CCLS for ELLs in  Math and ELA, and Blueprint for ELLs success. These workshops consist of planning sessions  targeting specific instructional objectives and outlining the activities for each session. The ELL  teachers attending network professional development workshops will turn key  to the staff during  Monday professional learning time from 2:45- 3:55 P.M.  Teachers plan collaboratively weekly  during common preps, analyze student work, and discuss student progress and performance, as  well as sharing best practices in order to better prepare the students for the NYS exams. Staff  will also be invited to attend an in-house professional development provided by CITE. Teachers  also participate in off-site ELL PL provided by the district.

Our parents and guardians are notified of these events  by our monthly school calendar, school wide and grade level newsletters, Class Dojo, our school  website and Twitter account, phone call reminders and flyers with a tear off section to gauge  how many parents will attend.  ELL professional development will be made available to all  parents of ELLs once every semester. Parents will be presented with materials, resources and  strategies that they may use to help their children at home. Our two ENL teachers, along with our  Parent Coordinator and grade level team leaders will design and deliver  these workshops  throughout the school year.  Topics of the workshops include Literacy and Math strategies for  ELLs, where teaching strategies will be modeled for parents, giving them the opportunity to  interact with their children and practice those strategies during the demonstration. Other topics  will include NYSESLAT and test prep strategies, homework help, guidance workshop, and using  technology. These workshops will reinforce  instructional strategies that the teachers have been  using to support the children in their classrooms. Workshops will be offered in English and in  Spanish to encourage participation; specific workshops targeting Spanish speaking parents will  also be offered in order to encourage our largest language constituency of ELL parents to attend.  Translation services will also be available should any parent/guardian require them. The dates for  the parent workshops are as follows: September 13, 2018, November 14, 2018, March 13, 2019  and May 15, 2019 to coincide with parent teacher conferences.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          85   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data, Skills Block Assessments, Fountas and Pinnell running records, ELA MOSL  Performance Task data, i-Ready ELA and Math assessments,  weekly conference logs during guided groups, RLAT/RNMR/EDAT  reports and common core standards as an indicator of student literacy skills.  Our instructional cabinet, made up of grade  leaders, ENL teachers, IEP teachers, and content area members, will analyze the data and trends across the year. Data based  on last year's Fountas and Pinnell and the year prior indicated that ELLs and general education students needed growth in  vocabulary and fluency. Those areas were supplemented by the ENL staff by using context and comprehension strategies and  introducing grammar components based on language level.  This year’s increase in ELL population size within grades K-2  indicate a need for guided reading and guided writing to build students' skills and prepare them for more challenging   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          88      classwork and exams. An analysis of the ELA MOSL data showed us that our ELL students needed more prior knowledge and  background knowledge in order to complete the reading and written tasks.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The structures that are in place to support this effort include increasing time on task for work assigned, simplifying instructions  for the task, modeling skills and providing continual practice on concepts that are not clear to the students as well as using  more hands on and visual materials. The ENL teachers also provide small group assessment accommodations for these  formative or curriculum-embedded assessments.  ENL teachers provide small group instruction during ELA using EL Education  blended-literacy program.  During this time, ENL teachers co-teach or parallel teach, providing students with content-rich  literacy instruction or foundational skills, in small group or 1-on-1 instruction. In addition to opportunities to engage in  research-based, web-based programs such as i-Ready and Imagine Learning.  We plan to continue using data to inform  instructional goals within the ENL program based on incoming NYSITELL data, EL Education Skills Block assessment data,  Fountas and Pinnell data, Imagine Learning, and i-Ready to use this data to inform instruction across all content areas.  Specifically, professional development has been utilized to insure that this information is being used to target instruction and  goal setting within the ENL program and also within the schools core classroom curriculum.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our school uses EL Education mid-unit and end-of-unit assessments, Skills Block BOY, MOY and EOY assessments, Fountas and  Pinnell benchmark, MOSL, Go Math assessment data, i-Ready ELA and Math, and Imagine Learning to determine the growth of  student achievement in these programs, which we use as baseline/benchmarks and use to measure progress and identify  areas of need. Classroom teachers and ENL teachers collaborate and co-teach which builds upon the success of the students.  We also use NYSESLAT scores from the current school year to determine how much improvement our ELL's made during this  year in listening, reading, writing and speaking to inform our instruction for the upcoming school year.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered, students are placed in small groups based on their needs as a result of their  assessment scores. Whole group instruction is also differentiated based on student needs. We focus on targeted strategies for  these students which include daily guided ELA and math groups. Based on the UDL framework, teachers collaborate to revise  unit and lesson plans and curriculum maps. Teachers also meet for vertical and horizontal inquiry meetings to identify progress  and areas of need. ENL teachers attend weekly teacher team meetings to share strategies with classroom teachers. Students  have access to a variety of computer-based programs which include i-Ready ELA and Math and Imagine Learning which also  target their areas of need and provide the teacher with data to inform guided instruction. Students are also given  differentiated classwork and homework assignments to target their needs. RtI is provided in cycles to students identified by  the classroom teacher and RtI team. During RtI, teachers use the data gathered to address the specific needs of students.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   We begin by examining the number of years the ELL student has been in the ENL program as well as how the social and  academic backgrounds have an impact on their academic achievement.  We then examine the Tier I instruction that is  delivered as well as formative assessments, which include Fountas and Pinnell running records, i-Ready data, EL Education  Skills Block data, Imagine Learning data, and prior years' State ELA, Math, and NYSESLAT scores. Based on these observations  and analysis of data, we determine the course of intervention in order to meet the students' needs. Within the classroom,  students are grouped according to their reading and math levels, so teachers can work with small groups to deliver intensive,  tailored instruction. One area for ELL Instruction is a focus on promoting language and literacy development. This will be  accomplished by building and expanding students' existing oral language competencies. We will build background knowledge,  engage in close interactive read alouds and collaborative discussions and debate, role play, sentence and language frames,  intensive vocabulary instruction, modeling and visuals and reteaching when necessary. We will also provide reading  comprehension instruction by building background knowledge and highlighting key vocabulary. Tier II interventions will be  provided with ENL teachers and other specialists who will work with the smaller groups of ELLs based on areas of need. Tier III  interventions will take place outside of the classroom with ENL teachers and other specialists who work 1:1 or 1:3 groupings.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          89         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Patterns in Proficiency Levels Our NYSESLAT data shows that the majority of our Entering to Transitioning ELL students are  from early childhood grades K-2. By 3rd grade, a vast majority of our students reach the Expanding proficiency on the  NYSESLAT or test out at the Commanding level. The 2018 NYSESLAT scores revealed the largest groups of students that scored  Commanding were in grades 3-5. Many students increased in levels from emerging to transitioning and transitioning to  expanding.  NYSITELL data for this year reveals that we have a wide range of needs at our school. This will require strategic  differentiation using the stand-alone and/or integrated model as well as designing classes that have dually-certified teachers in  common branch and TESOL.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Our school uses G-Suite on which all data is made available for all teachers and staff.  In addition, during Monday Professional  Learning, the data is reviewed with the whole school to discuss what adjustments need to be made. It is analyzed by the ENL  teachers and members of the LAP team and referenced during strategic planning with classroom and content area teachers.  This data is also reviewed when the ENL teachers attend the weekly teacher team meetings. Adjustments may include changes  in student grouping, strategies targeted to the needs of the student/s, implementation of multiple entry points, and AIS/RTI  interventions.  The information we acquire from this data will help the school to focus on specific skills and write goals that will  meet the needs of our ELLs.               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   PS 306 has a stand alone and integrated ENL program  which delivers content to our students according to the  mandated minutes they receive from NYSESLAT scores. Our certified ENL teachers provide instruction to the 79 ELLs  that are in our building. Standalone ENL instruction is used to develop the English language skills so that the students  can succeed in core content courses, which are also delivered by one of our three certified ENL teachers. The  integrated ENL model is instruction used to build English language skills through content area instruction. The content  delivered to the students is by a dually certified teacher (ENL and a content area) or co-teaching by a certified ENL  teacher and a certified content area teacher. The ENL teachers implement ENL methodologies that support language  development in listening, speaking, reading and writing for our K-5 students. ELL students are regrouped in the ENL  classroom at designated times based on their proficiency levels. The ENL teachers work in partnership with the  classroom teachers to support content specific ENL instruction that aligns with classroom activities and curriculum  goals.  English Language Learners in each grade are grouped heterogeneously to increase productivity. The continued  collaboration of the classroom teacher and ENL teachers makes supporting English Language Learners with a range of  ability possible.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          90      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?           As per CR Part 154, mandated instructional unit requirements for ELLs differ by levels according to each ELL student based on  language level: Entering and Emerging ELLs receive 360 minutes a week of ENL instruction broken down into eight  periods.  Transitioning and Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction broken down into four periods.  Commanding ELLs receive 90 minutes of integrated instruction. Student language levels are based on NYSITELL/NYSESLAT  results and designated as Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding within grades K-5. Teachers who are  dually certified in ENL have the majority of ELLs in their classes creating a more productive environment and delivering  continuous ENL support for the ELL students.  ENL instruction is a culmination of methodologies used to increase the four areas of proficiency: speaking, listening, reading  and writing. Each student is seen as an individual with an individual history and style for language acquisition. The students are  addressed in a variety of models in order to enrich their experience. In addition, instruction is conducted using heavy  scaffolding and differentiation within both literacy and content specific areas to ensure greater comprehension. Intervention  in the core content areas such as math, science, and social studies are supplemented by the ENL and classroom teacher. ELL  students also have access to all services offered in the school.  Students are provided grade-level as well as ENL proficiency  appropriate materials.  Instructional materials are as diversified as our curriculum and include a variety of print and  technological resources used to target comprehension from all angles, providing multiple entry points.  Print resources  includes high frequency readers from our EL Education Skills Block literacy program to increase foundational skills and  fluency.  Leveled libraries include bilingual books and picture dictionaries.  Our technological resources include Imagine  Learning and Rosetta Stone software, Smart Boards, a variety of learning websites and listening centers. In addition, students  are given the opportunity to converse with one another in meaningful and realistic activities using accountable talk and  discussion rubrics, in order to foster both academic growth and self-confidence.  All students have access to technology within  the classroom. Each classroom in grades 3-5 has a laptop cart supplying the students with a 1:3 ratio of technology to student.  Grades K-2 have access to a large laptop cart which is shared amongst the grades maintaining the  1:3 ratio.  All students utilize  the laptops and desktop computers during centers as well as during literacy and content area instruction.   Explicit ELA InstructionClassroom teachers and the ENL teachers collaborate weekly during Teacher Team Meetings to ensure  that the specific needs of each ELL student is being addressed and met. Schedules are coordinated with classroom teacher  support to insure that instructional time adhere to mandated minutes allocated to each ELL student based on language level.  Teachers who are dually certified in ENL have the majority of ELLs in their class creating a more productive environment and  delivering continuous ENL support for all ELL students.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   To deliver instruction in content areas, ENL teachers provide both stand-alone and integrated instruction. Our students come  from varied backgrounds and therefore receive content area instruction in core academic areas in English. When necessary,  Google technology for language translations are utilized during content instruction.  In addition, language support is provided  by qualified staff and/or translators in native languages. The ENL teachers provide support and instruction within the confines  and context of the general education classroom through collaboration with the classroom teacher. Together they identify skills  and concepts appropriate to the grade level, language proficiency level and learning styles of the ELL students. The ENL  teacher scaffolds the concepts, in English, taught by the general education teacher to the ELL students. Our ENL program  focuses on developing and teaching students to use academic language skills. Both the teacher and students use academic  language to communicate, analyze and explain content. The teacher models the appropriate language and creates  opportunities for using academic language. At P.S. 306, ELLs are taught how and when to use learning strategies. Students are  shown when and how to use these strategies (teacher modeling) and are given opportunities to practice it.  Other  methodologies used are to repeat concepts in different ways to address multiple learning styles. Our program also focuses on  differentiated instruction aligned with the CCLS in which materials are presented using multiple entry points, in smaller  segments, assignments are expanded over a longer period of time, and instruction is provided within small group settings.  Assessment activities are integrated into the program to help gage students’ progress in acquiring language.                         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          91      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   When students register for our school, we determine if they are a transfer student from another DOE school or if they are new  to the city school system.  If the student is a transfer, we review his/her ATS profile to determine ELL status and implement the  appropriate program.  For new admits, the parent will complete a Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS), to  identify the home language. The ENL teachers then interview the student and parent.  They ensure that students are  appropriately evaluated in their native language by administering the NYSITELL and Spanish LAB to native Spanish speaking  students.  Students in the State testing grades (3-5) have the opportunity to take the NYS math, and NYS Science exams (4th  grade) in their native language, and students with a different native language are provided a translator. Teachers also provide  translated assessments when and if possible to the ELL students.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       Plans for SIFENot applicable  Plans for NewcomersWe welcome newcomers by placing them in a setting that is nurturing and allows them to have a  successful transition in the academic environment.  ELLs in school less than 3 years are seen for eight 45-minute periods per  week. This gives each newcomer 360 minutes in the ENL classroom where he/she receives intensive English language  instruction. This allows students to adjust to their new surroundings and enables them to function effectively in their regular  classroom. Students are grouped appropriately with other students who are not only on their proficiency level but students  who are able to encourage and support them in acquiring the English language. Newcomers are also paired with students that  are fluent in their native language. In every case, once a student arrives at the school, initial assessments will be given  promptly and appropriately used to ascertain ability. ENL teachers and classroom teachers will collaborate throughout the  year to ensure that the special needs of each ELL student is being addressed and met in the general education classroom  setting. Classroom content/instruction for  ELA is modified and scaffolded by the ENL teacher to make sure that it is accessible  for our ELL’s regardless of their language proficiency level or years of experience.   Plans for Long Term ELLsOnce students are identified as the long term ELLs, testing data from the prior year is analyzed to  develop a plan for enrichment based on the factors that impact that student’s achievement. Students who have not met  adequate performance in listening, speaking, reading, and writing based on last year's NYSESLAT exam will benefit from  additional support in conjunction with the collaborative ENL model initiated this year during ENL in class enrichment periods  lasting 45-90 minutes depending on mandates.  Such support consists of the ENL and classroom teacher planning and  collaborating using an EL Education blended-literacy program and Go Math curriculum, Common Core Learning Standards  utilization, tracking of reading levels using Fountas and Pinnell running records, EL Education Skills block data, and analysis of  electronic data tracking to observe trends and develop individualized students goals for literacy and ENL. We also utilitze RtI to  develop any weaknesses in the areas of phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency and oral expression, written ideas,  conventions, organization, voice, word choice, sentence fluency, and presentation. Computer based programs which include  Imagine Learning and i-Ready ELA and math software targets literacy specifically for ENL students, literacy through content  area instruction during cluster periods, and after-school and Title III programming to target literacy goals. Long term ELLs may  also be discussed with the IEP teacher and  Pupil Personnel Team to identify if other supports are needed.    Students who are former ELLs receive continuing support throughout the school year. ENL teachers continue to help classroom  teachers with strategies and planning. Former ELLs can receive up to double time on state exams for up to two years as well as  bilingual glossaries, separate location, and oral translation for languages other than Spanish. These supports allow former ELLs  to be more successful on exams and in their classroom setting.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          92      ELL-SWDs continue to have regular involvement in all curricular and extracurricular activities within our school and are  supported by a variety of meaningful and diverse programming including visuals arts, science, math, social studies, dramatic  arts, physical education, character education and after-school programming. Instructional strategies such as visuals, modeling  and small group interventions in the core content areas such as math, science, and social studies are supplemented by  collaboration amongst ENL and classroom teachers to isolate skills and develop strategies based on the standards within each  area and by grade, such as common core standards. There are many instructional strategies and grade-level materials that  teachers use to provide multiple entry points for ELL- SWDs in academic content area support using hands on tactile  manipulatives. Our activities are delivered via SMART panels/boards where students can interact with the lesson. ELL-SWDs  students also have access to all services offered in the school setting such as counseling, occupational therapy, physical  therapy, and speech services.                     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  In the curricular instructional and scheduling flexibility of our school, we meet the diverse needs of our ELL-SWD's by  conferencing with service providers and parents to better understand the needs of our students. Many of ELL-SWDs attend  after-school programs for ELA and math that focus on specific skills and strategies. In addition, our school is taking initiatives to  make sure that ENL teachers become part of the IEP service team (PPT and SIT) and have access to SESIS to ensure that ELL  students with disabilities receive mandated services developed during annual review meetings. Students may use the test  modifications and accommodations as detailed on their IEP when taking the NYSESLAT.  By being part of the process, ENL  teachers will be able to navigate IEPs and recognize which sections indicate specific services and goals related to those  services. By being a part of the IEP team, ENL teachers will be able to coordinate their schedules with other service providers  to ensure that there are no conflicting schedules that disrupt the services mandated to our ELLs with IEPs.                          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Intervention in the core content areas such as ELA, math, science, and social studies are supplemented by the ENL and  classroom teacher in collaboration to isolate skills and develop strategies based on the standards within each area and by  grade. This year our school will be using Imagine Learning, a computer based acceleration program following the RtI model. It  focuses on target intervention for ELLs in the areas of phonological awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, comprehension  and structural analysis. ENL students will be utilizing Imagine Learning 30 min per day 3-4 times per week. This program is  structured to allow ELLs to transition from their native language to English as they become proficient within the  program.  Students also have access to i-Ready ELA and math computer programs. These programs can be accessed both at  home and at school. In addition,  teachers will be providing RtI intervention to the ELLs' and former ELLs that are not  progressing at an appropriate rate in a Tier I setting. This year, our school has implemented the EL Education blended literacy  program in grades K-5. This program allows for coherence across the grades and exposes our ENL students to strategies and  skills they will encounter throughout their academic career. Throughout our ELA block, students are engaged challenging  content which seeks to increase student engagement and elevate and expand student achievement by matering skills,  developing character, and producing high quality work.   Through this framework,  teachers provide Tier 2 instructions that  meet the specific needs of our ENL population. In the upper grades, Algebra For All has been implemented in our math block  utilizing the upside-down teaching model, engaging students in a productive struggle in mathematics. This program allows for  our ENL students to successfully analyze math problems through discussion and exploration.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      This year our school will use EL Education blended literacy program, Go Math curriculum, Amplify Science and in grades 3- 5,  Algebra For All. ELL students in grades K-2 also receive foundational skills through the EL Education curriculum Skills Block.  This program allows for ELL students to receive targeted instruction on phonics skills. Each of these programs provides  scaffolding and support for ELLs as well as assessments. i-Ready ELA and math will provide ongoing data and lessons to target  specific instruction for our ELL students. Students will also have a technology period and a drama period.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          93      No programs will be discontinued this year.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs, general and Special Education students, are afforded equal access to all school programs. They are invited to  participate in all after-school programs offered on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:35 to 4:00 p.m., as well as the Greater  Ridgewood Youth Council after school program which runs everyday from 2:35-5:30 p.m. ELLs participate in all other school  related programs such as assemblies, enrichment clubs, theater productions, and class trips.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We use the following instructional materials to support ELLs: EL Education, Go Math, Passport to Social Studies, Amplify  Science, and Language Power.  EL Education and Go Math offer scaffolding materials and differentiated activities for ELLs.  Glossaries, literacy leveled books, bilingual and picture dictionaries, word charts, word walls, pictures and other visuals.  Imagine Learning, Rosetta Stone, i-Ready ELA and Math are utilized to support student learning.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   At this time our school only offers an ENL program. In order to support home language, classroom and ENL teachers utilize  bilingual glossaries and native language libraries as well as pictures, word walls, word charts and other visuals. Teachers also  have online access to all of the curriculum and Reading A-Z for ELLs.  Student assessments and class work are translated when  possible.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All services and resources correspond to ELLs ages and grade levels. The ENL teachers plan their schedule based on student  proficiency levels. Students are programmed into STARS to ensure that students receive their mandated time according to CR  Part 154-2.  Newcomers in each grade are programmed with their mandated stand-alone time.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Activities for newly enrolled ELLs When parents/guardians register their children, pedagogical staff members, including the  ENL teachers, meet with them to describe the different programs available to English Language Learners. Some of these  parents/guardians and students also meet with our School Counselor, Social Worker, School Psychologist, ENL specialists  and/or Parent Coordinator to address specific social, emotional, and or academic needs during the registration process.  Additionally, on a monthly basis, the Parent Coordinator offers various parent workshops on different topics such as nutrition,  fire safety, grade-wide expectations and school policies.  ENL teachers also offer various workshops for parents such as  strategies to help with reading, math and homework.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A        18.

Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          94         d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development is an ongoing process at P.S. 306. Teacher teams meet bi-monthly for data inquiry to examine  student work, discuss student progress, problems of practice, and determine next steps to implement. General education  teachers, special education teachers and ENL teachers meet for weekly planning sessions to discuss strategies that are most  effective in supporting ELLs and share their experiences. In addition, key information about ELLs is shared to strengthen and  support student learning. Our teachers will receive the required amount of professional development hours (15% total hours  ELL specific PD for all teachers and 50% total hours ELL specific PD for Bilingual Education and ENL teachers). This professional  development schedule will address ENL strategies and will be conducted by the ENL licensed school teachers and  administration.  These workshops are given to general education teachers, paraprofessionals, and special education  teachers.  All teachers, including ENL teachers, engage in school-led and self-led intervisitations in order to observe best  practices from model classrooms throughout the school on various grade levels.  In addition, professional development is  conducted at the beginning of each school year to analyze trends in NYSESLAT data and target goal setting initiatives for  strategic instruction. Specifically, these workshops focus on the score conversion results that specify the range of ability within  speaking, listening, reading and writing designated to each ENL student.  Professional development is tracked sign in sheet to  validate their presence at the workshop and the professional learning calendar. A series of professional development has/will  be offered to the teachers in a series of workshops on Monday afternoons- dates TBD- which will include topics such as ELL  instructional strategies, teachers creating materials for the ELL classroom, ELL strategies and centers for families, and  preparing for the NYSESLAT. These will be available to all staff.ENL teachers will receive ongoing training at the school, as well  as at the network, on how to effectively teach to the Common Core Learning Standards as well as strategies and best practices  for ELL students. Our professional development will include topics that will help teachers and other staff who work with ELLs to  help improve teachers' instructional practices, student agency practices, English language acquisition skills, and include  multiple entry points for ELLs.. ENL teachers and other consultants will provide workshops and turnkey information to help  teachers understand mandates for ELLs. Topics include but are not limited to — Background Knowledge & Brainstorming  Activity, Supporting ELLs in Mathematics Classroom, Scaffolding the Teaching of Reading, Vocabulary Building, NYSESLAT  training, Using Technology to Improve English Language Development, and Using Data to Plan Instruction. The workshops will  follow a format of giving information, i.e. what the research states; a discussion--which includes an activity; and then a  question and answer time.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our teachers will receive the required amount of professional development hours (15% total hours ELL specific PD for all  teachers and 50% total hours ELL specific PD for Bilingual Education and ENL  teachers). This professional development  schedule will address ENL strategies and will be conducted by the ENL licensed school teachers and administration.  These  workshops are given to general education teachers, paraprofessionals, and special education teachers. ENL teachers will  attend district professional learning opportunities throughout the year and turn-key the information to the staff during  Monday PL time.  Outside educational consultants will be scheduled to our school to provide professional learning to the  staff. In addition, professional development is conducted at the beginning of each school year to analyze trends in NYSESLAT  data and target goal setting initiatives for strategic instruction. Specifically, these workshops focus on the score conversion  results that specify the range of ability within speaking, listening, reading and writing designated to each ENL student. Teachers  learn a variety of ENL methods that develop the cognitive, academic and content specific English language skills necessary for   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          95         ELLs in the classroom. The ENL teachers provide staff development as part of the Title III plan to ensure that monolingual  teachers are able to deliver instruction to our ELLs.

Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Schools must individually meet with the parents or guardians at least once a year, in addition to parent-teacher conferences,  initial parent orientations, and other scheduled meetings provided for parents or guardians to discuss the goals of the program  and their child's  language development progress, their child's English language proficiency results based on the NYSESLAT and  language development needs in all content areas. Parents will receive their child's individual NYSESLAT grade test results which  provides them with the proficiency level and explanation of each. The print out also provides the parent with ideas for  supporting their child as well additional resources. This meeting should include school staff necessary to inform the parents  about the child's language development. A translator is provided when needed by assigned staff or by utilizing the translation  services of the DOE. Attendance is recorded and kept on file for all meetings.           2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Our school is committed to developing and implementing a parent policy that fosters a partnership between the home, school  and community. Parents in our school are invited to become an active part of the community, including parents of ELL  students.  This information is made accessible to all families through translated materials sent home and visible throughout the  school. Our Parent Coordinator along with the assistance of parents in the Parent Association translate at these events to  other parents and families. The Translation and Interpretation Unit are also utilized when needed. The  school has also hosted  events such as Bakers and Shakers, Lego Robotics workshops, Grade 3-5 Variety Show, Second Grade musical, and holiday- based parent/child breakfasts focused on parent engagement. Parents are invited on a monthly basis to Family Discovery Day  where they may visit their child's classroom and take part in the learning activities throughout the day. The active participation  of parents at these events allows for open communication and to address and supplement parent concerns and needs  proactively. Letters home and surveys are also utilized to obtain parent input for those who are unable to attend. Our  school utilizes Class Dojo, which provides web-based translation, to keep families informed of upcoming events, important  information about the school's goals, and parents are able to communicate with the teacher via this platform. .

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Cheryl Ann Leone, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The main source of data used to gather the oral and written language preference of parents at PS 306 is the Home  Language Identification Survey (HLIS). The HLIS translated for parents in their preferred language. Every newly  admitted child is reported to the ENL staff and their home language survey is scanned for the language indicators  outlined in the 2016-2017 NYSITELL testing memo. Any HLIS that meets the   testing indicators or remains unclear is then followed up with a one on one interview to clarify or confirm the  results. If there are discrepancies due to an incomplete HLIS, the parent is contacted and interviewed in person  for more information so that the school can accurately communicate with parents in the language they most  prefer.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          99     2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of an emergency, the school will send out a phone message using Blackboard Connect which notifies the  parents in their native language. Translated flyers will also be sent out to notify them. We will also utilize Over-the- Phone Interpretation and Translation Service.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          101         Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      To ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of CR A-663, staff will receive training provided by the  Language Access Coordinator. The Parent Coordinator and the Language Access Coordinator will attend training given  by the Translation and Interpretation Unit which will provide periodic training to parent coordinators and other key  school-based personnel on the language access requirements contained in Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and on  resources available to support these requirements.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Our goal is to ensure timely provision of translated documents and oral interpretation services to parents determined  to be in need of language assistance. When we are unable to provide written translation in-house, we will complete  and submit the Translation Request Form along with the document to be translated one week prior to the date of  distribution of the document. In order to provide oral interpretation services, we have employed a bilingual secretary,  a bilingual parent coordinator, bilingual teachers and bilingual paraprofessionals. When these volunteers are  unavailable, or when we have a need for interpretation in other languages, we will utilize the over-the phone service  at (1-855-249-9103) when the need to contact a parent arises, or when a parent visits the school for a meeting with  the teacher or the administration. When there is a need for on-site interpretation services, we will complete and  submit an Interpretation Request Form as soon as the event has been scheduled. Our Parent Coordinator, Eileen  Otero, will be responsible for ensuring that translation and interpretation services have been arranged. Our ENL  Teachers, Amanda Francavilla and Nazima Ally, will notify parents of their right to translation and interpretation  services. For non-covered languages, we will use the DOE vendor "The Big Word".      Feedback from parents and increased parental involvement will inform P.S. 306 staff of its success in providing  language assistance to parents and the effectiveness of strategies utilized to engage parents in the school community.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services will be obtained from the parent survey as well as  informal feedback from face-to-face meetings with parents. Our school has implemented the feedback to improve  language services by using the NYC School Survey feedback that parents complete. These results are then discussed  with the staff to ensure that parents are receiving the language services they need.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          102               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          103
