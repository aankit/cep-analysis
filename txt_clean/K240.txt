This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.

I.S. 240 Magnet School of STEM is a middle school, (Grades 6-8), that has recently been awarded a Federal Magnet  Grant. As a Magnet School , this funding will assist in offering our students an unrivaled education. Through the use of  state-of-the-art technology, problem-based learning and partnerships that provide theme-based instruction to  students, as well as specialized training to teachers. I.S. 240 students will engage in hands-on-projects that excite and  engage them academically to prepare them for the 21st century.      Our teachers, through the Magnet grant, will receive 5x more the amount of professional development opportunities.  This professional development will assist teachers in creating curriculum technology-based projects that will focus on  our STEM theme, "Building a Better World," while integrating the Engineering Design Process. Our students will learn  to be engineers by working as engineers throughout all content areas. They will explore real-world problems and use  science, technology, math and the engineering design process to solve those problems. They will also engage in an  extended inquiry process where they work together to ask questions and conduct research; they will imagine  solutions to the problems they are investigating; they will plan and create prototypes for their solutions; they will  reflect on and improve upon their prototypes; and finally, they will share the their work with the world.      Research has shown that students who learn this way, and are a part of a diverse community of learners, will out  perform their peers and are therefore, better prepared for college and 21st century STEM sector careers. With help  from our various partners (BEAM, Tequipment, Urban Advantage, Puppetry in Practice at Brooklyn College,  Dare2Dream, East Flatbush Village, Uncharted Play, CAMBA, Dare 2 Dream and more), we will continue to create  exciting opportunities and learning experiences for the children of this community for years to come. With BEAM's  assistance students are able to build, construct and become problem-solvers through real-world interdisciplinary  projects.      I.S. 240 Magnet School of STEM is located in the Midwood neighborhood of South Brooklyn. IS 240 serves 807  students in grades 6–8, from culturally diverse backgrounds.       We at I.S. 240 Magnet School of STEM seek to provide a rigorous, collaborative, thought-provoking STEM-themed  Common Core Learning Standards aligned curriculum. We believe all students can learn and will leave I.S. 240 Magnet  School of STEM as academic, life-long learners. We have implemented "Algebra for All" which provides students 300  minutes a week that enhances their algebra skills through critical thinking.

Our school faces many challenges which are listed:   ● Aligning all content areas to Common Core Learning Standards through common planning and teacher   teams.   ● Meeting AYP by increasing the number of students who meet proficiency in English Language Arts, Mathematics,  Science, and NYSESLAT using systems such as the Data Tracking System to provide targeted STEM-themed instruction.   ● Building capacity for teachers through targeted professional development based on content area   specialty and interest.   ● Using formative assessments on a more granular level in order to improve instruction and student outcome.   ● Curricula which reflect planning to provide all students multiple entry points to the curricula and tasks which  cognitively engage a diversity of learners.   ● Across classrooms, teaching strategies (including questioning and scaffolding in English and/or native   language where appropriate, and routines) inconsistently provide multiple entry points into the curricula   leading to uneven engagement in appropriately challenging tasks and uneven demonstration of higher-   order thinking skills in student work products, including work of ENLs and SWDs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         ● Actionable feedback to students is essential in order to help them improve their work products.

Here at Andries Hudde, we believe parents are our partners in education. We have created a "Parent and Student  Handbook," a Hudde APP and various parent-specific planned events. Parents are actively engaging in STEM-themed  events which showcase our Magnet resources.         In addition, in response to the Quality Review feedback where we were developing in areas of Teacher Rigor and  Teacher Teams.          As we reviewed the item analysis for the New York State CCLS ELA examination, we saw there was a trend that our  lowest one-third (English Language Learners and Students With Disabilities included) students struggled in the areas  of identifying central ideas, use of supporting details, reading comprehension, writing opinion essays and analyzing  text structures. Upon further investigation, our students, based on the New York State CCLS Math examination, our  students struggled with the short response questions where they had to show their work and, if applicable, provide  an explanation.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

According to the major findings of the 2016-2017 Quality Review, school leaders and staff consistently communicate  expectations and offer ongoing feedback. School leaders provide training for those expectations and help families  understand student progress toward those expectations.       However, as per the findings of the Quality Review, we are developing in three key areas:            (1.1) Ensure engaging , rigorous,and coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners and  aligned to Common Core Learning Standards and/or content standards.  (2.2) Develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best that is informed  by the instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligned to the curricula, engaging, and  meets the needs of all learners so that all students produce meaningful work products.  (4.2) Engage in structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes  shared leadership and focuses on improved student learning.   These findings indicate a need for teachers and teacher teams to work more collaboratively to create streamlined  processes designed to implement best practices, structured lessons that produce engaging rigorous instruction and  activities to decrease student boredom/distractedness, etc.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41     to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The I.S. 240 Andries Hudde Magnet School of STEM, in compliance with the  Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   I.S. 240 Magnet School of STEM will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

It is our rationale that this support would be best delivered in small, targeted group instruction.  All 110 English Language Learners will be offered placement in the program. Six classes  will  be formed. Therefore, all of the 120 ELLs will receive direct small group services.    In lowering  the student-to-teacher ratio, it is our belief that our English Language Learners will be given  opportunities to optimize their learning. Targeted groups of children will receive instruction for  Entering level students, students at risk of becoming Long Term ELLs, and those that have  already been designated a Long Term ENL, each will have their particular needs addressed.  Our supplemental Title III program will be grouped as follows: 1) Newcomers, 2) LTE, 3)  Intermediate ELLs. 4) Expanding ELLs.    This program will be supervised by the ENL supervisor at a partial cost to the Title III program.  It is our rationale that students who are supported with the acquisition of the English language  early on will be able to create the strong foundation necessary to become fluent in the English  language.  This group will consist of Newly Enrolled students, and students who are at a  Entering level on the NYSESLAT and/or NYSITELL.  This subgroup will be students of varying  backgrounds and various native languages.  The teacher will utilize a variety of ENL  methodologies within the lessons. These ENL methods include but not limited to: Total Physical  Response (TPR) whereas the teacher proficiently  uses the command system of language to  develop receptive language.  Students respond physically rather than verbally and speech  emerges naturally.  Within this method, speech, visual and physical clues help students  comprehend the second language more effectively. The teacher will use the Natural Approach,  whereas this "acquisition based" method focuses on authentic communication as its primary  goal.  It is characterized as a low-anxiety approach because the focus is on meaning rather than  form.  It is our goal to effectively meet the needs of our beginner group of English Language  Learners. Our supplemental Title III program will provide students at risk of becoming Long  Term ELLs with the instructional support and scaffolds they need in English Language Arts to  prevent them from becoming Long term ELLs.  The teacher will incorporate a Cognitive  Academic Language Learning Approach (CALLA) whereas students learn Meta- cognitively.  The teacher will use a variety of instructional strategies such as: read aloud,  modeled talk, scaffolding, extensive visuals, computer technology with current software  headphones are available which will aide in the students' listening skills), and graphic organizers.  Our supplemental Title III program will provide those students identified as Long Term  ELLs  (LTE)  the instructional support they need to become proficient in the English language.  Here, the teacher will model, practice and administer activities that mirror the  NYSESLAT.   Reading deficiencies across the ELA Common Core Learning Standards will be  identified and addressed.  Students will be engaged in rigorous learning tasks that support higher   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   order thinking.  They will be provided with appropriate scaffolds to help them successfully  analyze ELA reading and writing tasks.  Academic Intervention supports will be utilized  throughout this sub-group to address the language deficiencies of our students.  The Title III  Program is an after-school program and a supervisor will be on site to supervise the program.    Subgroups and Grade Levels of Students to be Served:  According to our qualitative and quantitative data analysis, we currently serve 12 students who  are long term ELLs, 9 students who are at risk of becoming long term ELLs, 31 students are at a  Transitioning level, 61 are Expanding level and 15 are at Emerging level and the remaining 27  are at Entering/Newcomer level.  All English as a New Language Learners across grades 6, 7, and 8 will be offered the Title III  after school program. Instructional will be specialized according to student needs/ELL  Status.  ELL subgroups will be as follows:  Subgroup A:  Newcomers/Entering level ELLs (Grades 6, 7, 8)   Subgroup B:  Students identified as being AT RISK of becoming long term ELLs  (Grades 6, 7,  8)   Subgroup C:  Long Term ELLs (Grades 6, 7, 8)  Subgroup D:  Expanding ELLs (Grades 6, 7, 8)  Schedule and Duration:    Students will be provided with 18 weeks of instruction. Instruction will take place after school on  Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:20 pm – 3:50 pm.  Three groups will meet on each  day.  Instruction will begin mid-November and end in mid-April.       Language of Instruction:  All classes will be taught in English with Native Language supports.   Number and Types of Certified Teachers:  There will be three ENL certified teachers teaching  the content in this program to enhance the acquisition of academic English and impact academic  achievement of our ELLs and ELL subgroups.    Types of Materials:  Supplemental material to be utilized for instruction aside from daily  instruction are:  Continental’s New York ENLs'  student book:  Addresses the speaking, listening, reading and  writing language domains.  This book focuses on Academic content and items required  for the  Common Core with an emphasis on reading for information.  Lessons from this book include  Response to Graphic Information, reading comprehension, comprehension of dialogue and  information, picture-based stories, listening for academic content, and fact-based essay writing,  which mimic the NYSESLAT.  Other Supplemental Material to be utilized for instruction:  Practice Exercises in Basic English (beginners):     This material presents skills in a simple progression using carefully prepared examples, followed  by exercises to develop them for the students. They are repeated in a variety of formats in order  for  students to learn and retain, in order to speak the English language.  Other materials included at no cost to the Title III program are English dictionaries, Native  Language Translation dictionaries, picture glossaries, computer technology, flashcards,  Software breaking news, Mathletics and Notebook Software.    All Title III letters will be sent home to the parents/guardians in their preferred home language  according to the HLIS.   In addition, our School Messenger will be utilized .  This School  Messenger sends out information to the parents/guardians in their  preferred languages.  Our  monthly calendar and events are also posted on our school portal which offers various Translated  Versions in a variety of languages.    Copies of all Title III letters will be maintained in the ENL Coordinator's office.  Each Title III  teacher will be given a class list of their students and an attendance sign-in sheet for the  students.  These students will sign in on a weekly basis and copies will be maintained in the ENL  Coordinator's office.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             Rationale:  At no cost to the Title III Program, our ENL teachers will receive training from the Department  of English Language Learners and Student Support (DELLSS).

Strong parental involvement is one factor  that research has shown over time to have positive outcomes on academic achievement and the  overall culture of the school.  Parental involvement supports, encourages, and provides  opportunities for parents and educators to work together on behalf of our students.  Maintaining  such a relationship is of utmost importance at I.S. 240 Magnet School of STEM.   Schedule and Duration:    In addition to our mandated activities, such as Parent Orientation during the ENL identification  process, we plan to implement a variety of Parent Engagement Workshops designed for the  parents of our English Language Learners.   Rationale for our Parent Workshops is based on the analysis and feedback provided by  parent/student surveys.    Parent Workshops will be scheduled once a month beginning in November 2018 and continue  through June 2019. The workshops will be held after school for two hours.  We will have  translators on site.  It is our hope that these activities will support ENL families and impact  higher achievement for our English Language Learners.  Topics to Be Covered:  1.     Resources available from the Department of English Language Learner Student Support   2.     Accessing and Understanding Student Data   3.     Preparing our children for the NYSESLAT  4.

What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      To determine the early literacy skills of our ELL students. I.S. 240 Magnet School of STEM uses a variety of assessment  tools.  Currently our school is using EdPerformance.  This assessment gives us data including student lexile level and alignment  to grade level standards.   The results of this assessment is available to all our teachers, as well as the students shortly after  administration of the exam.  After reviewing results of the data, teachers will realign differentiate lessons and plan according  to the students' weaknesses and or his/her level of skills.  Another teacher-created assessment are Unit Performance  Tasks.  These Unit Performance Tasks are created by teachers in each content area and they are aligned to the Common  Core.  These Unit Performance Tasks are also used as a form of formal assessments and benchmarks to assess the progress of  their reading and writing skills.    Our school also utilizes a variety of assessment tools including but not limited to, the following online program.  Breaking News  ESL is a free online technology based program that utilizes non fiction current events.  These articles are leveled 0 through 6  according to the students' lexile level.  Lexiles are used to measure the difficulty of the text based on sentence length, the  difficulty of the vocabulary and the frequency with which the words are seen in a passage.  The program uses the information  to match each each student to the students' instructional level of the text.  This program also has over twenty different  activities following each article.  These activities are scaffolded to aid in development and mastery of a variety of skills.  These  skills assess their reading comprehension, their writing short and extended responses as well as listening  skills.  Lexile Framework measures each students' non fiction reading comprehension for accurate levels of the reading  passages.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school currently offers Freestanding ENL instruction as the method of instruction for ELLs, based on parental preferences  on the Parent survey.  ENL instruction is provided for all ELLs as required under CR Part 154.  The classes are grouped by grade  and heterogeneously (mixed proficiency levels). Support is provided by word to word dictionaries, and bilingual glossaries for  each content area.  all ELL teachers, as well as subject area teachers who have ELLs, work together to support the native  language of the population in their classes.  Transitional and Expanding students will receive 180 minutes per week of  ENL.  Commanding students will receive 90 minutes per week ENL.  The instruction of the ENL component will be provided by a  licensed ELL teacher. This leveling will enable the students of each group to advance at their own rate, as well as challenge  them in various content areas.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   All assessment is intended to provide our teachers with detailed information of their ELL students in English Language  development.  The results of the assessment is available to all the teachers, as well as the students shortly after administration  of exam.  The ELL Periodic Assessment is un-timed which tests skills of three modalities, listening, reading and writing.  After  reviewing results of this data, teachers will teach, group and plan according to students' weaknesses in any specific modality  assessment is given three in the Fall and Spring.  The ELL Periodic is used to track the growth of the ELL students in their  English acquisition.  Detailed student results, including item analysis, are available in the ELL Periodic Assessment online.    The data is available to all content area teachers.  Data is discussed regularly at our ELL meetings, which are held weekly, as  well as during our common prep.  Teachers use this information to re-teach particular skills students may be lacking. The  insight to all the above data, along with the students' years of service, as well as biographical history provides information to  help teachers analyze and realign their lesson plans accordingly and re-teach any particular skill if needed.  These insights help  teachers look at where a student is gaining progress and where a student is having difficulty.  All data is continually examined  by teachers, as well as the Assistant Principal of the ELL Department, in order to drive vigorous instructional practices which  are aligned to the Common Core.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   AT I.S. 240 Magnet School of STEM we insure that a students' second language development is considered in our instructional  decisions through initially reviewing data results from the NYSITELL and/or the NYSESLAT.  We analyse this data and determine  the student's level of proficiency and in what modality the student needs the additional support.  Our ELL teachers are highly   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         qualified and certified licensed pedagogues.  They incorporate ENL Methodologies  and ENL Strategies  through instruction.  Native Language support is given when available to help gain literacy proficiency.  During small group  activities, students are grouped homogeneously when possible within the same language to help students develop literacy  through content.  Students are challenged through academic rigor that is aligned to the Common Core.  Classrooms are rich in  print, glossaries and bi-lingual dictionaries, which are incorporated throughout instruction.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   N/A      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     The data across proficiency levels is that Advanced students, on average, take an additional two years within that  level before reaching Proficiency and testing out.  Patterns revealed based on the modality of data across the three  grades, most students scored Expanding Advanced or Commanding/Proficient in Speaking, and Intermediate  Reading.  However, Listening and Writing data, revealed most students scored Transitional/Intermediate and  Emerging/Beginner levels respectfully.  Thus, Reading and Speaking were the strongest modalities where as Listening  and Writing are the weakest modalities.  Given this data, instruction will be aimed at addressing ELLs individualized  needs.  Prior knowledge, past experiences and cultural backgrounds will be incorporated into classroom  activities.  ELLs will be immersed in a print rich environment, where comprehension, participation and higher order of  thinking skills will be emphasized through the use of a wide variety of teaching methods and assessments, within  alignment of the Common Core State Standards.  Periodic assessments reinforced the data gathered in the  NYSESLAT.  Results are disseminated by our ELL Coordinator, Robin Horn, and distributed to all of ELL teachers.  This  detailed specific data is broken down by skills and the teachers use these results to differentiate their instruction so as  to better meet the individual needs of students.  Given this information, instruction will continue to be focused on  improving our students' proficiency in these areas.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Each program's success will be based upon its' effectiveness in helping our ELL students improve their English  language proficiency and achievement levels both within the classroom and on standardized exams.  Such  effectiveness is measured by data gathered from NY State exams,Ed Performance, data reports, the  NYSESLAT reports, as well as the DRP for the 6th and 7th graders and Unit Performance Tasks in all subject content  areas.  It is our goal that 15% of our 117 ELL students will advance in their English language proficiency as measured  by these various instruments.  Our programs' effectiveness will continue to be reviewed as we examine current data  to determine whether we are approaching our goals for the school year.  The content performances are based on the  prior years, City and State Math and ELA exam results.  Our school currently offers Freestanding ENL instruction as the  method of instruction for ELLs, based on parental preferences on the Parents Survey.  ENL instruction is provided for  all ELLs as required by the CR Part 154.2.  The ELL program is 75%  English instruction and 25% native language  support.  The classes are grouped by grade and heterogeneously (mixed proficiency levels).  Support is provided by  word-to-word dictionaries, and bilingual glossaries for each content area.  All ELL teachers, as well as subject area  teachers who have ELLs or former ELLs, work together to support the native language of the population in their  classes.  Transitional and Expanding students will receive   180 minutes per week of ENL.  Commanding students will  receive 90 minutes a week ENL.  The instruction of the ELL component will be provided by a licensed ELL teacher.  This  leveling will enable the students of each group to advance at their own rate as well as challenge them in various  content areas.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?           As per CR Part 154.2 instruction for our ELLs will be delivered with the mandated requirements.  Students within their  grade, 6th, 7th, or 8th will travel together with their group heterogeneously (mixed proficiency levels).  Students who are in a  co-teaching/integrated program, will be with two teachers who are both certified in different areas.  One teacher will be  certified in TESOL while the other teacher is certified in a common branch or content area license.  Another program that may  be delivered is an integrated approach, having one teacher who is dually certified in both ESL and common branch/or content  area.  In the stand alone program the teacher must retain a K-12 TESOL license.  The following are  required minutes given to  our ELLs according to their proficiency level as mandated by the CR Part 154.2  and will not be grouped above two grade spans  unless those that are identified as ELLs in a Special Education class:      Entering = two units of study per week (360 minutes)    Emerging = two units of study per week (360 minutes)    Transitioning = one unit of study per week (180 minutes)    Expanding = one unit of study per week (180 minutes)    Commanding = former ELLs will receive half unit of study per week (90 minutes)       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.

What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   For the 2018/2019  school year the  ELA/ENL Departments are using the Scholastic Code X Curriculum and National Geograhic  Collections.  The curriculum includes a student edition with close reading exemplars and performance tasks.  The teachers'  edition includes a framework for whole and small group instruction in Close Reading, Text complexity Analysis, Rubrics word  study and scaffolding for writing and reading comprehension.  Throughout all the content areas:  Science, Math, Social Studies   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      and ELA/ENL instructional approaches used are:  Academic and Content Vocabulary which is incorporated into all subject areas  of instruction.  Scaffolding and extensive use of visuals, gestures, audio-visual materials, graphic organizers, hands-on materials  and computer technology are incorporated throughout the lesson as well.  State certified licensed ESL teachers use QTEL methodology, the Natural Approach, CALLA, and TPR to ensure that LEP students  meet the standards and ach8ieve at high levels on assessments.  The materials used for instruction are aligned with the NY  State Common Core Standards and NYC ENL Standards.  In our varied approaches and methods' subject area content is made  comprehensible to enrich language development.  We are also incorporating Code-X and Ready New York 2018/2019 which is aligned to the CCLS.  These programs are  integrated programs of assessment and data driven instruction designed to teach the Common Core Learning Standards  English Language Arts.  It is used in a supplemental way to address specific standards where students require additional  instruction and practice.  Both programs also provide differentiated instruction and independent practice of key concepts and  skills that build student confidence.  Word Generation Series is also incorporated into our Literacy program.  This program is a research-based vocabulary program  for middle school students designed to teach words through language arts, math, science and social studies classes.  Word  Generation employs several strategies to ensure that students learn words in a variety of contexts.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  We ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home language throughout  the year using a variety of  assessments.  There are many factors including, their environment, their familiarity with and exposure to English,  socioeconomic status, prior schooling experiences, and life experiences, that interact with and influence their  learning.   Authentic assessment is always used in addition to progress monitoring to determine what students know and can  do, as well as what they need to learn.  As part of this process, English language acquisition specialists should assess ELLs'  language proficiency and academic skills in English and their first language.  special Education teachers, psychologists, and/or  Speech Language Therapists may conduct additional formal and informal assessments.  Team members should observe the  child in different contexts to better understand the instructional environment and the conditions the student seems to both  thrive and struggle.  Students are often evaluated in Spanish using the LAB-R.  Students who speak other languages are often  evaluated in their language using a LENS.  Other evaluations include, but are not limited to, the NYSITELL results, as well as the  NYSELAT results.  Evaluation is done throughout the year formally, as well as informally.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  a) Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) are students who upon enrollment were performing two or more years  below grade level in Literacy in his/her native language and or mathematics.  Our SIFE students will receive small group  instruction as well as be recommended to receive Academic Intervention Services.  Our SIFE students, if there are 20 or more  enrolled at the start of the year, will receive small group instruction through a SIFE grant if approved.  This grant will allow  small group instruction after school or before school Certified ELL teacher will work with students to help develop literacy skills  needed based on tn the results from the NYSESLAT.    b) Newcomers are students who are newly identified ELLs and remain ELLs for up to three years.  These students are not just  students who are Newcomers but may also be students who are born in the United States, but are identified as an ELL based  on the NYSITELL data.  These students will have differentiated instruction based on his/her proficiency level and or needs and  receive the mandated minutes required by CR Part 154 Instruction according to results of the NYSITELL and or NYSESLAT.  They  will use their Native language to help develop literacy skills.  Certified ENL teacher and or Certified Content Area teachers will  incorporate ENL methodologies and varies ENL strategies that include visual support, technology and a classroom rich in print.     c) Developing Students are those students who remain an ELL for four to six years.  These students will also continue to receive  his/her mandated minutes as per the CR Part 154.  Differentiated instruction will be delivered by by certified pedagogues in  ENL and/or Content area.  They will have small group instruction by area of skill needed.  All instruction will have academic  rigor and be aligned with the Common Core.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61        d) Long Term ELLs (LTE) are students who have remained an EL for seven or more years continuously enrolled in the United  States.  These students will receive differentiated instruction through small groups and/or receive Academic Intervention  Instruction (AIS) by a qualified pedagogue in the area/skill that he/she is not performing proficient in as indicated on the  NYSESLAT.     e) Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status will receive half a unit (90 minutes) of Integrated ENL in ELA/content  area.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      It is important to consider the unique characteristics ENL-SWDs bring to the learning environment and to think about how  factors including their familiarity with and exposure to English, socioeconomic status, prior schooling experiences and life  experiences, interact with and influence their learning.  Authentic assessments should be used in addition to progress  monitoring to determine what students know and can do, as well as what they need to learn.  As part of this process, English  Language acquisition specialists should assess ENLs' language proficiency and academic skills in English and their first  language.  Special Education teachers, psychologists, and/or speech language therapists may conduct additional formal and  informal assessments.  Team members should observe the child in different contexts to better understand the instructional  environment.  Ells with special needs receive grade level material that is aligned to the Common Core.  Our ENL-SWDs are provided with  plenty of visuals and dramatized reading material.  Total Physical Response methodologies building academic vocabulary,  simplifying content and concept knowledge are ways to provide access to academic content and accelerate English language  development.  The technology that is used to help these students includes Smart Boards, CD players, i-Pads, Laptops/Computers.  The ENL  teacher meets with the School Based Support Team in collaboration with the Special Education Assistant Principal and the  Special Ed teacher/IEP Teacher to make sure ENL-SWDs receive the correct ENL services.  In some cases, a Bilingual Assistant  helps the student in class throughout the day.  The ENL-SWDs use the same materials and do the same work as the  mainstream students.  However, the tasks and assignments are differentiated based on the student's abilities and on the  IEP.  Some students may need simplified instruction and or have the task broken down into smaller components.  Furthermore, multiple intelligence problem solving strategies are also used by teachers to promote academic success.  These  strategies include linguistic, logical-mathematical, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal and naturalistic.  It is important to  consider the unique characteristics ENLs bring to the learning environment and to think about how factors including their  familiarity with and exposure to English, socioeconomic status, prior schooling experiences, and life experiences, interact with  and influence their learning.  Authentic assessments should be used in addition to progress monitoring to determine what  students know and can do, as well as what they need to learn.  As part of this process, English language acquisition specialists  assess ENLs' language proficiency and academic skills in English and their first language.  Special education teachers,  psychologists, and/or speech language therapists may conduct additional formal and informal assessments.  Team members  observe the child different contexts to better understand the instructional environment and the conditions the student seems  to both thrive and struggle.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   I.S 240 Magnet School of Stem uses curriculum instructional and scheduling flexibility to ensure all of our ELL/SWDs obtain  their goals within the least restrictive environment. Our ENL Coordinator, Robin Horn, is an active participant of our IEP team  working with our Special Education Specialist, Hilary Hadar, IEP/SETSS teacher.  Alene Guenther, our Special Education  Guidance Counselor and Eileen Touhy, our School Psychologist and our Special Ed Assistant Principal create obtainable goals  and effective instructional strategies to properly meet the needs of our ENLs.  Our special education teachers work together  with our program director to create scheduling flexibility that allows us to provide the services that meet the critical needs of  ENLs/SWDs.  I.S. 240 Magnet School of STEM uses curricular instruction and schedules flexibility to ensure ENL/SWDs receive  their mandated IEP requirements and attain English proficiency in the least restrictive environment.  New York State certified  licensed ENL teachers and certified special education teachers, as well as Content area teachers use QTEL methodology, the  Natural Approach, CALLA and TPR to ensure that LEP students meet the standards and pass the required 6th, 7th and 8th  grade NYS assessments.  The materials used for instruction are aligned with NYS and NYC ENL standards.  The ENL  methodologies used incorporated listening, speaking, reading, and writing within the curriculum.  This creates a  comprehensive and complete English language immersion.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      Cooperative planning amongst ENL/SWD teachers, all teachers of ENLs and former ENLs occurs informally on a monthly  schedule.  Three of our ENL teachers have completed the Quality Teaching for Secondary English Learners Professional  Development training within their content areas.  All our teachers are trained to incorporate ENL methodologies and strategies  and use the Natural Approach, CALLA, and TPR to ensure that ENL-SWDs meet the standards and pass the required 6th, 7th  and 8th grade Common Core State assessments.  Licensed ENL teachers, Assistant principal, Special Education and IEP teachers  collaborate on which programs and materials would best suit our ENL-SWDs on each ENL grade and content area.  The  materials used for instruction are aligned to the Common Core in all content areas.            11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ENL students targeted in need of Academic Intervention Support (AIS) in the areas of ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies will  receive a wide range of services.  Breaking News ENL is aligned with the Common Core State Standards at utilizes non-fiction  reading passages adapted for each ENL student's individual reading lexile level.  This program incorporates all the modalities  which enhances their reading/writing/listening skills and speaking skills.  Social Studies and Science articles will be read,  analyzed, discussed, and assessed by students within this program.  Teachers will choose reading material to support topics  already being implemented in classrooms.  This material will support learning taking place with the classroom.  ENLs will also  be targeted for improved student outcomes in ELA and Mathematics.  Students will be serviced within Academic Support  Intervention programs.  Their academic progress will be examined by the School Inquiry Team. In addition, students targeted  will receive tutorial assistance on a 10:01 ration two times a week.  Finally, students will be enrolled in our Title III Academy after school program.  Within the Title III program, students receive  specific academic intervention in Mathematics, English Language Arts, and Science and Social Studies within small  groups.  Work done in this program is focused on meeting the needs of individual students according to a variety of skill  specific data reports.  We have also implemented additional services to meet the needs of our SIFE population.  These students  receive additional services for an hour twice a week in a small group setting.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  For the next school year, we will continue offering our ENL students our Title III After School Program.  We will also continue to  invite our ELLs to our Achieve Now Academy on Saturdays.  This Program allows students to receive additional support in the  content area where the student is not showing progress and needs further academic intervention.  In September 2017, the school will become I.S. 240 Magnet School of STEM and all ELLs will be participating in the various  programs.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   N/A     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All our ELLs at I. S. Magnet School of STEM are afforded equal access to all school programs.  Our ELLs currently attend our  Saturday Academy, as well as our Title III program and an Immigrant Math morning program.   Other programs that they are  currently involved include but are not limited to are Chess Club, Parent Engagement Paint Night, Puppets in  Animation (through Brooklyn College), Gifted and Talented Programs and Honor Society/Regents Program.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our ENL classes use a wide range of instructional materials to support learning.  These materials include but not limited to are  bilingual dictionaries, word to word glossaries in all core content areas and ENL classroom library.  Native support is also given  to core content areas through the use of computers for translation when available.  In addition, our ENL department infuses  the use of technology to classes by use of laptops fort student use within the classrooms.  These laptops ae used to enhance  and enrich classroom instruction.  In addition, these laptops are used with the Breaking News ESL Literacy differentiation  program.  Another technology based program that our ELLs utilize is Mathletics.  Through the collaboration of a writing grant   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      our ENL Coordinator, Robin Horn and ENL Assistant Principal Denise Nopper received a grant for our ENL Math  Department.  This program includes 30 laptops and laptop cars with log in accounts for all our ELLs, including our SIFE and  LTE.  Spatial Temporal program focuses on problem solving techniques utilizing puzzles and visual questions with limited  words.  This program enhances critical thinking skills a non-threatening environment allowing students to explore math  problems through a process of trial and error.  In addition, computer technology is offered to our classes within the Computer Related Arts program, as well as through daily  and weekly visits to the school library.  Our ENL classrooms are also equipped with state of the art Smart Board Technology  which is used to facilitate instruction.  Students receive the same New York State/City approved common Core Curriculum  textbooks as their English only speaking counterparts.  They, however, receive supplemental materials to aide in English  Language acquisition.  Listening centers, picture books, dictionaries, grading books, science books, math materials are all in  place to support learning.             16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).     Students who score at the Entering Level on the NYSITELL will receive 100% of Native Language Support in ENL class.  As their  English proficiency level improves, Native language support is scaffolded to 75% and for Emerging level students to 50% for  those students who score a transitional level.  Those students who score at Expanding level will receive 25% Native language  support with a content area.  Those who score Proficient/Commanding will continue to receive Native language support about  25% in a content area for an additional two years.  Those students Non-fiction reading passages are delivered to students in  English with Spanish and Haitian-Creole support prompts.  Students speaking other languages will receive support through our  multi-lingual staff.  Students also have translation dictionaries in all classes.  Support is also given by having Word to Word  glossaries.  For students with low incidence language we try and pair them with a buddy of the same language.  We also have  readily available bilingual dictionaries in a multitude of languages.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We recognize that all students need to be working from age/grade appropriate materials.  All materials used within our  books  that focus on skill specific requirements need per grade level.  All resources used within our ENL program are New York  City aligned and New York State Standards and Common Core Standard work.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.

This annual Progress Workshop will focus on goals for the program,  language assessment results, as well as language development needs in all content areas.  At all meetings  there will be interpreters in the parent's preferred language, as well as translation on all  documentation's.  Forging a strong partnership between school and home is vital to nurturing the academic  and social growth of students.  Strong parental involvement is one factor that research has shown time and  time again to have positive effects on academic achievement and overall culture of the school.  Parental  involvement supports, encourages and provides opportunities for parents and educators to work together  on behalf of our students.  Maintaining such a relationship is of the utmost importance at I.S. 240 Magnet  School of STEM.  We have an open door policy at the school, so parents know they are always welcome.  Written information  about classroom assignments, goals, assessments and school events are translated to the best of our  ability.  Robin Horn, our ENL Coordinator will conduct interviews with students, parents and/or guardians.   Additionally, curriculum based parent workshops are provided periodically.  The workshops provide parents  the opportunity to become familiar with school curriculum, culture and activities provided for all students  including ENLs.   During these workshops the parents are given the opportunity to discuss any concerns and  evaluate instructional based programs.    At I.S. 240 Magnet School of STEM, monthly Parent Association meetings are conducted.  Parents are also  given the opportunity to havr their concerns addressed.  A monthly calendar of meetings are provided to  parents in a variety of languages.  We have seen an increase of ENL parent involvement at our many school  events, and Parent Association meetings.  Parents feel comfortable to reach out to us anytime where there  is a concern they may have with their child.  All agendas and sign-in sheets are retained in a secure central  location with the ENL Coordinator.        , testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    2.   3.   4.   The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67             5.  6.   7.   8.   9.

If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68              Part VI: LAP Assurances   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      involvement   the  the   families.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      There are various ways that I.S. 240 Magnet School of STEM uses data to assess the school's written translation as  well as oral interpretation needs. We ensure that all parents are provided with appropriate and timely  information in a language that they can understand. Data regarding the languages spoken in the home of our  English Language Learners are reviewed as needed on an ongoing basis. In terms of our new admits to the school,  our licensed ENL Coordinator, Robin Horn, conducts a written interview completing the HLIS with and interpreter  if needed. An oral interview is done with the student upon admission to the school. The ENL Coordinator keeps a  running record of the languages spoken in the homes of our students. Our Pupil Accounting Secretary, Therese  Callegari, continually updates, prints and shares information from all available ATS reports. Our ENL Coordinator,  Robin Horn, also has access to ATS and continuously reviews reports such as, but not limited to, the RHLA, RPOB,  RYOS, RLEC and the RAPL. Our Assistant Principal, Denise Nopper, transfers all pertinent data needed and keeps  an ongoing report on an excel spread sheet which is easily accessible. These reports break down the languages   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72      spoken in the homes of all our students. In an effort to better support our English Language Learners and their  families, it is our belief that as much communication with language support should be in place between school  and the home, Therefore, it is our belief that families need and must be provided with appropriate and timely  information in their Native language in order to establish and maintain a home/school partnership.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       The mechanisms our school uses to gather feedback from our ELL Parents to ensure that they understand the  availability of services and the availability of programs are through various assessments such as following but not  limited to: Upon enrollment newly enrolled parent will meet with our ELL Coordinator to have parents watch the  Orientation Video, as well as complete the Parent Survey and Selection Form. This forms in the parents preferred  language gives the parents information to make an informed decision regarding the best program for his/her child,  Also as part of assessment our ELL Coordinator will continue to monitor this information in the ELPC Screen in ATS.  Along with this and Feedback from parents regarding goals, flexibility and curriculum progress our ELL Coordinator will  keep a running log to ensure that the parents needs and or concerns are being met. This will be done on an Individual  Face to Face meeting as well as ELL parent workshops. To ensure that parents are accurately informed and in a timely  matter Translators are available at all meetings.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80
