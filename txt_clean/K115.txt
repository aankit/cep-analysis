This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   P.S. 115’s mission is to measure our successes one student at a time, by providing a rigorous curriculum that ensures  all students SH.I.N.E. academically and socially. With collaboration between home and school, students will become  lifelong learners who are college and career ready.    In an effort to infuse our vision and mission for all children at P.S. 115, we recognize the importance of meeting  students’ needs, and learning styles . Incorporating the arts disciplines is a key factor to student success at P.S. 115. To  that end, we have licensed art, and music teachers, as well as multiple residencies such as African Drumming, Chess   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      and Guitar Lessons. To further support student learning, we are implementing S.T.R.E.A.M. (science, technology,  reading, engineering, arts and math) programs, one science based, one literacy based, and a Robotics Program.  Students will grow in the the corresponding areas through project based, hands on learning.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P.S. 115 is an elementary school in Canarsie, Brooklyn that serves students from Pre-Kindergarten through grade 5.  We host six Pre-Kindergarten classes, Citywide Gifted and Talented Program for classes in grades K-5. In addition,  each grade contains an in-house gifted class, as well as an ELL concentrated class, and an Integrated Co-Teaching  (I.C.T.) class. There is a self- contained, 12:1:1 classroom on each grade.       We are a school of distributive leadership. Teachers and Paraprofessionals, as well as out of class staff members take  on various leadership roles to bring vertical as well as collaborative practices within the school building. Along with  our mathematics and literacy “think tanks” to ensure Common Core alignment, we have a data think tank, S.H.I.N.E.  team, Response to Intervention team, arts team, STREAM team, a gifted and talented vertical team, PD team, and  collaborative grade teams.      To ensure that our fifth grade students are college and career ready, we have implemented a departmentalization  program in grade 5 to help bridge the achievement gap. Students have the opportunity to work with an expert in both  English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics. Teachers work and plan in teams, concentrating their teaching in their  area of expertise.      Our Monday afternoons are specifically targeted for teamwork. Teachers completed a survey and joined teams within  their area of expertise or interest. The focus of each team is to study and research best practices and lines of inquiry.  Teachers will work in 6 week cycles to ensure a thorough inquiry based process, then share their findings with the  staff. Teachers will also plan unit plans/curriculum maps and pacing calendars aligned to the Major, Supporting, and  Additional Common Core Learning standards in Literacy and Mathematics.       The S.H.I.N.E. Program is a Positive Behavior Intervention Support system that focuses on positive actions of students.  It is evidence based and used to provide preventative, positive and behavioral support for all students. The letters of  S.H.I.N.E. stand for Strength, Honor. Integrity, Nobility and Excellence. The program helps foster self-esteem in  individual students, as well as encouraging positive peer interactions. Positive Reinforcement promotes social and  emotional competencies individually, whole class and school wide. This program fosters positive experiences among  children through pep rallies, rewards, dance parties and other activities. Students earn S.H.I.N.E. tokens for positive  behaviors and they are invited to the school store on a consistent basis to trade their bucks in for prizes.   P.S. 115 values the importance of parental involvement as well as family engagement. We offer a variety of parent  and family workshops during morning, evening and weekend hours to accommodate working families. Our workshops  include, but are not limited to; Helping Your Child Succeed on the New York State Tests, Understanding the Common  Core, College and Career Readiness for your Child, Helping Your Child With Homework, Math Matters, Stream  Workshop, STAR 360 Workshop etc., Additionally, we hold many family engagement activities, such as a Character  Day Dance, Family Dance Nights, Saturday Family Drumming Program, Family Math Nights and Movie Nights. Due to a  need in our community, we have implemented and now host a Saturday morning General Equivalency Diploma (GED)   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Program that is run by the New York City Department of Education Office of Adult Education. This program as well as  an Adult ESL program will enable parents of our school community to acquire the intellectual tools needed to help  their children succeed.      P.S. 115 works in a partnership with New York University to hold a family program called "ParentCorps". ParentCorps  is a social/emotional program for families. It's focus is to work together to engage and support entire communities of  parents and early childhood teachers to promote positive home and classroom experiences that strengthen children's  early learning, behavior and health. The program runs for 14 week sessions and all family members, including siblings,  are encouraged to attend.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   P.S. 115 has 6 special education self contained classes, 6 ICT Classes and 6 ENL classes. There is one on each grade  level. The students in these classes have various diagnosis, which include learning disabilities, emotional disabilities,  speech and language impaired and students on the autism spectrum.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Over the past year, our school has made the most progress in effective school leadership and building trust within the  school community.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     A comparative analysis of the 2017/2018 CEP writing assessments results indicated 75% of students across grades K  through 5 moved up at least a minimum of 2 marginal levels or reached the maximum level of the rubric. 55% of  students across grades K through 5 achieved a level 3, based on the rubric. Although students writing improved  through the continued implementation of Teacher’s College Writing curriculum and the introduction of Wonder's  Literacy Program, it is necessary to raise academic expectations, so that more students can achieve grade level  proficiency.       The STAR 360 assessment data revealed that although students' ability in reading has increased, there is a low  percentage of students reading on grade level. It was determined that students' comprehension, ability to use  evidence from the text to clearly demonstrate their understanding were areas in need of improvement.      It is evident that there is a need to continue the implementation of professional learning in Literacy Instruction to  design responsive curriculum, develop teacher collaboration, and foster best practices that will reflect in increased  student achievement. In addition, it is necessary to maintain an ongoing system of monitoring student progress  throughout the year.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51        Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 115, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.

Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community. P.S. 115 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ●providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ●fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      ●providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ●sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ●providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   P.S.115’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Our  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing P.S.115’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of  the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, our school will:   ●actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills or other programs  that meet the needs of our families;    ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ●support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

While some of  these tests are translated into the children’s native language, not all are.  After analyzing these  standardized test results, it has been determined that many ELL students need additional support  in order to meet the promotional standards.  Our Saturday Institute will provide such additional support as well as improve English language  proficiency in these students.  Indicators of success include, but are not limited to, increased  student English language proficiency as demonstrated in portfolios, oral communication, written  communication, and standardized test scores.  Title III Supplemental instruction in Literacy, Mathematics, and Science will be provided to the  ELLs (in grades Kindergarten through Five) who are at the Beginning, Intermediate, or  Advanced levels of proficiency in English based on the results of LAB R and NYSESLAT.  All  of our ESL students who achieve proficiency will continue to receive support through our  Saturday Literacy, Mathematics and Science programs at no cost to the Title III Program.  The ELL instruction will take place during a Saturday Institute.  The ENL Institute will run for  twelve weeks in three and four hour sessions (from 8:00 A.M. to 12:00 PM).  There will be five  four-hour sessions for Literacy ( November through January) and three four-hour sessions for  Mathematics (January through February), and four three-hour sessions for Science  (March).  There will be one certified teacher for each class on grades Kindergarten,One, Two,  Three, Four and Five for Literacy and Mathematics and two certified teachers on grade Four for  Science. Students will be grouped as follows  K and 1, grades 2 and 3 and  grades 4 and 5. The  ESL teacher will push-in to work with each group of ELLs for an hour.  An administrator will be  available for guidance, safety,arrival and dismissal of children.  A licensed ENL teacher, supported by content area teachers in math and science will participate  in a team-teaching environment to provide direct instruction to ELLs.  Reading and writing skills  will be reinforced through the use of such techniques as phonemic awareness and balanced  literacy. Newcomers will receive small group instruction in order to build listening, reading and  writing skills.  Materials include, but are not limited to:  Fundations, Making Meaning, Every Day Counts, NYS  March to March COACH, Essential Skills for Reading Success, Terranova Coach, NY Edits,  ELA Rehearsal, CARS, Rally, and Wilson, Test Ready Omni and NYS Practice and Mastery in  Mathematics, and Measuring Up to the New York State Learning Standards and Success  Strategies for the State Test (Science).  Instruction will include lessons in Literacy, Mathematics, and Science.  It is hoped that through  this Institute we will be able to increase the English proficiency and prepare ELL students for the  standardized tests that they are required to take.  All instruction will be in English.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65         Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:                At PS 115, our English Language Learners on each grade (with very few exceptions) are placed  in one class designated as the ENL concentration class.  The teachers of these ENL concentration  classes will be participating in professional development workshops during common prep  periods, Professional Development Days, and at after-school workshops to enable them to better  meet the needs of their ELL students.  Occasionally, ELL students (in the case of siblings) must  be placed in another class on the grade.  The teachers of these students will be included in this  professional development as well.  This professional Development focuses on strategies to  strengthen the English proficiency of English Language Learners.  Teachers are introduced to  activities and suggestions to improve the performance of these students.  This professional  development is at no cost to the Title III Program.  For Title III program, each Saturday ELL Institute teacher will receive six hours of additional  professional development at after-school workshops which will be provided by the ENL teacher  in conjunction with the Literacy Coach, Mathematics Coach, and Science Cluster Teacher.  The  series of workshops (open to Title III, Saturday ELL Institute teachers only) will include one  after-school workshop in each subject area that is in alignment with Title III.  The second  workshop will involve participants collaboratively creating a series of lesson plans for use in the  Saturday ELL Institute. Teachers will be paid through fair student funding.  Classroom teachers are often unfamiliar with the techniques and strategies needed to provide  additional support for the English Language Learner.  Professional Development workshops will  introduce these techniques and strategies.  Additionally, teachers will be afforded the opportunity  to create classroom materials which will benefit their students.  Teachers will meet two hours for  each of three sessions.  Upon completion of the Professional Development workshops, these teachers will be better  equipped to meet the needs of their students.  Indicators of success are increased use of the  techniques, strategies, and materials presented in the Professional Development workshops as  well as increased student English language proficiency as demonstrated in portfolios, oral  communication, written communication, and standardized test scores.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use Periodic Assessments, including but not limited to: Performance series, TCRWP writing baseline for ELLs in grades  three through five, STAR 360 and F&P for English Language Learners in all grades, as well as Fundations assessments in grades  K-2. These  provide teachers with detailed information about student strengths and weaknesses and will help drive instruction  and professional development.           2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   P.S. 115 staff are trained prior to the application of assessments and or curriculum embedded assessments. Post training of  Periodic Assessments teachers are encouraged to share input amongst each grade during common planning. Teachers assess   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70   students every 6-8 weeks, this helps teachers to teach effectively by planning for each students needs.  TCRWP are trained throughout the year with continuous professional development. ELL planning is also embedded within  the  curriculum; teachers with ELLs in classroom are sent to PDs at Teachers College for additional support.  Teachers are trained in Star 360 computer based assessment program and have an on-line, phone support for technical  difficulties.   Majority of P.S. 115 K-2 teachers are or have been trained in Fundations. Trained administrators turn- key information to  newly hired and are also supported by our seasoned teachers. Fundations is an instrumental tool that supports ELLs while  learning phonemes especially for our SIFE students.  To conclude, teachers are supported with a great deal of Professional Development along with support from colleagues and  administrators. With the use of these assessments  it provides the teacher with detailed information about student  strengths and weaknesses and will help drive instruction and professional development.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?    The ESL teacher collaborates with the mainstream teachers regarding student progress, curriculum, available ESL materials,  testing concerns and ESL techniques. NYSITELL entrance exam are used to indicate baseline for newly enrolled ELLs  and NYSESLAT exams are used  to measure progress both test identifies each students area of nead.The ESL teacher continues  to monitor the progress and the language development of those students who have passed the NYSESLAT.  The mainstream  teachers are informed of their students’ status and if necessary, Academic Intervention Services are provided. ENL Teachers  meet regularly to assess, discuss and monitor how their ENL students are doing in all content areas. They then meet with  parents to provide instructional materials and at-home support in order to move the students' progress.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    ELL teacher collaborates with mainstream teacher to discuss and plan based on student's base line/benchmark  assessments  teacher of ELLs are sent to PDs through the year on content area instruction and are also given PDs from the ENL teacher. P.S.  115 also provides common planning with teachers of ELLs  while the ENL teacher supports and guides mainstream teachers  on  lesson planning to address the needs of their students. Parents are also included by being provided instructional materials  and at home support in order to move students progress.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   With the use of the RTI model,  P.S. 115's goals are to build on more effective individualized instructional programs. Beyond  screening and identification for ENL services to support language development,the ELL student takes part in the RTI screening  to assess whether his/her literacy skills and competencies are meeting grade level bench marks. If the student is flagged as an  at risk or below grade level bench-mark the student will receive target instructional support to develop in the specific content  area. This support should be delivered in coordination with language support services.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Data patterns on the NYSESLAT reveal that ELLs across all proficiency levels performed best on the listening and speaking  sections.  Lower performance scores were in reading and writing.  With the support of the ENL teacher, and classroom  teachers we have been working together to improve student reading and writing.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   In addition to materials, students are also provided the RTI model by the use of highly trained  teachers who solely focuses on  each child's grow and glows. The additional support allows effective individualized instruction based on specific content  area the support is also delivered in coordination with language support services.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71       Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   P.S. 115's ELLs are serviced by a certified ESOL teacher in a free standing program of heterogeneously grouped  students through Push-In services which include English Language Arts and content area instruction. ELLs are placed in  a concentrated class per grade this allows a seamless collaboration between classroom teacher and ESOL teacher to  provide intergrated ENL and ELL services.    b.  TBE program.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Entering and Emerging students receive 8/45 minute periods of ENL weekly. Entering ELL's get 180 minutes of stand-alone ENL  and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA; Emerging ELL's receive at least 2/45 minute periods of stand-alone and 4/45 minute  periods of integrated ENL weekly plus 2/45 minute periods of stand-alone or integrated ENL weekly. Transitioning and  Expanding students receive 4/45 minute periods of ENL weekly. Transitioning ELL's receive 2/45 minute periods of integrated  ENL and 2/45 minute periods of stand-alone or integrated ENL; Expanding ELL's receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL.  Commanding ELL's receive 2/45 minute periods of integrated ENL for 2 years after they test out of ENL on the NYSESLAT.  students Home Language Identification Survey is taken into consideration during planning and scheduling students individual  schedule       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Content area instruction has been supported by the acquisition of supplemental instructional materials aligned to the New  York State Performance Standards and the New York State Learning Standards.  Practices and approaches include, but are not  limited to: scaffolding to support student learning in the content area, bridging techniques that connect new concepts to prior  knowledge, using multicultural literature and visual aids in content area instruction, and employing dramatic and oral  presentations to enhance communication and understanding. The school uses a balanced literacy approach to develop literacy  skills through read alouds, guided reading, phonics instruction and modeled and shared writing. ESL students have access to  Leap Frog Schoolhouse-Leap Track System which is computer assisted instruction through software design to remediate and  strengthen basic skills.  Classrooms in which there are ELLs contain leveled libraries in English and bilingual leveled libraries. Students have access to  bilingual glossaries and dictionaries in all of their classrooms. Teachers and paraprofessionals are available to translate for the  students in the different languages spoken at P.S. 115.  Students are also offered, but are not limited to the services of the  Translation Services Unit which provides certified translators to support ELL students in their respective languages.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   ELLs are formally evaluated in their home language, only if after intervention, they are recommended to SBST, and it has been  determined that this is necessary for the child's academic success. Otherwise, home language evaluations are done informally   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72      by one of our multi-lingual staff members with the ESL teacher present. P.S. 115 also uses Star 360 is an data assessment  program which allows teachers to analyze where students are struggling academically and where to provide continuous  support. Star360 assessments are done once a month. Students use bilingual glossaries for class work, homework and  exams.         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.  SIFE  students are offered a variety of supplementary services in addition to ENL in (2) 50 minute blocks. These include:  AIS,  Star 360, DRA, and  Saturday Academy which runs from December 2015 through April 2016 The program is run through 6- 8 week sessions at a time. These supplemental programs especially supports ELL's and students with special needs. Aligned  tasks are embedded in each unit of study. Each Common Core-Aligned Task is accompanied by a variety of instructional  supports including: culminating performance tasks, guidance and use of UDL principles for each task, rubrics and/or scoring  guides, annotated student work ranging across levels and task specific supports.  c.   Developing ELL's participate in a balanced literacy approach which includes phonics, fluency, vocabulary and text  comprehension. Ongoing assessments include: retelling of stories, use of figurative language, rubrics, standardized Interim  Assessments, and conferencing with subject area teachers. Some of the strategies used include: use of prior knowledge, word  walls, modeling, graphic organizers, frequent summaries, re-presentation, meaningful “talk”, and student choice, thus  providing activities using different modalities while using the workshop model. Students learn in an environment that is  organized, stimulating, and comfortable in order to maximize their language and literacy development.  d. Specific needs of individual long-term ELL’s are assessed by their subject area teachers, as well as the ESL teacher and other  support staff. Results of standardized tests, baseline DRA, Acuity test scores, Alternate Assessment and monthly ELA, Math,  Science and Social Studies assessments, are combined with teacher assessments of class work, homework, promotional folders  and anecdotals, to determine the specific needs of each student. Based on these findings, the long-term ELL may be placed in a  class with the following services; AIS,  etc. In addition, they may be recommended for the Saturday Academy, (2) 50 minute  instruction, and the Title III ESL After-school Program. Long tem Ells are mostly students with disabilities. They receive  differentiated instruction that is spelled out in their IEP’s.  e. Former ELL's up to 2 years after exiting ENL receive at least 2/45 minute periods weekly of ENL in the content area. These  services are integrated within their ELA and Math classes. They are grouped accordingly and the ESL teacher differentiates the  instruction using pictures, modeling, frequent summaries and re-presentation. As in all our classes, scaffolding is used.  The parents' of former ELL's who tested at the Commanding level in the past 2 years on the NYSESLAT, are notified in their  native language that their child tested out and will be receiving 90 minutes of ESL weekly. Proficient level students continue to  learn through scaffolding, and differentiated instruction. They are placed in the same class on each grade as the ELL’s so that  they can benefit from the services of the ESL teacher during periods of push-in. Students who received a score of Proficient on  the NYSESLAT in the past 2 years are entitled to extended time on all NYS exams;  and/or exams translated in to their native  language. They are also invited to participate in all special events geared specifically towards the ELL’s. They are encouraged to  visit the ESL teacher regularly to discuss concerns, problems, progress, etc. Subject area teachers are informed that Proficient  level students are second language learners and may have needs that are different than native English learners and more  similar to the ELL’s in their class.  All ELL’s are afforded access to all school programs. The ESL teacher informs parents about the programs at our monthly  meetings. The Parent Coordinator informs parents of all school activities on a regular basis. In addition to the targeted  intervention programs listed above, ELL's are also invited to participate to Saturday  Academy, Title II and all other school  programs.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?      Teachers of ELL-SWDs are given ESL resources such as Skill Sharpeners, Pearson Longman 'ConerStone' catered to their  respected academic levels, bilingual glossaries and picture dictionaries to aid with visual cues in differentiating instruction.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73      Small group instruction and the use of centers also allows lessons to be more student directed the teacher will facilitate to  help students feel confident and take more ownership in given task.:       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   Classroom and cluster teachers collaborate with the ESL teacher to plan differentiated lessons for SWDs utilizing of the  student's IEP to look at students recommendations. The lessons are aligned with the common core standards. In planning,  teachers decide if lessons should be taught in native language to facilitate comprehension and learning. P.S. 115 uses flexible  scheduling to accommodate services for  SWDs.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  To help our ELLs meet the learning standards various instructional practices are utilized.  Practices/approaches include, but are  not limited to: scaffolding to support student learning in the content area, bridging techniques that connect new concepts to  prior knowledge, using multicultural literature such as Longman Cornerstone series, skill sharpeners, and visual aids in content  area instruction, and employing dramatic and oral presentations to enhance communication and understanding.  The school  uses a balanced literacy approach to develop literary skills through read alouds, guided reading, phonics instruction and  modeled and shared writing.  ESL students have access to Leap Frog Schoolhouse – Leap Track System which is computer  assisted instruction software designed to remediate and strengthen basic skills.   In addition, our ELLs are assesed with Star  360 a program software which allows  classroom teachers to hone in on the areas they stuggle with academicaly.  PS 115 acknowledges the importance of integrating language and content.  Learning a second language is most effective when  the focus is on using language to learn about a particular topic.  Content area instruction has been supported by the  acquisition of supplemental instructional materials aligned to the New York State Performance Standards and the New York  State Learning Standards and through the development of themes and content topics.  Thematic instruction provides  meaningful vocabulary and grammatical structures.  Students build a foundation of academic language which is enhanced by  exposure to both new and familiar vocabulary.  English is the language of instruction but support in the native language is  provided.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       Star 360 is a computerized data assessment program which assists in the diagnosis of each student's individual needs.This  program monitoring application is paired with accelerated reading comprehension  that is designed to meet the needs of  students along with RtI. Teachers College(TC)  classroom teachers are given professional development by specialist from  Teachers College on how to develop reading and writing skills to student with a basic foundation in content areas,  its in  second year of implementation.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?  We are not planning to discontinue any programs/services for ELLs.           11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Instructional Component:  Our ELL students are required to take Standardized State Exams in English Language Arts,  Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies. First year ELLs are exempt from the English Language Arts State  Exam. While some  of these tests are translated into the children’s native language, not all are.  After analyzing these standardized test results, it  has been determined that many ELL students need additional support in order to meet the promotional standards.    Our Saturday Institute provides such additional support as well as improves English language proficiency in these  students.  Indicators of success include, but are not limited to, increased student English language proficiency as demonstrated  in portfolios, oral communication, written communication, and standardized test scores.    Title III Supplemental instruction in Literacy, Mathematics, Social Studies and Science will be provided to the ELLs (in grades   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74      Kindergarten through Five) who are at the Beginning, Intermediate, or Advanced levels of proficiency in English based on the  results of LAB R and NYSESLAT.  All of our ELL students who achieve proficiency will continue to receive support through our  Saturday Literacy, Mathematics, Social Studies and Science programs at no cost to the Title III Program.    ESL instruction will take place during a Saturday Institute.  The ELL Institute will run for thirteen weeks in four-hour sessions  (from 9:00 A.M.- 1:00 PM).  There will be nine three-hour sessions for Literacy and Mathematics (February through April) and  four four-hour sessions for Science (May).  There will be one certified teacher for each class on grades Kindergarten/One, Two,  Three, Four and Five for Literacy and Mathematics and two certified teachers on grade four for Science.    Instruction will include lessons in Literacy, Mathematics and Science.  It is hoped that through this Institute we will be able to  increase the English proficiency and prepare ELL students for the standardized tests that they are required to take.  All  instruction will be in English.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  NYSESLAT data has indicated that ELL students in second, third and fourth grades performed best on the reading and  writing  sections of the assessment.  With knowledge of this data, the ESL teacher and mainstream teachers have been working  to improve students’ listening and speaking skills.  Our Academic Intervention Services teachers provide additional small group  instruction in reading and writing as well as mathematics and problem solving.  The NYSESLAT data helps teachers plan  programs and differentiate instruction that best meet the needs of ELLs and allows them to group students for targeted  instruction.  Acuity assessments for ELLs in grades three through five have provided teachers with detailed information about students’  strengths and weaknesses and will drive instruction and professional development.    Our computer laboratory teachers implement desktop publishing the use of  with all students in Kindergarten through grade  five.  Students have published many genres of writing through the use of computer word processing.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is facilitated by dual language resource books given to all ELL concentration classes.  Dual language  books and resources are available in the library for students and teachers. The ESL teacher speaks Haitian Creole which is the  native language of the majority of the current ESL population at P.S. 115.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Required support and services are made available to all ELL concentrated classes. Bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, picture  books, dictionaries, audio/visual manipulatives and hands on materials are available in each grade level.  The age and grade  appropriate materials are given to all concentrated classes and the ESL teacher, who provides and coteaches with content area  teachers.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    NYSESLAT data has indicated that ELL students in second, third and fourth grades performed best on the reading and  writing  sections of the assessment.  With knowledge of this data, the ESL teacher and mainstream teachers have been working  to improve students’ listening and speaking skills.  Our Academic Intervention Services teachers provide additional small group  instruction in reading and writing as well as mathematics and problem solving.  The NYSESLAT data helps teachers plan  programs and differentiate instruction that best meet the needs of ELLs and allows them to group students for targeted  instruction.  Acuity assessments for ELLs in grades three through five have provided teachers with detailed information about students’  strengths and weaknesses and will drive instruction and professional development.    Our computer laboratory teachers implement desktop publishing the use of  with all students in Kindergarten through grade  five.

Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Prior to the start of each academic school year, the ESL teacher contacts the parents of newly enrolled ELL students. A meeting  is scheduled to inform parents of ESL programs offered. Orientation of the building is scheduled for the parents and the newly  enrolled students this facilitates transition in a new environment/school which can be difficult for newly enrolled ELLs. Parents  are also informed of the Title III immigrant program and Saturday Institute during the school year.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?     There are no language electives being offered at this time.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not Applicable       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  1. Professional development workshops continue to take place during common prep periods, on Professional Development  Days, and at after-school workshops to enable teachers to better meet the needs of their ELL students.  This professional  Development focuses on strategies to strengthen the English proficiency of English Language Learners.  Teachers are  introduced to activities and suggestions to improve the performance of these students as well as the appreciation of different  cultures and languages.  The ESOL teacher collaborates with the mainstream teachers regarding student progress, curriculum, available ESL materials,  testing concerns and ESL techniques.  The ESOL teacher continues to monitor the progress and language development of those  students who have passed the NYSESLAT.  The mainstream teachers are informed of their students’ status and if necessary,  Academic Intervention Services are provided.    Classroom teachers are often unfamiliar with the techniques and strategies needed to provide additional support for the  English Language Learner.  During the 2017-2018  Academic year the teachers of English Language Learners will participate in  several professional development courses offered by the Department of Education which include, but are not limited to : T.C.  training, Literacy professional development throughout the school year, workshops on the introduction and utilization of ELL  related data.    Upon completion of the Professional Development workshops, teachers will be better equipped to meet the needs of their  students.  Indicators of success are increased use of the techniques, strategies, and materials presented in the Professional  Development workshops as well as increased student English language proficiency as demonstrated in portfolios, oral  communication, written communication, and standardized test scores.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76          3. Our ELLs receive transitional support from the guidance counselor when they leave elementary and transition into  Intermediate School.  The Guidance counselor also engage our fifth grade ELLs in conversations about future career choices.  4. As per “Jose P”, all teachers will receive a minimum of 7.5 hours of ELL training and10 hours of training for teachers with  students with an IEP.  Sign in sheets are maintained as a record of this training.  Teachers will attend Departmental  Professional Development sessions on the following topics:  Small group instruction for ELLs ; ELA/ELL Standard Based  Instruction: Rubrics and Criteria for Success for all Ell students; Guided Reading Groups for ELLs; NYSESLAT/Acuity data  analysis.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Schools must individually meet with the parents or guardians of English language learners at least once a year, in addition to  parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled meetings provided for  parents or guardians, to discuss the goals of the program, their child’s language development progress, their child’s English  language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.     Parental Involvement Component:  Parents are always welcome at P.S. 115.  We encourage all parents to participate in any  and all workshops.  In addition, parent needs are evaluated at Title I and Title III meetings. The Parent Coordinator conducts  workshops throughout the school year as the needs arise. Topics of these meetings include:     • Services that parents can receive from agencies throughout the community and city     • The use of the school website in order to access information     • Accessing and interpreting Acuity information     • The school use of voice messaging services    Our parent workshops take place during school, after school and on Saturdays.  We provide childcare for those parents who  are unable to otherwise attend.  Refreshments are provided.  Several of our teachers are ready and able to translate for many  of those parents who are not English proficient.  We have teachers fluent in Haitian Creole, Spanish and Chinese.  All of our  notices are sent to parents with translations as needed.  We will pay teachers for translation at Parent Workshops from  Translation Services funds.    Title III Parent Involvement will include six two-hour Parent Workshops which will take place on Saturday from 9:30 A.M. to  11:30 A.M. as follows:    January – TBD –    February – TBD –    March – TBD –    April – TBD –                   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Loren Borgese, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 115                                                                              School DBN: 18k115  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      There are a number of ways in which our school assesses the written translation and oral interpretation needs of  our parents to ensure that all parents are provided with appropriate and timely information in a language they  can understand.   • One method of assessment is through the HLIS (Home Language Identification Survey), which all parents of new  admissions to the   school are required to complete during the registration process. The HLIS is printed in a variety of languages and  the parent will receive the   language of choice for proper completion. Our in-house staff interpreters are called upon during the registration  process. At our school, the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81      following languages are identified: Arabic, Chinese/ Cantoneses, Haitian Creole, French,Spanish , Tagalog  andUrdu. We use the interpretation unit of the Department ofEducation for other languages spoken by our  parents. Parents are also given written translation and oral interpretation in their respected languages.   • Another method of assessment is the ATS system that provides information of the primary language of the  students (RHLA).   • The Parent Coordinator at our school is another resource for determining the needs of parents. Calls are made  to the students’ homes   and an assessment can be made as to the need for translation and oral interpretation to better understand an  issue.   • Informal oral communication with parents and teachers also helps us determine the need for our on staff  interpreters or the need for an   interpretation unit.   • Finally attendance at PTA meetings, and through parent conversations and requests, we establish lines of  communication ensuring that   parents are aware and fully understand what is happening in their child’s academic development.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Oral Preferred    Percent Written                            Percent Oral                            Language    Arabic   Haitian Creole   Spanish   Chinese           3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.     n/a          Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          82      Document Name    Month/Frequency Distributed to   How do you plan to translate?

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of a school emergency, P.S. 115 has formed a Crisis team which consists of Administrators, Guidance  counselor, Dean,School nurse, and teachers who speak second languages. The Crises team is trained on specific  strategies to maintain safety in the event of an emergency. The principal also programs a robo-call to inform the  parents and step by step instructions in their native languages to ensure that parents are informed.
