This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of P.S. 46R is that, in harmony with the home and community, all students will attain Common Core  Standards in education that will provide them with the essential knowledge, creative abilities and social development  to become productive citizens.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   PS 46R is a small Pre-Kindergarten through fifth grade Title I elementary school located in the South Beach section of  Staten Island. The school serves a diverse population from low to middle income households. P.S. 46R has 11% English  Language Learners, 33% students with special needs and 72.3% of the students are eligible for free lunch. The school  is committed to being an open and accessible school creating an environment which provides rich experiences and a  spirit of inquiry in all areas of academia. Students are engaged in developing community, societal responsibilities and  philanthropic activities. Parents can easily meet with the principal, assistant principal, and teachers. Staff and  counselors discuss issues and concerns to support all students. The school works in tandem with parents to achieve  student success, meet the Common Core Standards and make sure students are college and career ready. Parents are  involved in decision making policies, advocate for the school, and support activities, events and school programs.   The administration and teachers collaboratively work to develop teaching strategies that motivate and keep children  intellectually engaged and challenged. A solid foundation of knowledge in content areas is designed, based on the  Common Core Standards. The teaching staff provides all students with classroom instruction which meets their  learning needs and strengths. Professional development allows teachers to remain on the cutting edge of changes in  education based on societal needs and projections. During 2018-2019 school year we will deepen our study of  mathematics. P.S. 46R will have one teacher trained in the Algebra 4All methodology. One teacher from grades two,  three and four will attend monthly training conducted by the Field Support Center (FSC) in mathematics. This training  called "Divide and Conquer is designed to a bridge to the Algebra 4All training for the lower grades. P.S. 46R will also  have three days of summer training in mathematics provided by the National Training Network (NTN) We will also  continue the work that has already been started in English Language Arts with the Core Collaborative. Highly qualified  teachers are then able to bring to their students the skills and talents they need to become productive members of  society.    Assessment is an integral component of the educational process used to guide and inform instruction. The school uses  a variety of assessments, both formative and summative, to drive our educational process. Current practices and  differentiated learning strategies are enhanced through assessment data. The work of Paul Bloomberg's Core  Collaborative will be the focal point of strengthening the use of formative assessments. Data will be studied and  curriculum will be adjusted based on student trends. In ELA, teachers will use Goal Book Pathways to monitor  progress towards the CCLS using pre and post assessments. In Mathematics pre and post GoMath unit tests will be  analyzed. Teachers will also use additional assessments, such as periodic assessments in ELA and math, Accelerated  Reader, Accelerated Math, Star Reading, and TC Writing to have multiple sources of data to inform instruction.    The school offers services for students at risk of not meeting the Common Core Standards, ENL students, and Special  Education students. P.S. 46R has a Title III After School Program to afford ENL students additional instruction in  English Language Arts that will be in session from November 2018 until May 2019. Last year P.S. 46R, through a 21st  Century Grant was awarded an after-school program run by the YMCA. This program, still in its infancy, will include  educational support, social and emotional support as well as physical activity and the arts. It will be in session every  day from 2:30-5:30 and is open to 150 students based on varying activities. This program will run everyday from  September to June. P.S. 46R will also offer an after-school tutoring and test prep program for students from grades 1- 5. This program will run on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:30PM - 4:30PM beginning in November and ending in  early May.   PS 46R values the significant role the Arts provide in enhancing the educational achievement and emotional and social  development of all students. As part of the school’s core academic subjects, the teachers, in collaboration with the art  teacher, parents, administration, and community agencies work to provide a sequential and comprehensive arts  program. During the 2018-19 school year Councilman Matteo provided P.S. 46R with an art grant for an after school  program with the Staten Island Children’s Museum. Matteo's after-school art program will continue in the 2018-2019  school year.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Students at P.S. 46R are engaged in community activism and philanthropic endeavors such as the March of Dimes,  Cespino-Russo Post No. 1544, Bread of Life. Through our work with these organizations we teach the children the  meaning of philanthropy, altruism and community service.      In order to grow healthy minds and healthy bodies P.S. 46R was fortunate to receive a PE Works grant for the 2016- 2017, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 school year. This grant helps to monetarily support the school by partially funding a  licensed physical education teacher who works with all of the students on health, nutrition and physical activity. The  teacher also received a grant that created an after school nutrition club and gardening program. The PE teacher  partnered with Reebok to create a morning walking program called "Boox".   The Albert V. Maniscalco School provides a strong foundation for learning, citizenship, and global participation. PS 46R  stays informed of educational trends and types of educational programs and expertise that our students will need to  be college and career ready. P.S. 46R has many strengths to offer to the students. Although P.S. 46R is a small school,  every child feels comfortable and supported by the staff. The staff knows all of the students’ needs and works to  support them. As evidenced by the School Survey, all teachers feel that high expectations are set for students by  administration and staff and the belief is that all students can learn. Teachers trust each other and administration to  do what is best for the school. As evidenced by the Elementary School Quality Snapshot all students were reported as  good on Student Progress on the State English Language Arts Test and Fair on the State Math Test. Also noted on the  Quality Snapshot is that all student progress for English Language Arts and Math was reported as excellent for lowest  performing students. Based on an analysis of the data one weakness is in relation to student achievement. Although  students are making steady progress not enough are achieving a level 3 or 4 on English Language Arts and Math state  tests. On the 2016-2017 State ELA exam 32% of the students scored at or above the state standard. This is a 4.8% gain  in students meeting the standard in ELA when compared to the 2015-2016 State ELA exam. On the 2016-2017 State  Math exam 30% of the students scored at or above grade level. This is a 2.1% gain in students meeting the standard in  math.         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   P.S. 46R has a large special education population. The school has 69 students with special needs. This is 33% of the  school's population. Students are identified as Learning Disabled, Autistic and Emotionally Disturbed. Many of the  students also have social and emotional needs that effect their instructional abilities.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   After analyzing data in relation to student achievement, the staff and the administration of P.S. 46R, will focus on the  formative assessment process to help students to achieve the Common Core Standards. Through collaboratively  developed curriculum maps, unit planning and revision of lessons in ELA, writing and math, teachers and  administrators will reflect upon the impact of the work to decide which items to cut, keep and/or create while  keeping in mind the lens of the standards and instructional shifts. The instructional focus is to engage in a school-wide  initiative to increase growth in reading comprehension, by building a wide range of reading strategies to use across all  content areas.       The 2017-2018 School Quality guide from 2017 to 2018 reported that rigorous instruction was rated 3.35 that was a  1.13 gain from 2017 from 2.21 to 3.35. This was the area that the school showed the most progress. We also  improved in the following areas; Collaborative teaching went from 4.22 in 2017 to 4.32 in 2018, Supportive  environment went from 2.42 in 2017 to 2.72 in 2018, Effective School Leadership went from 3.67 in 2017 to 4.40 in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         2018, Strong Family ties went from 3.75 in 2017 to 3.87 in 2018 and Trust went from 4.41 in 2017 to 4.77 in 2018.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     The staff of P.S. 46R is diligently working to provide students with rigorous instruction aligned to the Common Core  Standards. Teachers and staff continually analyze data of individual students to inform instruction. In analyzing state  testing data in both reading and math, students are making progress however, the majority of the students are still  not meeting the standard, 32% in ELA and 30% in Math. The Elementary School Quality Snapshot revealed that the  lowest performing students in both ELA and Math are making the most progress.    P.S. 46R has many strengths, including an experienced staff that work together to review instruction and provide the  best quality instruction for students. Go Math is utilized to provide rigorous instruction while supplementing where  necessary to meet student needs. This year while we are still using ReadyGen, we are revising curriculum maps, units  and lessons to better meet the needs of our students. We are also implementing the TC Writing Project to improve  student writing. Collaboratively the teachers will work to align ReadyGen and the TC writing Units. During 2018-2019  school year we will deepen our study of mathematics. P.S. 46R will have one teacher trained in the Algebra 4All  methodology. One teacher from grades two, three and four will attend monthly training conducted by the Field  Support Center (FSC) in mathematics. This training called "Divide and Conquer is designed to a bridge to the Algebra  4All training for the lower grades. P.S. 46R will also have three days of summer training in mathematics provided by  the National Training Network (NTN)        In reviewing Advance data , specifically observations, formative and summative assessments, the 2014 - 2015 Quality  Review Report and principal performance observation recommendations, a priority appears to be a need for more  scaffolding, differentiated and rigorous instruction. Although teachers analyze data there is a need for the data to be  more consistent and aligned vertically and horizontally to identify trends, strengths and weaknesses in pedagogy  which will result in increased student performance.       As per the Quality Review the school's area of celebration was rooted in the grade level impact teams that use  structured protocols to identify a problem of practice and collaborate to strengthen their instructional practice which  leads to rigorous instruction.

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other  high-need student subgroups (e.g.,  overage/under-credited, SIFE, STH).   During the 2018 – 2019 school year teachers of all grades  and subjects will work collaboratively with administration,  and each other to improve learning in English Language  Arts and Math for all students. In order to achieve this  goal we will use a strategic comprehensive assessment  system using multiple measures of data. After analyzing  the NYC DOE's June Instructional reports and Item Skills  Analysis. The standard that the city out preformed P.S. 46  was R.L.2 (central message). One such measure will be to  benchmark the school's identified priority standard R.L.2.  School wide it will be measured 4 times a year, using a  common standard assessment from Goalbook Pathways.  Together the findings will be analyzed during our Impact  teams meetings. Teachers will be provided with  professional development on informative and summative  assessments using data to make informed instructional  decisions in ELA, Math, and all content areas. During  common planning and teacher team meetings, teachers  will make necessary adjustments to the curriculum maps,  units and lesson plans, TC Writing and Go Math based on  analysis of student data. A focus on the domain  operations and algebraic thinking will be tracked using  GoMath baseline and benchamarkbenchmark  assessments. Teachers will be using descriptive feedback  using success criteria and rubrics as well as self and peer  assessment. Cycles of learning walks (September- November, December-February and March - June) using a  lesson study protocol will provide data that will be used to  inform discussions and insure pedagogical shifts.   Professional Development will be provided for staff on  strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities and English Language Learners. Staff will be  provided with differentiated methods of instruction to  meet the needs of these students based on formative and  summative assessments.

P.S. 46R is a supportive community school as evidenced by parent and teacher responses on the 2016-2017 School  Quality Guide. The school scored 3.87 in Strong Family and Community Ties, an 3.35 in rigorous instruction, and a 4.77  in trust. The students and parent/guardians know who to go to for support or help. P.S. 46 is a small school and as a  result, the staff is familiar with most of the students, and the students know who to go to for assistance. One of the  weaknesses observed is a lack of relationship skills among students. On the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, teachers  rated classroom behavior at 76%. According to 2018 OORS data there is a need to continue to address the social  emotional needs of our students.

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).      During the 2018-19 school year students will be able to navigate  social interactions appropriately and increase positive  experiences with peers and adults, allowing for increased  engagement within learning, by participating in school-wide  programs such as Sanford Harmony and P.S. 46R STAR (PBIS)  program and Restorative Circles. During the enrichment period  the ENL teacher and cluster teachers will assist in classrooms to  facilitate groups in order to provide support to students. A team  of teachers co- developed the STAR (PBIS) program that focuses  on positive reinforcement for positive behaviors. As part of the  21st century grant counseling services will be for students  identified as in need but not mandated through an IEP.    The teachers, staff and guidance counselor will implement the  Harmony Program, a research based social/emotional teaching  program. The program contains five units of study and five  themes which include, twenty minutes of daily lessons in  diversity and inclusion, empathy and critical thinking,  communication, problem solving and peer relationships.  Teachers and staff involved in the Harmony Program will use the  meet-up and buddy-up strategies so all students including  students with disabilities and English language learners will be  able to participate in this activity. Daily meetings, with a focused  lesson, during a 20 minute Harmony period is set aside for all  classes. This will take place first thing in the morning to set the  tone for the day.   Staff will collaboratively create a positive behavior intervention  system (PBIS). The incentive program is entitled P.S. 46R STAR.  This program is intended to provide positive reinforcement for  positive behaviors. There are behavior rubrics that were co- created by a team of teachers and these rubrics were discussed  with the students and then used to create class rules.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  All of the teachers at P.S.46R are highly qualified teachers. Highly qualified teachers are essential to the academic  success of students and also to their social and emotional development. In supporting and retaining highly qualified  staff PS 46R cultivates a school climate that fosters open communication between staff and administration, shared  decision making and distributed leadership. Teachers work collaboratively and are able to reflect on best practices.  The school provides an atmosphere where teachers feel valued and are encouraged to implement and customize  learning to meet their teaching style and the needs of their students. P.S. 46R identifies substitute teachers that have  demonstrated potential and cultivates them by making these substitute teachers preferred substitutes for the school.  We then include them in our professional learning opportunities. Thus if a position becomes available we teachers  who are familiar with our best practices and school expectations. We have a licensed Physical Education teacher and  Arts teacher to provided out of classroom classes to the students.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   PS 46R conducts high quality professional development provided by on site by the and off site staff developers, and  SETSS/IEP teacher to ensure that the latest methodologies are explored. Paraprofessionals will be included in The  administration, and SETSS/IEP teacher offer support in implementation and understanding citywide instructional  expectations, the Common Core Standards, and the Danielson Rubric for Teacher Evaluation. All staff is committed to  working together to help all students meet the school’s instructional goals. Professional development is interactive  and collaborative, allowing teachers to question and drive the conversations as well as take leadership roles in  developing curriculum. Teachers will participate in delivering professional development on Mondays and Tuesday  professional learning times based on observation of strengths as evidenced through the Danielson Rubric for  teaching. The Principal and Assistant Principal attend Principal and Assistant Principal learning groups monthly. Inter- visitations among cohorts of Principals and Assistant principals are ongoing through out the year in order to build best  practices and a theory of action around a problem of practice. Partnerships with The Core Collaborative are ongoing  to support teachers in developing learning intentions and success criteria around learning standards in order to have  better clarity for the students. Beginning in the 2018-2019 school year we will be receiving professional development  in Algebra 4All and in Divide and Conquer. In addition the work supports the school initiative of formative assessment,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      so that students are assessed though-out a unit and instruction is tailored to providing entry points to English  Language Learners and Students with Disabilities.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  The transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary school  program are coordinated by the school principal, kindergarten teachers and the parent coordinator. Pre K students  from local CBOs visit the school to see the kindergarten classrooms before they officially enter the elementary school.  Parent meetings are held for incoming kindergarten students in the spring to allow parents to meet the staff and learn  about the school and allow the incoming students to see the school.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate multiple  assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to improve  instruction is an ongoing process. Teachers, staff developer and administration routinely review assessment options  to make informed decisions regarding choice of assessments and the link to curriculum and instruction. Professional  development is then conducted on the chosen assessments and how to analyze and use the data to inform  instruction. Analysis of the results of the assessments are reviewed and discussed during professional development.  Teachers are encouraged to share results and are also encouraged to make suggestions to drive professional  development.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40        Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The Albert V. Maniscalco School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children.

The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   P.S. 46 only became a Community School in the spring of 2017 and has only had a Community School Director since  September of 2017. We are currently working together to optimize the after school program. We are also working on  parent involvement activities together as well as ways to integrate the Community School strategy into the  instructional program.      Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    Throughout the 2018-2019 school year the Community School will support academic growth by providing assistance  to students attending the after school program. They will ensure that homework is completed every day and students  in grades 3-5 will be assisted with state test preparation. By June 100% of the students attending the after school  program will complete homework 100% of the time and students in grades 3-5 will increase their state test scores by  10%.          Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  Our community school goals in expanded learning time, attendance support, family engagement, and health and  wellness will support our academic goals for students by allowing us to work together to move these goals forward.  The after school program will support academics and provide a safe place for students after school to continue their  social emotional growth. Weekly attendance meetings will help to track students in danger of becoming chronically  absent or late and provide support to families who have attendance issues.

Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following:  1.   Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and  together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will  lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   2.   3.   4.   1.

We will work together to brings programs and services to the students not only in  the after-school but also in the day school.   2. The most important way to personalize the needs of all students, through ELT, and mental health programming is  communication. All school staff and all YMCA staff must be aligned in order for there to be success. Students will be  discussed at weekly meetings to ensure that they are getting the services they need. Programs provided by the YMCA  will be routinely analyzed to ensure they are appropriate for our needs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      3.

After closely looking at the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, and ELA scores instruction for the  Title III Program is designed to develop skills in comprehension, speaking, and writing in  English through the integration of academic content appropriate for the students' age, level, and  English skills.Supplemental instruction for English Language Learners is needed in order to  improve overall student achievement to meet the Common Core Learning Standards. An analysis  of running records, NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, and ELA scores have exhibited a need for  supplemental instruction to increase the number of students reaching proficiency in English.    The total student enrollment at Public School 46 is currently 270 students in grades kindergarten  through grade five of which 36 are English Language Learners. Supplemental instruction in the  Title III After School Program at Public School 46 will be provided in English by the one  certified ENL teacher. In addition, native language support will be provided through the  implementation of bilingual books, picture dictionaries, and picture cards. The Title III After  School Program will be based on Brain Pop ESL,  Reading A-Z Enhanced ELL Reading  Solution, and Science A-Z. Funds from the Title III program will be used to purchase these  programs. The program cost for both is 504.10. In addition, Title III funds will be used to  purchase Ipads (367.00) for the students and  subscriptions to Highlights for Kids and High Five  Bilingue Magazine. All of the above mentioned programs are supplemental and will be only used  during the After School Title III Program.  P.S. 46's plan will include a Title III After School Program for grades 1-5. The after school  program will be on Wednesdays 2:21-4:21 and Thursdays 2:21-4:21.There will be two groups.  Grades 1 and 2 will be grouped together and grades 3,4, &5 will be grouped together. The after  school sessions will run from November 13 until April 30 for a total of 37 sessions. In addition,  there will be 15 hours of planning time. Student attendance scan sheets are completed by the  ENL teacher and then given to the school secretary. One copy is maintained in the main office  and one is also also kept by the ENL teacher. Program notifications letters in both English and  the parents preferred language are kept in the office and also by the ENL teacher. One certified  ENL teacher will provide instruction to all beginning and intermediate ELLs.Students will be  grouped by language proficiency levels and by grade. As new ELLs enter our school we will  include them as participants into the Title III Supplemental Program.The two target groups are  being kept small in order to facilitate an increase in learning.The supervisor in charge of the  program is the principal of P.S. 46, Andrea Maffeo.The supervisor will be responsible for any  issues that arise during the program, for example, behavioral issues, sick child, observing  teacher, etc. The supervisor's official  work day is from 7:00-2:50. The supervisor's hours for the  Title III Program will be 2:55-4:30.The supervisor will be compensated using Title III funds. She  will be responsible for staying with children after the official end time of the program and  contacting the parents of children who are not picked up on time.  Reading A-Z Enhanced ELL Reading Solution, provides content-based and thematic based texts  and visuals focused on developing speaking, listening, writing, and reading skills in both social  and academic contexts.

Native language support in Spanish is provided. In addition, parents have access to student  progress and can check their child's reading progress. Brain Pop ESL will also be implemented  in the After School Title III Program.This technology software website will enhance student  writing skills, reading comprehension, encourage independent learning, as well as provide a  home-school connection for our families. Additionally, Highlights for Kids and High Five  Bilingue Magazines will help build academic vocabulary and acquire idioms and expressions  while providing native language support in Spanish to English Language Learners. In addition,  during the Title III program Ells will be provided with the opportunity to engage in cooking  lessons. These lessons will aide ELLs in becoming better equipped in reading and following  recipes, practicing measuring different ingredients, and having the satisfaction of being able to  create something independently.

Public School 46 will engage  the parents of English Language Learners in order to foster higher achievement for ELLs and to  create a culture of success within our school community. Parents are invited to attend PTA  meetings. Translators are provided during such meetings. Parents of English Language Learners  are also invited to attend the following school activities which are offered on a monthly  basis:New Family Welcome,Health and Wellness Information Night, Movie Night, Read for the  Record Day,March of Dimes Fall Festival, Literacy Pajama Night, Adopt a Soldier Packing  Party,Nutrition Club, Gardening Party, Dance festival, and Family Fun Night. All of these events  and workshops are run by the Parent Coordinator, Sara Cottone and staff members. Invitiation  letters for all parent involvement activities are translated into the child's native language and sent  home. Agendas and attendance sheets from these meetings and workshops are maintained in the  main office. All of the above mentioned activities will help foster a culture of success. ELL  parental involvement in these activities will enhance the child's self-esteem, improve their  academic achievement, improve parent-child relationships, help parents develop positive  attitudes towards school, and a better understanding of the schooling process.This interactive  time where children and their parents are fully engaged with one another can help parents learn  more about their child's strengths and weaknesses in all aspects of their lives.  Bilingual Family Literacy Tea will be hosted during the After School Title III program for  parents of ELLs by out certified ENL teacher.This event will be held on December 12 and  December 13, 2018 at 3:30 to 4:21.  This is to provide parents with opportunities to read to their  children in their native language. Adults and children are allowed time and space to read  together. They will be able to create their own special bookmark as they enjoy some  refreshments. This event will offer parents the opportunity to meet other parents, show their  children the importance of reading and learn how to support reading development at home. Also,  the ENL teacher will provide a workshop for the parents of ELLs in November for 45 minutes on  Literacy and Language APPs during the After school Title III Program. During the workshop  parents will be shown how to use the Apps on an Ipad. Translators will be provided. A copy of  all agendas, attendance sheets, and invitations in parents' preferred languages will be kept in the  main office and one copy will be kept by the ENL teacher.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?   P. 46 utilizes the following assessment tools to assess the early literacy of ELLs: running records, TCRWP for grades K-2,  Performance Series Computerized Assessments in reading, Monitoring for Results to chart progress, Accelerated Reader,  Accelerated Math, STAR Reading, TC Writing, and Dibels.The data collected from the assessments aids in driving ENL  instruction. After closely looking at data, it demonstrates that much more scaffolding and support is needed in order to  provide ELLs with the proper assistance. The ENL teachers and the classroom teacher work closely together to implement  Reading and Literacy instruction using the Danielson  Framework and research based intervention strategies focusing on  specific learning targets.According to TCRWP Assessment Pro as of June 2018, ELLs have reached Benchmark Reading Levels of  1 and 2 in grades K-2. Due to these findings, more emphasis will be placed on guided reading, and small group instruction  during the Harmony period. According to the Accelerated Math Data as of June 2018, ELLs have made minimal progress on  math problems. The ENL teachers will continue to work on making lessons comprehensible and ensure that students have the  language to understand instruction and express their grasp of math concepts orally and in writing. ELL Math instruction will   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      include the use of vocabulary banks, manipulatives, nonverbal responses, sentence frames, sufficient wait time, re-teach, and  questions and prompts for different proficiency levels.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The following structures are in place to support ELLs using formative assessments to guide instructional planning for  ELLs:Classroom teachers and ENL teachers keep portfolios of student wrting samples to show individual student growth over  time which are used during parent-teacher conferences and also during impact meetings. Also,  teacher-evaluation  checklists  are kept that focus on how classroom teachers and ENL teachers scaffold and support core content learning and  academic language development for their students.School leadership ensures that the ENL teachers have the results of the  NYSESLAT at the beginning of the academic school year during the first day of professional development. All teacher teams  meet and analyze data pertaining to all students. After analyzing data, teachers are able to form groups in the classroom to  better assist ELLs. In addition, school leadership provides all exam results to all staff members at the beginning of the school  year.In order to develop a schoolwide understanding of misconceptions educators decide what data is useful in driving  instruction to improve student achievement. Next steps are also created in addition to goals that are data driven, actionable,  and measurable. Student work is constantly reviewed to adjust curriculum on the needs of ELLs.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  After looking at the most current NYSESLAT scores most ELLs have met annual yearly progress and have moved up in  proficiency levels across all the four modalities. Overall, after analyzing all assessments given to ELLs ranging from the  NYSESLAT to state exams, we have seen an improvement in reading comprehension skills in ELLs. P.S. 46 evaluates the success  of our programs by closely monitoring this progress made by ELLs. The ENL program at P.S. is aligned and works effectively to  facilitate the acquisition of the English language and academic achievement. It is  based on educational theory for ELLs and is  adjusted where needed to ensure language barriers are overcome. It ensures that ELLs are progressing in English proficiency  and are attaining English. It is aligned to Common Core State Standards, the New Language Arts Progressions, and there has  been an increase in academic rigor. There is an ongoing evaluation  of the program and to make sure all needs of  ELLs are  being met. The school has made annual yearly progress which is evident in the NYSESLAT results. After looking closely at the  data from the NYSESLAT, most students have improved somewhat on all parts of the NYSESLAT.  They have also made progress  in the classroom. Both their BICS and CALP have improved.The ELL Periodic Assessment is being used with ELLs as a baseline to  identify progress and areas of need. After results are analyzed, the ENL teachers are able to align assessment with learning  objectives for ELLs in order to drive instruction. The data helps decide student groups, create seating charts, and differentiate  for ELLs.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered the ENL teachers and classroom teachers  develop instructional activities that are  geared to ELLs' current  level of English proficiency. After it is analyzed, the ENL teachers compare it against the New Language  Progressions and the Common Core State Standards. In addition, this data helps inform student groups, and differentiating for  ELLs.  There are various structures in place to address interventions based on summative data. Once universal screenings are  administered at the beginning of the year to evaluate progress teacher teams meet to analyze student performance and to  monitor progress of all students.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   P. S. 46 uses data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention Framework. Universal screening is  administered to all students. The information gathered from the Home Language Identification Survey informs both the ENL  teacher and the classroom teacher of what factors influence the ELL learning process. The screening process assesses the  child's literacy skills and competencies. In addition, it allows us to see whether or not ELLs are meeting grade level  benchmarks.  P.S. 46 utilizes the following interventions to support ELLs: screening and formative assessment to identify  students at risks for poor learning, progress monitoring, and the implementation of multi-level evidence- based instruction  that is matched to students' instructional needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Data patterns across proficiency levels and grades consistantly show that ELLs struggle mostly in the areas of both writing and  speaking on the NYSESLAT. After looking at NYSITELL data most Kindergarten ELLs have reached a proficiency score of  expanding.  Whereas, by first grade ELLs either remain at transitioning level or have achieved a proficiency level of expanding  showing considerable growth. Overall, it is the ENL teacher's findings that the kindergarten ELLs scored lowest on the speaking  section of the NYSITELL. Due to these findings, more emphasis will be placed on Oral Language Development.  Upon reviewing  the NYSESLAT data, all grade first through fifth grade ELLs excel mostly in the listening and reading components of the  NYSESLAT. Instead the writing component is an area where ELLs struggle and have not made sufficient progress. P.S. 46  evaluates data from the RLAT in ATS. The data demonstrates that SWD ELLs struggle in Math and have made progress in ELA  and general education ELLs have made progress on the ELA and have stayed the same in Math. In grade 4, most students  made progress in both ELA and MATH. In grade 5, most students have made progress in ELA and SWD ELLS still struggle in  Math.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?       After carefully analyzing the data, both ENL teachers create lessons and align curriculum maps to meet the needs of ELLs  during common prep periods. In addition, the ENL program is aligned to the New Language Arts Progressions in order to meet  discipline-specific standards in K-12 across all four modalities (listening, speaking, reading, and writing). School leadership and  staff routinely examine the results of the NYSESLAT to identify trends. The results show most ELLs scoring at an Advanced level  of proficiency and all students have made progress.   This year most of the students passed the NYSITELL. The NYSITELL data is  shared with staff and used to drive instruction. In addition the SPANISH LAB helps us identify ELLs who might struggle in their  native language.   After accessing the ATS codes, school leadership and ENL teachers meet to discuss results.  Student work is  reviewed weekly during impact meetings.  Teachers assign, re-teach or enrich sessions for the following week.              Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   PS 46 is currently  using both a stand alone model of instruction and an intergrated model of instruction in order to  service our ELL population. Each period is 45 minutes in duration. The groups are no larger than twelve children. The  English Language Learners are grouped heterogeneously and no more than two contiguous grades are grouped  together. All entering and emerging ELLs receive 360 minutes  of both standalone and integrated ENL/ELA instruction.  All transitioning and expanding ELLs receive 180 of integrated ENL/ELA instruction.  All commanding ELLs receive 90  minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction. During the standalone model of instruction, the ENL teacher utilizes ESL  methodologies to teach her ELLs. Her lessons are aligned to classroom teachers and to the Common Core State  Standards. All instruction is in English with material made readily available in the child's home language. Whereas, in  the integrated model of instruction, the ENL teacher co-teaches with the classroom teacher. The ENL teachers  scaffold all instruction to all students in the classroom.ELA and ENL is delivered during the free standing ENL program  to ensure mandated minutes are provided. During the freestanding ENL program students receive the NYS mandated  ENL/ELA allotted instruction time based on students' proficiency level. School leadership reviews teachers' programs   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         and schedules to ensure the number of mandated instructional minutes of ENL and ELA is in accordance with CR PART  154 mandates.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     At this time, P.S. 46 does not offer a transitional bilingual education program.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.       At this time, P.S. 46 does not offer a dual language program.    2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   As per CR Part 154 , all ELLs receive language arts instruction in English as a New Language , in English Language Arts, and in  Home Language Arts. Entering ELLs receive 1 unit of study in ENL,  and 1 unit of of study in ENL/ELA. Emerging ELLs receive .5  unit of study in ENL, 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA, and .5 unit of study in STANDALONE  ENL  or  INTERGRATED ENL/Content Area.  All transitioning ELLs receive .5 unit of study in ENL/ELA and .5 unit of study in STANDALONE ENL. All expanding ELLs receive 1  unit of study in ENL/ELA. All commanding ELLs receive .5 unit of study of intergrated ENL in ELA.P.S. 46 places all ELLs in one  class per grade. This allows the ENL teaches to service their ELLs. School leadership reviews all scheduling and programming  to  ensure ELLs are being serviced in both the freestanding model and integrated model of instruction.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   P.S. 46 offers a freestanding English as a New Language program.  It is aligned with Ready Gen, the Common Core State  Standards, the instructional shifts, and the New Language Arts Progressions. More emphasize is placed on informational texts  focused on Science and Social Studies. In addition, higher order thinking skills and academic vocabulary is being fostered. In  order to improve ELL performance on content area examinations the ENL and classroom teachers scaffold academic language  to support students' participation in content areas. Instruction is also aligned to Common Core State Standards.The language  of instruction is English throughout the content areas. Teachers provide comprehensive input and use instructional scaffolding  strategies to assist learners to develop new understandings, concepts, abilities, and build upon prior knowledge.Teaching  materials include a wide range of print, visuals, and manipulatives designed for increasing English Language Proficiency. The  Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach (CALLA) is implemented for meeting the academic needs of ELLs with its  focus of instruction being content subjects.  The SIOP Model (Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol) is also used to  shelter and support ELLs in grade-level content courses such as social studies, and science. Emphasis is placed on acquisition of  academic language and skills while building on students' prior experiences. The SIOP Model of instruction makes content  comprehensible for English Language Learners. The Balanced Literacy instructional approaches are implemented on a daily  basis through the use of modeled writing, shared writing, guided reading, and independent reading. The Total Physical  Response Approach is utilized with the beginning ELLs in order to teach language through physical, motor activity. The four  skills of listening, speaking reading, and writing are approached from a communicative perspective. Authentic, real life  materials such as magazines, newspapers, graphs, charts, and Ipads are used in the classrooms. Cooperative learning is also  used in order to provide opportunities for second language acquisition through the use of interactive pair work and group  activities. Instructional scaffolding, such as graphic organizers, is used in the classroom providing temporary support structures  that assist learners to develop new understandings, concepts and abilities. All the strategies implemented in the ENL program  help ELLs meet grade level standards. Throughout the academic year, students are offered additional classes in preparation for  testing in grades third, fourth, and fifth. Rigby's On our Way to English and Scott Foresman ESL textbooks, workbooks, and  charts help to support oral language development and literacy learning through the content area. In addition, the ENL teacher  will meet once a month with classroom teachers and the Science teacher to work on implementing strategies that will help  ELLs with specific Math and Science concepts and terminology..    .       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      P.S. 46 currently administers the Spanish Lab to all new Spanish speaking entrants. In addition,  P.S. 46 will begin administering  the LENS to all prospective SIFE students. In addition, the ENL teachers  will arrange for a speaker of the child's home language  to conduct an informal assessment of the student's first language throughout the year.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    P.S. 46 does not have any SIFE students at this time.  However, the following procedures would be put in place if we were to  have any potential SIFE students.  Potential SIFE students would be administered the NYSED ORAL interview questionnaire  Mulitlingual Literacy SIFE screener and Writing Screening tools which are found on the NYSED website as per CR PART 154.2- 3.  P.S. 46 would also utilize the Newcomer Toolkit found on the NYSED website when newcomers arrive to our  school.  Parents of newcomers are consulted to determine the extent of education in the language and their previous  exposure to English.  Peer language buddies and learning leaders are assigned to further assist newcomers.     P.S. 46 ensures that all ELLs are appropriately evaluated in all four modalities throughout the year. The ENL teachers provide  practice for ELLs in preparation for the NYSESLAT.   Children are being evaluated both informally and formally throughout the  school year. The focus of instruction is placed on oral language academic proficiency. It is also aligned with READY  GEN  Reading and Writing components.     P.S 46 does not currently have any SIFE students. However, if in the future we were  to acquire SIFE students, P.S. 46 would implement a Saturday morning program, and an after school program.  Newcomer ELLs are given three periods of ESL a day for the first few months of the academic school year.  They are also  provided with bilingual dictionaries and peer tutoring in their native language.  ELLs receiving services for 4 to 6 years are  provided with Academic Intervention Services (AIS). These services are as follows: Saturday Test Prep Academy , small group  instruction and for grades 3-5 AIS and a Title III after school program.    Long-term ELLs have been provided (and will continue to be provided) with additional help as needed, such as after school test  prep programs. AIS services are given to help transition students reaching proficiency. Accelerated Math also provides  teachers with continuous feedback to personalize instruction while enabling students to practice their math skills at their own  individual levels. GO Math lessons support students acquiring proficiency in English because the program incorporates many  proven strategies that help linguistically diverse students. These hands on programs develop concepts and skills through the  use of concrete materials, and places a great emphasis on habits of communication.  The ENL teachers  work closely with all Special Education teachers.  The Special Education ELLs who are mandated to receive  ENL services as per their IEP are serviced by the two full time certified ENL teachers. They all receive services according to their  NYSESLAT scores.   The ENL teachers provide continuing transitional support for ELLs reaching proficiency on the NYSESLAT. They carefully  scaffold instruction increasing academic language development through the content areas assisting them in grade level tasks.  The ENL teachers provide rigorous learning opportunities for ELLs to foster higher order thinking skills.   Former ELLs are given 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction. In addition, former ELLs are given testing  accommodations for up to two years after testing out of an ENL program.   ELL students reaching proficiency are provided AIS services and are also offered after school ENL program. The ELL after school  program is used to strengthen Math and Literacy development using ESL methodologies. The program utilizes Phonics Builds  Better Readers by Zaner-Bloser, which follows a balanced "whole-part-whole" instructional plan that makes phonics  meaningful within  the context of literacy development. It focuses on visual discrimination, oral language, and listening skills.  In addition, Learning A-Z's Enhanced ELL Reading Solution is used to address the Common Core State Standards' goal  to  provide ELLs, of all proficiency levels, the opportunity to gain content-area knowledge. The after school program is also a test  prep program preparing ELLs for the fully aligned Common Core State Standards  NYSESLAT. The teacher uses Getting Ready  for the NYSESLAT and Beyond by Attanasio and Associates, Inc. The English Language Learners are provided with the skills to  become familiar with the structure of the NYSESLAT and in their development of essential language proficiencies in listening,  speaking, reading, and writing.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The ENL teachers align their program to Ready Gen with all ELLs using  scaffolding strategies that are part of the Ready Gen  program. In doing so, the students are being taught on grade level. Instructional strategies  focus on academic vocabulary.P. S.  46 ensures ELL-SWDs receive all services mandated on their IEPs. During PPT meetings, the ENL teacher and the Related  Service Provider work closely together to look at IEPs to ensure all ELLs are receiving all necessary services. Award Reading is  used with all ELLs in each subgroup and ELLs with SWDs. It is a common-core driven instruction using technology to extend  instruction fostering fluency. It includes print concepts and phonics to more complex skill development differentiated  instruction for ELL students in order to accelerate English Language Acquisition. Native language materials used are bilingual  dictionaries and and books.  In addition, Raz-Kids ELL Component, Science Spin and Storyworks Scholastic Magazines are used  to assist ELLs in all of the core content areas of instruction.                                                                                                           7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  P.S. 46  uses scheduling flexibility to enable diverse ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and to attain English proficiency. The  ENL teachers and service providers work closely together to align scheduling and instruction for the child.  The ELLs are also  provided with additional instruction during Harmony period ( a social emotional program) by providing push in service. The  focus during this time is on oral language development.  P.S. 46 ensures that flexible programming is used to maximize time  spent with non-disabled peers by closely looking at data regarding benchmarks being met by a child. If a child meets a  benchmark in a particular content area the child is then mainstreamed into a general education class for that particular  content area class. ELL-SWDs are initially placed in the least restrictive class such as ICT. This allows the individual ELL not to be  pulled out of class too frequently.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  P.S. 46 utilizes Periodic Assessments, TCRWP, Accelerated Math and Reading to analyze data  to drive instruction and to assist  in goal setting. The ENL teachers and the classroom teacher are able to identify problematic areas for ELLs. After analyzing the  data we noticed that ELLs seems to be struggling most with higher order thinking skills. Patterns across proficiency levels for all  grades demonstrate that ELLs have consistently scored lowest in writing and speaking. Due to these findings, English as a  Second Language Instruction is designed to develop skills in comprehension, speaking, and writing in English through the  integration of academic content appropriate for the students' age, level, and English skills.The ENL teachers  and classroom  teachers articulate and work closely together on a daily basis to deliver literacy instruction to meet the needs of ELLs. In  addition, the Balanced Literacy Approach is implemented with ELLs encouraging students to discuss their ideas, work with a  partner or group in revising, editing, and interacting verbally with their peers. It also addresses the needs of our ELL population  by providing them with ongoing opportunities to read, write, and speak in order to help them gain fluency. The ENL teachers  carefully analyze the data from the NYSESLAT and the ELL Periodic Assessment. After thoroughly looking at the four modalities  of speaking, listening, reading, and writing, the ENL teachers are able to drive instruction. They also articulate with the  classroom teacher making her aware of what areas the student might have deficits.  The school has learned a great deal from  reviewing the data from both the ELL Periodic Assessment and the NYSESLAT. Our findings are as follows: there needs to be an  increase in the teaching figurative language, an increase in academic language, and an emphasis on informational texts, text  complexity, and more engaging tasks for ELLs.Public 46 utilizes Go Math in grades K-5. All teachers set goals for all students  including ELLs based on data from pre-unit tests in Go Math. Grade level inquiry teams analyze and make recommendations  for differentiated instruction within the classroom. In analyzing mathematics performances through formative and summative  assessments in grades K-5 and on the Mathematics State testing data for grades 3-5 we have noted that more rigorous tasks  aligned with Common Core State Standards are being implemented with ELLs.                9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      There have been  changes made to the ENL program. Alls ELLs are given both stand alone and intergrated instruction. It is  become more aligned to Common Core State Standards, and to the New Language Arts Progressions. ELLs are placed in the  same classrooms on each grade. Thus, allowing the ENL teachers  the opportunity of using an integrated  model of instruction.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?    There will not be any programs discontinued for ELLs.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.ELLs are invited to attend all after school and supplemental programs  at P.S. 46. ELLs are also invited to attend Saturday Test Prep Programs, Title III After School Program,  student government, and  all other student activities providing them with translation assistance when needed. All letters of notifications are sent home in  both English and the child's home language. ELLs participate fully in all programs. They are given the same opportunities as  other all other students in deciding whether or not to participate in an after school program, for example, ELLs are invited to  attend the Virtual Y After School Program offered every day after school. This program provides homework  help  and fosters  oral language development for all ELLs.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The ENL teachers scaffold instruction through modeling, questioning, feedback, and graphic organizers providing the necessary  support for ELLs. The ELLs are also provided with English at Your Command by Hampton-Brown. This is designed to build  vocabulary skills in writing, grammar, mechanics and communication. They are also provided with Rigby Great Strides Critical  Thinking Skills and Inferential Skills enabling students to understand cause and effect and reading between the lines in  fiction.  Award Reading Program, a technology based literacy program , is used with all ELLs. This program assists ELLs with  academic vocabulary and  informational texts. In addition, Learning A-Z Enhanced ELL reading Solution  is utilized which assists  with Universal Design for Learning (UDL)..The ENL teachers  use Lakeshore Science Kits with ELLs to promote academic  vocabulary. These science kits also provide ELLs with the necessary hands-on experience to master scientific concepts. In  addition to this, the ENL teachers use Clearly Social Studies by Frank Schaffer Publications, with all ELLs. Clearly Social Studies is  aligned to state and national standards promoting academic vocabulary. Lastly, the ENL teachers  utilize Scholastic classroom  magazines with ELLs. Let's Find out, Storyworks, Science Spin, and Super Science with grades K-5. These magazines assists ELLs  in allowing the children to view non fiction videos, listen to articles being read aloud as words are highlighted one by  one.  They are also available in Spanish for Home Language support.Go Math, Accelerated Math,and Mathemats are used with  all students including ELLs in grade kindergarten through fifth. In addition, students are provided with bilingual math  glossaries.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   P.S. 46 offers native language support for all ELLs. Multicultual and bilingual books are made readily available in the ENL  classroom. Bilingual glossaries and bilingual picture dictionaries are given to all ELLs. Peer tutoring is provided during lunch  periods for ELLs.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    School leadership ensures that all core subjects are provided for ELLs.  ELL programs and schedules are reviewed by school  leadership making sure that ELLs are given all subjects made available to all other students.  The ENL program is aligned to the  Common Core State Standards and the New Language Arts Progressions. The ENL program is designed to reinforce what the  children are learning in the classroom. It is aligned to Ready Gen in grades K-5. An emphasis is placed on informational non- fiction reading and writing with all ELLs.The ENL teachers closely look at student's IEP  to correspond to their ages and grades  while, being appropriate to their cognitive needs. The ENL teachers use a comprehensive plan of instruction based on best  practices for students with learning difficulties.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We do not have a building co-location.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   P.S. 46 supports newly enrolled ELLs. Each child is given a welcome kit with teacher information, bussing information, school  website, school calendar, and  community resources. In addition they are given grade level support materials such as picture  bilingual dictionaries, bilingual books, and school supplies.  Transitional support is offered from Pre-K to Kindergarten and from fifth Grade to middle school by the Parent Coordinator,  Sara Cottone and our guidance counselor Pam Rosenfeld.  At this time, we do not offer a summer program for newly admitted ELLs.  New ELLs who are admitted throughout the school  year are provided with  three periods of ENL per day.  In addition, the ENL teacher sets up peer -tutoring for ELLs during their  lunch periods.  P. S. 46 supplies newly arrived ELLs with school information and other supplies that will contribute to an ELLs  success and feeling comfortable at P.S.46. They are assigned a peer who speaks their native language. This student takes the  newcomer on a tour of the school  and sits with the child during his or her lunch period.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    P.S. 46 is working on implementing language electives for the upcoming school year.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?    P.S.46 does not currently have a dual language program.         Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The Assistant Principal, Tara Forde maintains agendas and attendance from professional development offered to all staff  members at P.S. 46.  The ENL teachers have attended and will continue to attend all professional learning opportunities  provided by the Department of English Language Learners and Student Support. In addition, The ENL teachers  have been  provided with professional development  for both Imagine Learning and Learning A-Z Enhanced ELL Reading Solution.  Additional  professional development will include and is given not only to the ENL teachers but all staff members including  teachers, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, special education teachers, psychologists, speech therapists, occupational  therapists, physical therapists, secretaries, and parent coordinators: The following professional learning will be conducted  during the school year:  September-The 4 Tenets of Student Learning, October-The Formative Assessment Process, November- Unpacking the Standards, December-Responsive Conferring Prompts to Support and Scaffold Writers, January-Comprehension  Strategies, February-Close Reading and Connections to the Common Core State Standards, March-Using Data to Improve  Learning of All Students, April-Analyzing Running Records, May-Reading Standards for Informational Texts, LAP and Language  and Interpretation Plan. All of the above mentioned professional learning sessions will have an ENL component. All teachers of  ELLs are offered support in utilizing the Common Core State Learning Standards. The professional development is provided by  the Assistant Principal and IEP teacher at P.S. 46. During common preps, grade team members and the ENL teachers meet on a  weekly basis preparing lessons , looking closely at the grade level standards, and discussing scaffolding strategies for ELLS.  In  addition, teachers of ELLs are made aware and given the opportunity to attend any workshops offered by the Division of  English Language Learners and Student Support and the Borough Field Support Center. Specifically, the ENL teacher has  attended the workshops on the following topics: ELL Data Analysis Tool(EDAT), NYSESLAT Training, Instructional Implications of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65         the New Service Delivery for English Language Learners,  Oral Language Development, SIOP Workshop, LAP Technical  Assistance Training, and Reflective Practice Teaching Series.      2.

These professional development hours are based on language  acquisition, a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and content instruction for English Language Learners.In  addition, the ENL teacher is given the opportunity to frequent all workshops provided by the Department of English Language  Learners and Student Support. These professional learning opportunities allow the ENL teacher to meet the minimum  requirement of 50%  total hours of professional development in language acquisition in alignment with core content area  instruction, best practices for co-teaching strategies and inter-grating language and content instruction for ELLs. Records of  attendance and agendas are kept in the teacher's file.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   P.S. 46 provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs.  Every Tuesday afternoon from 2:20-3:00, the ENL teachers  will meet with the parents of ELLs individually  to discuss the student's language development progress, English language  proficiency assessment results, and their language development needs in all content areas. If the parents are not able to  attend, then a telephone conference will  be conducted and a record of this will be kept on ilog in ATS.  Interpreters are  provided for parents when needed through the Translation Unit. The ENL teachers maintain records of these meetings. A copy  of all sign-in sheets, agendas, and handouts are kept on file in a binder. Evidence of telephone conferences will be kept on ilog  in ATS. The Translation Unit is utilized when there are no in-house translators available.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The education of children is a collaborative effort between school and family. P. S. 46 strives to develop a close partnership  with parents and community members.  We encourage this development as a way to broaden our students' educational  experience and strengthen support and participation in all areas of our school. The Parent Coordinator assigned to our school  pays particular attention to parents of ELLs. The needs of parents are usually evaluated through simple discussions with the  both parents and the school social worker. Parent Orientation meetings are held periodically during the school year as new  children arrive. The parents are shown the online parent video in their native language  addressing parent options in several  languages. All parents are given the opportunity to become familiar with various programs offered in our school by way of the  PTA meetings, orientation nights, conferences, workshops, and letters sent home in their native language. Some activities that  ELL parents are invited to attend are: Literacy Pajama Night,  Dance Festival, Movie Night, and Rhyme Time Night. In addition,  parent workshops are offered to parents of ELLs ranging from homework help to how to help your child succeed on the  NYSESLAT.   In addition, Community Organizations are made available to parents of ELLs.  P.S. 46 offers the Virtual Y After  School Program.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Albert V.
