This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      The Urban Assembly School for the Performing Arts (UASPA) aims to sustain a challenging college-preparatory  curriculum that infuses the performing Arts into all aspects of the academic experience. By using the Arts as a  teaching tool and providing students with the means to express themselves, UASPA will breathe life and confidence  into all members of our school community. We will use the cultural and professional resources of New York City to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      ensure that students receive a rigorous education which exceeds state standards, are successful in earning a college  degree, and have a vision for what their future holds.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The Urban Assembly School for the Performing Arts (UASPA) engages students in college-preparatory curricula that  infuses the performing arts into all aspects of the academic experience. By using the arts as a teaching tool and  providing students with means to express themselves, UASPA breathes life and creativity into all subjects and builds  confidence in all members of our school community. At UASPA, we believe that all students deserve access to a  rigorous academic and artistic high school experience; therefore, we do not screen or audition our students and we  attract students from all five boroughs of New York City, who may not have had previous access to artistic study. We  have partnerships with key organizations, such as Tony Bennett Foundation/Exploring the Arts, Martha Graham Dance  Company, EPIC Theatre Ensemble, and The Collegiate Chorale that support our teachers with improving instruction by  infusing the arts into their classrooms and providing students with exceptional art and career based learning  experiences. At UASPA, we believe that “education equals options,” meaning that students’ education and knowledge  will provide them with the skills necessary to pursue the post-secondary path of their choice, whether that be in the  arts or in another field. Our staff reflects these principles; for example, the principal is a dancer who pursued a career  in education, the guidance counselor is a vocalist who pursued a career in counseling and teachers who have  backgrounds in all areas of the arts who pursued a career in teaching.       UASPA ensures that students receive a rigorous education, are successful in earning a college degree and have a  vision for what their future holds. UASPA is partnered with College Bound Initiative and has a full time college  counselor. 100% of UASPA graduating seniors since the development of this partnership in the 2007 – 2008 school  year have been accepted to college and have earned an average of $700,000 in scholarships as a class each year.      In the 2016 - 2017 school year, UASPA earned 9 Proficient Ratings and 1 Developing Rating on the Quality Review. In  the 2017 - 2018 school year, UASPA was acknowledged through visits from the Superintendent and Deputy  Superintendent for shared instructional practices across classrooms that reflect the school's belief about how  students learn best. Practices include accountable talk, annotating, students referencing evidence from text to defend  their writing and discussions, opportunities for self-assessment and teachers making the assessment criteria known  both verbally and visually. Teachers are supported through frequent cycles of classroom observations and the trends  are used to plan targeted professional development. While UASPA has many instructional highlights, we continue to  provide teachers with cycles of professional development and opportunities for inter-visitations and common  planning focused on curricula development and formative assessment practices.             3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   UASPA continues to build our social-emotional program that focuses on using advisory to teach social emotional skills.  Over 80% of our student body receives free/reduced lunch and the average incoming ELA and Math proficiency scores  are 2.22 and 2.11 respectively. As a small school, we work to support our student achievement through various  supports. We strongly believe that the development of peer to peer relationships and teacher to student relationships  creates the context for students to feel more connected to school. Based on previous research, the implementation of  high quality SEL programs lead to a number of positive outcomes for students including: enhanced academic   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      achievement (as measured through credit accumulation), higher attendance, lower rates of behavioral concerns (as  measured by discipline referrals and suspension rates), stronger climate (as measured through the NYC school survey  and the NYC Panorama Survey) and ultimately higher graduation rates.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Progress: Supportive Environment & Collaborative Teachers. Within this area, our overall attendance increased from  80.8% to 82.9% and chronic absenteeism decreased 8.5% from 61.2% to 52.7%.   Key Area of Focus: Supportive Environment & Rigorous Instruction. Within this area, we will continue to work on our  attendance and Regents data.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 05M369   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   356   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.        Strengths :      Feedback from Quality Review, What UASPA does well:   1. Teacher teams consistently analyze assessment data for students they share through their grade team inquiry  work. “A grade nine teacher team was observed in a student work protocol meeting. Teachers individually read a  student writing sample and then shared their observations. After reading the writing sample, teachers discussed  which practices would support the student learning. (4.2- Proficient)   2. Distributed leadership structures allow teachers to have a voice in key decisions across the school. “A teacher  leader stated that their goal was to support teachers in improving in the Danielson Framework for teaching, including  domains under questioning, engagement and assessment. (4.2- Proficient)   3. Teachers create assessments and use rubrics that allow for, “actionable feedback to students during instruction and  make adjustment s to meet all students’ learning needs.” (2.2) Students also were able to use the rubrics for self  assessment, “A student self-evaluation rubric for earth science provided the teacher with areas of strength and areas  that the students feels need improvement.” (2.2) Finally, rubrics allowed teachers to make adjustments to their  instruction, “Teachers have stated that they make other adjustments in teacher practices.” (2.2- Proficient)   4. During professional development high expectations are consistently communicated, “To support the expectation of  providing rigorous instruction, the principal provided professional development on questioning discussion assessment  and Regents Data." In professional development, teachers were required to, “revise a lesson plan to include  circulating with a purpose, inclusive of sharing the assessment criteria, circulating and providing feedback based on  the assessment criteria and responding to data (3.4- Proficient)      Feedback from Principal Performance Review 2017-2018   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         1. The principal focused on misalignment between standards, learning targets and tasks. By the late fall, in addition  to unit planning, the professional development plan shifted its focus to lesson planning where tasks and learning  targets were aligned. Leadership observed a need for improvement in how teachers make in-the-moment  adjustments to address student misconceptions. Therefore, after Term 1, a focus on anticipating and responding to  student misconception was added to the scope of the work (2.2)   2. Administrators provide one-on-one coaching with lesson planning and trained teacher leaders to engage in  similar coaching. Teachers are making an effort to use rubrics to promote self-assessment and peer-assessment.  Feedback and planning is coming to life in the classrooms. Strong levels of student engagement was observed  consistently across classrooms (1.2, 2.2)      School Survey Highlights (2017 – 2018 school year):   1. Common Core Shifts in Literacy (100% positive response on survey)    2. Common Core Shifts in Math (100% positive response on survey)    3. 91% of students responded that, in most of all of their classes, it's clear what they need to do to get a good  grade.   4. 83% of students responded that in most of their classes, know what their teachers want them to learn in their  classes.

Some teachers  use exit tickets that are adjusted to meet the needs of individual students. Some lesson plans demonstrated ways  to engage a diversity of students into the curriculum.       Feedback from Principal Performance Review 2017 - 2018   Area of Focus:   1. Continue to develop teacher’s expertise in creating engaging student-centered discussions, communicating  success criteria and delivering quality feedback to improve student outcomes.    2. Continue to support ICT partners to ensure there is a strong rationale for their choice of models to meet the  needs of all learners.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Recruitment: UASPA has an active recruitment strategy encompassing many different activities for recruiting highly  qualified teachers. To start, a hiring committee is assembled consisting of the principal, assistant principal, teachers,  guidance personnel, and other staff members. Positions are posted on Open Market Hiring System, New Teacher  Finder, with the New York City Teaching Fellows, on our website (www.uaperformingarts.org) in addition to other  hiring sites. In addition, we have established partnerships with nearby colleges to recruit new graduates as well as  host student teachers during the year. Members of the hiring committee also attend NYC Hiring Fairs to meet  potential candidates and arrange interviews with other members of the hiring committee. We also have teachers who  work closely with the NYC Teaching Fellows during the summer in coaching roles who then help recruit teachers from  the summer program. As part of the interview process, the hiring team has created a hiring criteria that ensures that  all teachers are highly qualified prior to hiring.      Retention/Support/Assignments: Brand new teachers are provided a mentor and new teachers to the building are  paired with a "buddy" to help them acclimate to the operations and culture of UASPA. Our instructional leader  provides weekly feedback to new teachers to help them grow and the principal practices collaborative leadership  designed to empower staff members in the direction and growth of UASPA. For teachers, this can include  membership on the hiring committee, the instructional leadership team, or serving as a content or grade team leader.  Weekly professional development is tailored to allow teachers opportunities to visit our leader practitioners, so that  teachers can see instructional strategies in real time. Other professional development opportunities exist through  several networks including: NYC DOE Affinity Group, the Urban Assembly, partnership with New Visions, partnership  with EPIC Theatre Ensemble, and our partnership with CUNY. After student needs are assessed, teacher input on  assignments is requested by administration through a teacher preference sheet which is a factor used by  administration to assign teacher programs.           2b.

This  meeting consists of identifying instructional trends and/or needs of the entire staff and developing targeted  instructional strategies that are presented (via live or video model) at school wide professional development as well  as implemented in leaders' classes during the week. As part of this open classroom approach, teachers are invited to  attend the open classrooms and see the strategies implemented by teacher leaders in a real world environment. The  leadership team is comprised of at least one teacher from each discipline, thereby also allowing teachers to see  implementation in their own content area. All teachers are also members of a grade team and a content team; our  grade teams are tasked with tracking student progress across all disciplines and developing targeted strategies to help  students reach their potential in all classes. Our content teams work to take the instructional strategies developed  and presented by the instructional leadership team and implement them across the disciplines in that particular  content are - particularly focusing on developing rigorous and common core aligned curricula.      Professional development for school leaders consists of opportunities through the Affinity Group and the Urban  Assembly and includes: instructional rounds for principals and APs to visit other schools and view instructional  strategies at those schools, principal mentoring, and Advance support. The Urban Assembly also provides coaching for  instructional leaders, the principal, and the AP.        Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46        Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of  this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school.  Urban Assembly School for the Performing Arts, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act  (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student  achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in  planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Urban Assembly School for the Performing Arts will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Urban Assembly School for the Performing Arts, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of  student achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and  programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will  share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be  developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use our in-house and external literacy assessments For all of our incoming students we review their middle school data,  which includes 8th grade ELA scores. At the start of the year we administer a series of diagnostic tests: writing and reading  comprehension. All students take the DRP (Degrees of Reading Power) test in September, December, and May of each school  year to assess reading levels and growth. This data shows us where students are strong and where they need  improvement.  Additionally, our core content subjects as well as our ENL teacher administer a diagnostic at the beginning of  the year which are the followed by interim assessments in December and April.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We administer writing and reading diagnostic exams as a whole school - time is blocked off during the school day for all  students to take the exam simultaneously.  We also do the same for interim assessments throughout the year.  Once results   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         are received from data centers, PD time is allocated for teachers to review results and co-plan to address areas for  improvement in overall curricula and targeted supports for individual students.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Credit accumulation per academic year (10+ credits); Degrees of Reading Power scores; in-house Interim Assessment Data;  NYSESLAT scores; Regents Exam scores     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once results are received from data centers, PD time is allocated for teachers to review results and co-plan to address areas  for improvement in overall curricula and targeted supports for individual students.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Not applicable - we do not serve grades K-5.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We utilize NYSESLAT data along with Regents data in the four core subject areas - with particular attention to ELA, Algebra 1,  Global, US, and Living Environment.  We additionally study the credit accumulation of ELLs and whether they have met the 10  credit benchmark for the year.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ELL Data Analysis Tool is shared with our ENL teacher and with teachers of subject areas who have ELLs in their  classrooms.  We are additionally utilizing the DEXPRO tool to place all of a student's credit, Regents, and other testing data in  one easily accessible location.  Administrators of that system will be able to disseminate this information to classroom teachers  to provide real-time data on students and allow for adjustment at PD which includes both content and grade teams.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   We use a departmentalized, collaborative approach with some push in and some pull-out. Students at UASPA are in  heterogeneous classrooms. The Integrated Collaborative Teaching (ICT) model enables us to have at least two  teachers in these classrooms.  The push-in model enables us to provide additional support to ELL students within the  context of the classroom. Instructional materials are focused on providing explicit literacy support to appropriately  differentiate for ELL level and IEP needs.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Not applicable.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not applicable.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Students are programmed individually according to their proficiency level in English.  Students who are Entering receive 180  minutes of standalone ENL every week.  Emerging students receive 90 minutes of standalone ESL per week.  Our 9  th   and 10   th   grade ELLs receive ELA for ENL students 5 period a week.  Eleventh grade ELLs receive ELA for ENL students 5 periods a  week as well.  Long term ELLs receive push-in ESL services two periods per week.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   UASPA offers ENL instruction in English only.  Content area teachers are trained in teaching strategies that work for ELL  students such as: scaffolding, pre-teaching vocabulary and visuals and gestures.Content area teachers are expected to  differentiate their lessons with tiered activities that allow students of all ability levels to learn the same essential concepts in  different ways; and use adaptive technologies that modify the format of curriculum and/or assessment.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   We ensure that ELLS are appropriately evaluated in their native language by first identifying their native language through the  Home Language Survey which is administered during the initial interview process.  We use translated assessment materials to  evaluate our ELLs in their home language throughout the year.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    6 a & b. For newcomers, in addition to regular classroom instruction, we offer after school tutoring, Academic acceleration  courses  in Math and Saturday Academies at least once a month throughout the term. In addition, students are prepared for ELA  testing during their ESL class. Professional development support is provided to content area teachers of ELLs.   6 c. For developing ELLs, our goal is for them to not only attain proficiency, but to be prepared for the rigors  of college coursework. Afterschool homework help and tutoring is available to all ELL students, as well as Saturday Academy  courses for test prep. Regents prep is also available for students.  6 d. For Long-Term ELLs, we offer tutoring and a Saturday Academy where we focus on intensive  NYSESLAT preparation and ELA Regents preparation. Teachers and guidance counselors maintain communication with the  parents to discuss the program and student progress.  6 e. Former ELLs in years 1 & 2 after testing proficient are extended the same tutoring offerings, as well as entrance into  Saturday Academy, as current ELLs. Additionally, student performance on the NYC Performance Assessment, as well as the  Regents and/or CCLS Math/ELA exam is monitored for all former ELLs in year 1 or 2 after testing proficient to ensure they are  continuing to thrive in a mainstream environment. Parent communication and enrollment in after school tutoring, homework  help or test prep is recommended at the conclusion of each marking period for those students not showing adequate progress  on periodic assessments.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELLs who are identified as having special needs are provided with any and all accommodations as per their Individualized  Education Plan (paraprofessionals, testing accommodations etc.) Push-in ESL services are recommended, if possible, to reduce  the  time out of the general education classroom dependent on the Related Services, Special Education classes indicated on the IEP.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  See #8.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Content area teachers provide meaningful lessons that strengthen background information and promote the  literacy of students. As previously described above, we also offer a Saturday School Academy to students for the purposes of  test preparation for NYSESLAT, ELA Regents and MS ELA Exams.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We will review the data from our accelerated courses, literacy classes, as well as Regents data and scores on the NYSESLAT to  determine where refinements and improvements need to be made in instruction.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs both academic and extracurricular. In addition, they participate in after  school clubs and artistic showcases.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The instructional materials used in the ESL program support the development of language acquisition across the content areas.  Teachers incorporate a variety of source material from NYS approved resources. Supplementary textbooks and the use of  dictionaries, glossaries and content area books are also provided as well as the opportunity to utilize technology via laptop or  iPad carts.               13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is provided in the ESL classroom. This is done by clarifying directions in students' L1 when possible.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The ESL curriculum is differentiated to support students' needs by age and grade level. The textbooks utilized are age  appropriate and reflect lexile level.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The instructional materials used in the ESL program support the development of language acquisition across the content areas.  Teachers incorporate a variety of source material from NYS approved resources. Supplementary textbooks and the use of  dictionaries, glossaries and content area books are also provided as well as the opportunity to utilize technology via laptop or  iPad carts.               16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   All newly enrolled students are afforded the opportunity to attend a Summer Bridge program where, over the course of three  days, they are introduced to teachers & staff, develop an understanding of UASPA's culture and expectations, and develop a  sense of the artistry that is a part of our school.  Incoming freshman receive home visits where administrators, teachers, and  staff members develop a relationship with students and parents prior to the first day of school in September.  This provides an  opportunity for direct conversation about hopes and wishes and staff members can then alert teachers to any potential issues   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         that may arise.  Materials are translated into the home language in order ensure clarity in expectations.  Teachers are notified  of ELL students at the beginning of the year so that appropriate instructional modifications/decisions can be made.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Our school offer Spanish as an elective.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  ELL teachers participate in whole school PD as well as being members of content and grade teams.  Additionally, ELL teachers  are encouraged to participate in both Affinity and New Visions PDs related to ELL policy and pedagogy.  Recently, we agreed to  participate in a cohort with the Global Language Program which offers support to world language teachers but has also opened  to share resources and contacts with our ELL teacher.                 2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.               Teachers participate in weekly grade team meetings that focus on the Danielson Framework for teaching. We specifically  examine how we understand the needs of our students. Teachers actively think about knowing all of their students and  engaging them in the curriculum. Departments also meet once weekly and participate in curriculum and professional  development geared at strengthening access to Common Core-aligned curriculum as well as infusing literacy throughout all  content areas.  This amounts to two hours per month. Grade teams also look at planning instruction for all students and  specifically look at the Danielson framework. Grade team meetings amount to five hours per month. All teachers have  common planning time. Our grade teams consistently analyze data from in-class work, scholarship reports, and assessments to  help tailor their instruction to meet the needs of their students.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   After the initial back to school night and first parent teacher conference, meetings with ELL parents are specifically planned to  evaluate student progress to date.  Depending on the home language, staff members can assist with translation or the DOE  translation services are utilized.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60            2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  All parents are invited to grade specific as well as school-wide events. All parents are encouraged to participate in monthly PA  meetings. All students have an advisor who acts as the primary liaison between school and home. Throughout the year we  actively invite parents into the school building for open school nights, individual parent meetings, special community events,  such as Senior Convocation, Community Welcomes, Potluck Dinners, Alumni Day, and our Winter and Spring Showcases. We  use one of our many on-site staff to offer translation services for families.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Meghan McMahon, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The home language survey is used to identify family needs in translation and interpretation. Parent conferences,  interviews and outreach confirm the needs of families. Written translation is provided through our in school  program of Skedula or through the translation unit and pedagogues who speak the language provide oral  translations when necessary. These findings are shared with the staff during grade team meetings, especially prior  to parent conferences.         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    403   125   1   4   1   1   English   Spanish   Haitian Creole   French   Fulani   Mandinka (aka  Mandingo)           75.33   23.36   0.19   0.75   0.19   0.19   404   124   1   4   1   1   75.51   23.18   0.19   0.75   0.19   0.19   3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu).

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      We utilize two systems that provide translation services in messaging: Skedula Messenger (provides text translation in  parents' preferred language) and School Messenger (translates phone messages into Spanish). For parents whose  preferred language is not English or Spanish, phone calls will be handled through the phone interpretation services.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Staff members are informed on the goals of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 through all staff training at the start of  each year. The instructions for accessing the interpretation service are in the handbook as well as disseminated  through email prior to events where face to face interaction is likely. Staff are instructed in the use of Google translate  as well as which staff members are proficient in translating particular languages. Funding is set aside each year to  provide translation or interpretation services when DOE or free resources are not available or cannot meet the  demand.             Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66           Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)   We will identify the spoken language of families in our Master Phone Log database and use it as a reference for  providing written and oral translation. Staff will ensure that an in-house staff member is available to provide  translation. If not, the staff member will access the automated translation service through the DOE.   Languages spoken are posted in the entrance to the school.   Parents will receive letters notifying them of the translation and interpretation services and options at UASPA: in- person translation and automated.         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We will gather feedback primarily through the use of parent surveys.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67
