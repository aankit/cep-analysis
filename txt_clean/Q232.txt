This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   MISSION STATEMENT OF P.S. 232 – The mission of the P.S. 232 family is to provide an academically challenging and  integrated curriculum within a safe and nurturing school environment, our “home away from home”. We, a team of  educators, students, and parents, will continue to utilize all available resources to prepare all students to meet high  quality and challenging standards of excellence. PS 232 is a diverse school with high academic and social expectations  for all students. We serve the needs of all students - students who speak another language, students with learning  disabilities, and students who are intellectually gifted! That’s what makes our school work! It is culturally and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      academically diverse and all school members respect one another. We provide a safe and nurturing school  environment where everyone knows everyone in our ‘home away from home’!       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    We are a PreK-8 school, and we are proud of the fact that we provide a curriculum that educates the whole child –  academically, socially, and creatively. We have a history of instructional excellence and high expectations that  includes a middle school extra curricula program of both sports and the creative arts. We are presently educating 972  students in a PreK-8 building, and we are proud of the fact that we are “PS 232”, not “PS/MS 232”! We are not two  separate schools; we have our own distinct culture of a PreK-8, all one family under one roof! Our program of  curricular subjects is aligned to Common Core and establishes a strong foundation of Core Knowledge through  challenging and stimulating activities to enhance student engagement and learning. Our standards-based science  program is designed to use inquiry and discovery in an interdisciplinary curriculum, dedicating a hands-on science  teacher to grades in grades PreK-8. Technology is used throughout as a tool for building and analyzing a deep content  base and applying it in innovative ways. We value our partnerships with Midori & Friends Inc., Studio in a School, and  ArtsPower. We have met Adequate Yearly Progress (AY)) in all measured areas and earned special recognition for our  students in eighth grade who 100% passed the 2017-18 Regents in Earth Science and Integrated Algebra I and 80%  passed the 2017-18 Language Proficiency Exam in Spanish.   We welcomed our first 3K and PreK class in September, 2018. Early school experience for our incoming three and four  year olds will provide a positive and enriching experience and will prepare them for a successful kindergarten.   Our teachers are offered and attend professional learning opportunities pertaining to best practices embedded in  standards-based instruction. Our teacher teams continue to plan and integrate Core Knowledge themes into the K-8  curriculum, in addition to using the New York State Common Core Standards and NYC Scope and Sequence. For  example, our 5 year olds are learning how to read and write as they are introduced to content area literature about  their community, the Pilgrims, American symbols, and the continents of the world. Our philosophy is that their  knowledge base will be broader and then in the future, their prior knowledge and writing experiences will be richer.   We provide a comprehensive computer program that enables our students in grades 5 – 8 to develop extensive  computer skills beyond word-processing as they do their research. Our technology specialist collaborates with  teachers so that the technology experience can integrate the knowledge base of the classroom. She also conducts  workshops throughout the year for our teachers, and collaborates and integrates her program with each teacher’s  instructional goals and objectives. She also conducts two parent workshops in collaboration with our parent  coordinator throughout the year. Our goal is to continue to place class sets of laptops into every fifth, sixth, seventh,  and eighth grade classrooms. In addition, we plan to install a Promethean Board in every classroom. This plan includes  professional learning opportunities for all staff members to learn how to use the technology through TEQ. We also  maintain a maintenance plan with TEQ to be able to repair our technology throughout the year.   An emphasis on intensive and ongoing professional learning opportunities in many areas has effectively improved our  literacy and math program, and as a result, has helped to transform our staff into effective and highly effective  teachers. The principal and two assistant principals, two literacy coaches, and other lead teachers provide extensive  professional learning opportunities with an emphasis on guided reading, writing, social emotional learning, and  mathematics with an intensive support for new staff members. Inter-class visitations are scheduled so that our  teachers may improve their pedagogy by observing their highly effective colleagues. .Last year, we received a Phase lll  grant from Teachers College for Writing that helped transform writing instruction in our school. This year, we will  continue our relationship with Columbia University - Teachers' College Writing Program that will provide our teachers  will two teacher trainers who will spend time in our classrooms, providing on-site professional learning to our K-5  teachers. We continue to invest time in training our teachers in grades 4-8 with Junior Great Books. Junior Great  Books is a supplemental reading program that focuses on teacher questioning and improving higher order reading   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      skills and writing. Ongoing supports are provided to our teachers so that each teacher ensures that our reading  program in the upper grades will help us maintain and improve the comprehension of our students.    Our emphasis in mathematics has been on making math language connections, creating math workshop model  classrooms, focusing on math language, and transforming math assessments and lesson development in the “Go  Math” curriculum in grades six through eight. The 2018-19 year will include Phase I Algebra for All training for our  grade 5-8 math teachers. Our fifth grade teachers will have the support of a second math teacher in the room four  times per week so that it creates a smaller teacher-student ratio for important math lessons.    To support the goals of our Professional Learning Opportunities Program in K-8, future topics will include the  following:    Units of Study in Go Math in Middle School  Item skills Analysis of NYS exams (to inform teacher practice and students’ strength and challenges)   Special Education: Writing IEPs that Align with Goals and State Standards     Danielson: Assessment and Student Engagement ( this year’s instructional focus)    Algebra for All in grades 5-8    Units of Study in Pearson Mathematics in K-5          Teacher Team Planning: Designing and Upgrading Curriculum Maps     English Language Learners: Classroom Strategies to Help ENL Students Succeed        Writers' Workshop - Teachers' College Professional Development in K-5    Special Education - Writing IEPs that Make Sense  Formative Assessment    Two of our most enjoyable accomplishments are the Middle School Club Program for grades 6, 7 and 8 and the Casa  Grant supported Midori School Chorus. As a result of last year’s data from the Learning Environment Survey, both  parents and students expressed their concern with the lack of creative arts and extra-curricula activities in our school.  Each year we revamp our program and provide an after-school club program that is more diversified and controlled  by budget. This year we are hoping to have our afterschool chorus for year two, funding pending. Our third, fourth  and fifth graders attend a 3 hour program that emphasizes remediation in reading/writing and mathematics during  the school week. Our plan is to create small class size so that we can have more of an instructional impact.    One challenge at PS 232Q is the reduction of school funds due to register loss. We are exploring grant opportunities  to secure funding for the technology in our building. We also need an electrical upgrade for our school in order to  support our classrooms with air conditioners and technology. Another major challenge is the lack of air conditioning in  our school building.   We have a strong Parent Teacher Association that consists of a small group of approximately 15 devoted parents that  plan and organize many of our school events for both students and staff. The PTA is led by our co-presidents who  work very closely with our administration. A concerted on-going effort has been made to increase parental  involvement. Both our Co-Presidents and our school’s Parent Coordinator continue to reach out to families by  providing monthly PTA meetings and workshops. We are very proud that we had 99% parent survey participation this  year. The administration continues to communicate to families through our school website (www.ps232q.org),  monthly calendars, the Principal’s monthly newsletter, the monthly Principal's Breakfasts/Workshops, and our  "REMIND" app for parents, and parent engagement events that take place every other month. We collaborate with  our parent association and schedule events that will bring increase parental involvement (events like High School  Application Night, Literacy Night, Halloween Costume Party, Talent Show, Pep Rally, Spirit Week Activities, Graduation  Barbecue, and School Carnival, etc.).      3.

We continue to analyze our  yearly data for each Student with Disabilities and individualize an educational plan for each one. We continue to  target their weaknesses and strengths: decoding, encoding, comprehension, etc. We also mainstream many of our  Students with Disabilities in ELA, math, science, and/or social studies. We analyze hard and soft data daily, weekly,  and monthly, and as a result, make recommendations for improvement. We also have a strong RTI program in place  to support our struggling readers. The RTI program we use is the Fountas & Pinnell Reading Intervention Program.  Four out-of-classroom reading specialists and our SETTS teacher have been trained to use this program. Students are  targeted in kindergarten through eighth grades; remediation takes place in small groups of four students.      4.

Activity #1 – Teacher Teams Developing a Rigorous Literacy Plan         Teacher Teams   Our school's faculty will design a K-8 literacy program that will  consist of three components: professional development, inquiry  team work, and the use of data-driven instruction. All activities  will be designed to increase the use of data to drive instruction  and to enable teachers to examine effectiveness of instruction  regularly. Teacher to student ratio will be decreased by the hiring  of RTI and F-status teachers who all specialize in reading/literacy.  Professional development will include the revisiting of our  curriculum maps to include more CCLS –based activities, creating  new curriculum maps, to increase the effective use of Essential  Questions, the use of data to drive instruction, and increase the  effectiveness of the collaborative inquiry process. Professional  development provided by the administrators, literacy coaches,  teacher leaders, and district professional developers will include  close reading. Teachers of K-8 will continue last year’s work on  their teacher teams to develop collaborative curriculum maps  that focus on social studies and science units of study that  incorporate reading, writing, speaking and listening skills. Four  Square Writing organizational methodologies will be fully  implemented and integrated within Writer’s Workshop to  support student growth in writing skills. Teacher-created writing  rubrics and instructional tasks will be created by our teacher  teams. Resulting student work will then be analyzed by grade  level teacher teams and decisions will be made on next steps for  instruction in each classroom. Teacher teams will meet weekly  during their inquiry period to analyze student work, benchmark  and progress monitoring data to identify strengths and  weaknesses, and modify instruction as needed.

The intervention is different for every child, assessing what the  child knows and what s/he needs to learn next. The focus of each  lesson is to understand messages in reading and construct  messages in writing; learning how to attend to detail without  losing focus on meaning. A combination of teacher judgment and  systematic evaluation procedures that identify those lowest- achieving children. The intervention goal is to improve their  reading levels and give them the assistance they need to develop  independent reading and writing strategies. Once they are  reading and writing at a level of a 2.5 or higher, their series of  lessons will be discontinued and a new group of students will  begin reading intervention.   The intervention is not an alternative to good classroom teaching,  but is complementary, to enable children to engage in their  classroom program. The lowest performing children (the bottom  5-20% depending on the context) were identified using the  Fountas & Pinnell Benchmarking System Assessment.

In 2017-18, PS 232 developed student-led Social Emotional Learning (SEL) literature-based lessons for all students in  kindergarten through 4th grade. The goal of these lessons, taught by heterogeneously grouped 5th and 6th grade  students, was to increase each student’s emotional vocabulary and self-awareness.    According to the New York City School Survey: 61% of students stated that they rarely or never harass, bully, or  intimidate other students at their school. 76% of students say that students rarely or never harass, bully, or intimidate  each other because of other differences, like disability or weight, at their school.   In the Framework Element of Supportive Environment, PS 232’s rating has decreased from 4.47 in 2016 to 4.02 in  2018.   Based on the data above, the SLT has concluded that PS 232’s priority need in Supportive Environment is to create a  SEL program for students in grades 5-8 that focuses on character development.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 232Q, the Lindenwood School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title  I, Part A of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. 232Q will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.               School-Parent Compact (SPC)   P.S.232 Lindenwood School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB)  Act, is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families.

All ELLs in  every grade level are grouped heterogeneously amongst all students in general education.   We have two state certified ENL teachers that service 49 English Language Learners. Every  ENL gets the state mandated number of ENL instructional minutes per week. At PS 232, all  ENLs receive ELA, math, social studies, and science instruction from the regular classroom and  cluster teachers in addition to the state mandated number of ENL instructional minutes on a daily  basis. Content subjects like social studies and science are taken in read-aloud and shared reading  activities daily.  Our program for SIFE have the following components: literacy and content courses that are  thematically coordinated and encourage transfer of learning across content areas, small classes  that allow individual attention from the teachers, and course structure that allows students to  learn at their own pace. Other strategies that we use are as follows:  1. Direct Instruction - ENL teacher introduces academic content to the SIFE student population  by using visuals such as charts, graphs, Venn diagrams, and time lines. Collaborative learning  activities such as task oriented projects and small-group activities instead of traditional note  taking, demonstrations instead of lectures.  2. CCLS-based Learning - Teacher creates lessons that are CCLS standards-based yet suitable  and differentiated for students' various ability levels. PS 232 ensures that content and materials  are age appropriate and culturally appropriate.  The ENL teacher, regular classroom teachers, and other service providers meet regularly, usually  biweekly, to discuss each SIFE student's progress in all subject areas, clarifying both strengths  and areas needing extra work.  ENL students with less than three years of ENL instruction are given intensive, structured and  systematic intervention that includes phonics, phonological awareness, and word identification.  Differentiated instructions are executed - teachers must have a repertoire of strategies so that  they can vary their interaction and curriculum as needed. Hopefully, most of the ENL students  exit the program within the first three years or earlier. For ENLs receiving 4-6 years of ENL  service, the school plans to give them instruction in comprehensive reform programs using  systematic phonics, one-to-one or small group tutoring program, cooperative learning program,  inclusion in RTI (response to intervention) use of Fountas & Pinnell Intervention System  Program, and/or programs emphasizing extensive reading and writing. We currently do not have  any long term ENLs.  ENLs with disabilities are given interventions with explicit phonetic awareness instruction,  structured and systematic phonics instruction, explicit instruction in comprehension strategies,  and peer-assessed learning activities. In addition, sheltered English techniques such as the use of  visual aids like props, pictures, gestures, and facial expressions help convey meaning and  encourage children to expand and elaborate their responses to help develop oral expression  abilities. Speech and language therapy is a related service that is delivered to IEP mandated   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   students. These students have expressive, receptive, pragmatic, fluency, motor and/or  phonological difficulties that affect their academic performance.Therapy is given a minimum of  two times per week in 30 minute sessions.  PS 232 continues to analyze its yearly data for each "Special Needs" child and individualize an  educational plan for each one. Students are streamed by reading level. We continue to target their  weaknesses and strengths: decoding, encoding, comprehension, etc. Many of our special needs  students are mainstreamed in both ELA and/or math. Testing accommodations are provided for  all tests: classroom, city, and state according to the IEP mandate. These accommodations are as  follows: time limit extended or waived, exam administered in special location, questions read  aloud to students, answers recorded in any manner, exam in Braille or large print, directions read  and re-read aloud, visual magnification and auditory amplification, and masks/markers to  maintain place.  To maintain effective ENL strategies and techniques, PS 232 has purchased high interest, high  quality books every year. Some of these are Time for Kids Readers, Eye on History Thematic  Units, Guided Reading Leveled Books in fiction and non-fiction, Junior Great Books -  Roundtable, Strategies that Work by Harvey & Goudvis, Document Readers, Smart Boards, and  Projectors, Fountas & Pinnell Intervention Kits, Fountas & Pinnell Assessment Kits, etc.  Computer lessons and projects focus on both technology skills and major themes in the academic  content areas. Lower grade students focus on comparing MAC and PC platforms, Microsoft  Word, Excel and Power Point, as well as Internet applications. Upper grade students use these  technology skills on a more advanced level. They also use multimedia applications such as  photography, video editing and animation. All computer lessons are created to incorporate  Common Core Standards in addition to the Core Knowledge Framework that we use at PS 232.  The instructional strategies and techniques being employed by the state certified ENL teacher  supplements any instructional approach used by the classroom teachers. Team teaching and  push-in strategies are being implemented on some grade levels. Weekly consultations with the  classroom teachers are scheduled. Instruction is based on activating prior knowledge and  recognizing the strong correlations between literacy in the first and second languages. English  Language Learners participate in read-alouds, interdependent dialogues, partner and echo  reading, shadow and whisper reading, silent reading, shared reading, independent reading, and a  wide variety of writing activities on a daily basis.  In addition, ENL students receive content- based instruction that will enable them to meet standards in math, science, social studies, and  computer technology.  In addition to instructional practices there are support services provided to our ELL students as  follows:   1. The Fountas and Pinnell RTI System is a program that is used with all students who struggle  with reading and writing. It provides a teacher-friendly, comprehensive program that  incorporates the principles of teaching reading and writing. Its essential components are  phonemic awareness, decoding alphabetic principle (sound/symbol relationship), encoding  (spelling), advanced word analysis, vocabulary development, right word instruction,  metacognition, fluency and comprehension strategies.  2. Speech and language therapy is a related service that is delivered to IEP mandated students.  These students have expressive receptive, pragmatic, fluency, motor and/or phonological  difficulties  that affect their academic performance. Therapy is given a minimum of two times  per week in 30 minutes sessions.   Our ENL after school program is also funded by Title III and it is  taught by a certified ENL  teacher twice a week. Our program is designed to help improve reading, writing, listening, and  speaking skills and strategies in both language and content. It  will consist of one group of K-4  ENL students  and another group of grade 5-8 students  who will spend an additional 120  minutes in school from 2:30 - 4:30 p.m. Some ENL participants are IEP mandated students also.  Scholastic materials will be purchased to help them during both guided reading sessions and read   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   alouds in fiction and non-fiction.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?   The teachers use Fountas and Pinnell benchmarking assessment and teacher created assessments for initial and periodic  assessments.  The outcomes from these assessments will determine the literacy skills and reading levels (Fountas and Pinnell)  for each student.  The teacher will also use this data to drive instruction in the classrooms. Teachers will meet to disseminate  data and plan future instruction. The data indicates that ENLs who are proficient do better at grasping the material and seem  to progress quicker. The data helps teachers plan for RTI tiers of learning and instruction. The data will also help teachers  create small group instruction which lends itself to guided practice during guided reading and leveling of classroom libraries.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Benchmarking takes place in Sept., January, and May of 2017-18 school year.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our ENLs by the ELA results and NYSESLAT, examining the percentage of students testing  proficient/commanding each year, moving up levels is a strong indication of program success.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    There are three reading/language intervention teachers in place. There is one ENL teacher who serves our ENL students. ENL  students will receive both ENL services and RTI services.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    Teachers utilize RTI within the classroom with small group instruction; focusing on individual needs of students. Teachers are  constantly assessing students and using the results to plan future lessons and groups. Our school uses four assessment types  for Tier 1 RTI, formative, screening, outcome, and test prep; they are aligned with day to day instruction. Data is collected and  analyzed to plan further instruction. We have data driven Tier 1 instruction in our classrooms. Screening assessments  determine our need for intervention of Tier 2 and Tier 3. We have implemented Reading Recovery as a Tier 3 intervention plan  within our school for 1  st   graders. Students are provided with increasingly intensive, targeted instruction designed to match  their learning needs, as demonstrated by performance on periodically administered assessments.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   A review of the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data indicates that in grades K through 8, students scored lowest in the writing sub- test. Therefore, the implementation of Writers Workshop and the Writing Process during Junior Great Books both play a huge  part in developing our ENLs writing and overall skills. the focus for these learners is the integration of reading and writing into  activities which call upon the listening and speaking skills. We see that many of our students moved up a level or more on the  NYSESLAT. Most of our students are at the expanding level. The large increase in students scoring at the expanding level reflect  the targeted instruction received previously. A focus on vocabulary and reading comprehension through Balanced Literacy is  being used to continue growth.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Teacher teams meet periodically with the ENL teacher in order to discuss findings and recreate fluid students groups of  instruction and intervention.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The freestanding ENL program is designed to support ENLs in second language development. ENL is provided as a pull- out program for students in grades K-8 where students are grouped by grade and level of proficiency.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     not applicable     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      not applicable         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              The ENL teacher reviews all data from the NYSITELL, LAB-R and NYSESLAT Exams in order to identify each student's  proficiency level to ensure that mandated instructional minutes are provided. As per CR-Part 154-2, entering ELLs receive 360  minutes of ELL instruction per week; 180 minutes of stand alone and 180 minutes of integrated. Emerging ELLs receive 360  minutes of ELL instruction; 90 minutes of stand alone and 180 minutes of integrated with 90 minutes of flexibility in either  stand alone or intergrated.  Transitioning students receive 180 minutes of ELL instruction; 90 minutes of integrated with 90  minutes of flexibility in either stand alone or integrated. Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL.  Commanding  ELLs receive 90 minutes of ELL instruction with flexibility in stand alone or integrated.             3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.       Content area instruction is delivered in English using ELA methodology and instructional strategies.  ESL teachers push-in to  content area classes to assist all level ELLs. Instruction is aligned with ESL and ELA standards.  To assist in making content more  comprehensible, ELL students are provided with bilingual dictionaries and/or glossaries.  ELL students are also paired with  other students who speak the same native language and have a strong command of English.  These students act as "buddies"  and work collaboratively with their partners to improve content area understanding.  Currently, benchmark, formative and  summative assessments are used to gauge acquisition of the English language.  The ESL teachers work in collaboration with the  General Education teachers to differentiate the material and scaffold instruction to ensure that it is age and content  appropriate.          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      All ENLs are ensured proper and appropriate evaluations in their native language. Whenever necessary, students are  provided assessment in their native language. All NYS tests are provided in the student's native language.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Differentiation of Instruction for all ELL subgroups includes: embedding definitions and language in content areas, using real  world artifacts and visual aids to support comprehension, drawing on student background to activate prior knowledge, and the  use of tiered questioning to support the development of higher order thinking in English.  a. SIFE students: Content area and ENL teachers meet and conference about the individual achievement levels and needs of  the students.  Students who appear to be falling far behind are referred to the School Based Support Team for evaluation.  b. Newcomers (0-3 years): Teachers use cooperative learning techniques in the content areas to provide students to ELL  students.  Students are regularly assessed to determine their progress.  ENL teachers work closely with content area teachers  to scaffold instruction.  ENL teachers also schedule planning time to meet the needs of their students when they push-in to  content area classes.    c. ELL students receiving 4-6 years of service: Use of adapted literature to insure authentic and high quality reading.   Use of  leveled and non-fiction libraries to provide high interest material at students' present reading level.  Content area teachers  conference with ENL teachers to scaffold subject area material.  All material is differentiated but rigorous to insure students  meet current state standards in all core subjects.    d. Long-term ENLs: Use of adapted literature to insure authentic and high quality reading.  Use of leveled and non-fiction  libraries to provide high interest material at students' present reading level.  Content area teachers conference with ENL  teachers to scaffold subject area material.  All material is differentiated but rigorous to insure students meet current state   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68      standards in all core subjects.  Individual needs are assessed by teachers.  Teachers use data inquire to monitor progress and  refer students to the School Based Support Team if needed.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   We use the Balanced Literacy Program in grades K- 8 and supplement with Junior Great Books in grades 4-8.  The curriculum  provides extra ELL support kits and instruction that promote language development.  All teachers have access to SESIS. They  review students IEPs and arrange schedules and programs accordingly to meet all mandates on IEP. Whenever necessary,  student is provided with a bilingual instructor and/or paraprofessional.       The certified ENL teachers for grades K-8, utilizes a  variety of instructional techniques, strategies, and ENL methodologies to enhance the academic performance of English  Language Learners.  The instructional techniques employed during instruction include modeling, scaffolding, bridging,  contextualization, schema building, text representation, and meta-cognitive development.  Through a thematic approach to  teaching students are taught the four modalities of language: reading, writing, speaking, and listening; using the  aforementioned instructional techniques.  During the thematic approach to instruction the five ENL approaches are  employed.  They include Cooperative Learning, The Natural Approach, The Language Experience Approach, Total Physical  Response, and the Whole Language Approach.  For students at the beginning language level, instruction focuses on Basic  Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS).  As students reach the intermediate and advanced levels of language the focus  shifts towards Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP).      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Small group instruction for long-term ENLs addresses  the deficient skills as determined by the NYSESLAT Exam. The Title III  after-school program that focuses on literacy skills. All students with disabilities are mainstreamed as much as possible; to  include; but not limited to, gym, lunch, mainstreaming and re-evaluating IEPs where necessary to provide a least restrictive  environment.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Long term and Advanced ELL students are being targeted for writing intervention as well as an intensive look at  Reading/Writing throughout the content areas; which is where our students seem to struggle the most.  The students are also  provided glossaries/dictionaries and native language novels that support language acquisition.  SWDs who are also an ELL  student receive all mandates described in their IEP.          9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the upcoming school year, we are training staff on the use of a computer based program, Imagine Learning. A greater  emphasis has also been placed on differentiated tiered instruction in all classes which enables us to meet the academic needs  of our ENLs. We also want to improve our attempts with RTI to ensure success for all of our students and maintain meeting the  AYP every year.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ENL students are invited to attend after-school and Saturday morning programs housed at  PS 232 in addition to ENL  services.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   The instructional materials used to support ELL students include: SMART boards, lap tops, individualized computer program,  Imagine Learning.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In ENL native language support is provided through computer programs, picture dictionaries, thesaurus use, boos in student's  native language, and translation websites. Our own school website translates all announcements into any language.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   Service support corresponds to ELL student ages and grade levels.  Students are provided independent readers at their  readability level and are scaffolded through teacher and student support to engage with all material that is appropriate for  both content and age level.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     The instructional materials used to support ELL students include: SMART boards, lap tops, individulaized computer program,  Imagine Learning.        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Each June, newly enrolled students are welcomed.  The students meet various staff members and are introduced to the school  environment during walk-through tours.  This helps acclimate the students so they are more comfortable when school  begins.  Students are also when possible, "buddied" with a same language partner to aid in the transition.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    not applicable      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   not applicable         Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  This year the staff will be provided with intensive professional development with a focus on Differentiated Instruction, Writing,  and Effective Strategies for English Language Learners such as, schema building, contextualization and modeling.        All teachers including ENL teachers have and will continue to have ongoing training in Common Core.  ENL teacher attend  department meetings to ensure that they too are aligning their lessons to the Core.  Additionally during department meeting  and common planning content area teachers meet and plan with the ENL teachers.  The ENL teachers support and share best  practices with them so that they can differentiate and plan accordingly to meet the needs of ENL students while aligning to the  Common Core.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70         how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  PS 232 is a K-8 school, therefore as our elementary students' transition to middle school, staff of ENLs receive an eligibility list  with NYSESLAT scores as well as full access to STARS which provides indicators and data on ENLs. All data on students are  compiled and reviewed by teachers. Our ENL teacher is available to provide professional development s needed which can  include compliance and instructional issues, preparation for the NYSESLAT and program design. Middle school students are  provided with a list of ELL High Schools, open house opportunities and summer school preparation courses for ENLs.   Our school provides professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically address the needs of English  Language Learners. A minimum of 15% of the required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed by CR Part  80 must be dedicated to language acquisition including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating  language and content instruction for English Language Learners .       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parent and community involvement is paramount to the success of ENL students.  Classroom teachers are encouraged to work  collaboratively with parents to ensure that they best meet the needs of ELL students.  The ENL teacher holds meetings for  parents to educate them on the programs available to ELL students including their parent choice options to place the children  either in a bilingual or dual language program and state assessments and standards. All teachers are contracted to meet with  parents individually. Tuesday afternoons are alloted a 40 minute time frame to conference with parents regarding their  children. We have staff available for translation service in the parent/guardians preferred language. If necessary we contact  the Office of Translation and Interpretation Unit for provisions. .   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   We meet individually with the parents or guardians of English language learners at least once a year, in addition to parent- teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled meetings provided for parents  or guardians, to discuss the goals of the program, their child's language development progress, their child's English language  proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. This additional meeting should include  school staff necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the child's language development in all content  areas in English and in the child's home language in the case of students enrolled in a bilingual education program. Such  meeting is conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication the parent or guardian  best understands. Parent engagement is mandated and time is provided to annually meet with ELL parents.  The ENL teacher  has a compliance binder and data binder to retain all records of her outreach to parents weather face to face, email, letters, or  by phone conference. We keep parent engagement appointments sheets, parent sign in sheets, and parent communication  logs on record. During any or all of these meetings we discuss the goals of the program, their child’s language development  progress, their child’s English language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content  areas.  Meetings are conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator, through the Translation and Interpretation Unit, if  needed. We also currently have 5 personnel available on staff for translation and interpretation.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lisa A. Josephson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   232                                                                              School DBN: 27Q232  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Our Pupil Personnel Secretary, Marie Gianola, asks the parents/guardians of the new student(s) in which language  they would like to receive verbal and written communications from the school. We also refer to the Home  Language Survey on which it states in Part III in which language the parents/guardians prefer to receive written  and verbal communication. It is also entered into ATS for informational purposes. We also ask parents and  guardians to answer that question on our school's yellow emergency sheets so that when any adult is contacting  the home, they know which language is needed for communication. Our school's website containing all pertinent  information translates into all the languages used by the families of our students. Additionally, school notices and  documents are translated into appropriate languages and academic reports such as progress reports and  academic/behavior monitoring sheets are also translated. During our PTA meetings and Open School activities,  translators are made available.Our E-Chalk personal school website also has the capabilities of translating school  information and the calendar into many languages.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75     2.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Each year we distribute the NYC Learning Environment Survey and review its data for feedback on our quality of  service to our parents with translation needs. Our Parent Coordinator ensures that all parents receive the services  they need and request if they are satisfied or if additional assistance is needed. Our E.N.L. teacher, Ms. Moore, asks  each parent/guardian of our ELLs if they received and understood the information provided to them in their preferred  language. Administrators verify with parents if they received the translation services they needed during conferences  and meetings.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78
