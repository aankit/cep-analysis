This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   P.S.48’s Mission Statement is to develop a partnership with parents which results in a program with educates  students to think critically, communicate effectively, meet challenging high standards of excellence, possess positive  self-esteem, and contribute to their school, their community and the world in which they live.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      We are a school with a long and proud tradition of success and achievement. Staff, students and the parents all  believe in the school and value it for the way in which it supports, motivates and develops them. High endeavor, high  standards and a spirit of team work and cooperation are the hallmarks of the Mapleton School.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Public School 48 in located in the middle-income area of the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn New York. This Title I  Pre-Kindergarten to fifth grade school serves a population of approximately 601 students from culturally diverse  backgrounds. This community where 22 languages are spoken is home to many new immigrants from Eastern Europe,  Central America and Asia. The school is a central part of the community to many of the students and families.    The Mapleton School serves as a model for bridging the community and school. Some of our partnerships include:  Federation of Italian American Organization, New York Methodist Hospital, Health Plus, Ballet Tech, and Dancing  Classrooms. All members of the school community feel part of the historical school family, several generations  because of the respect and care they are shown. The administration and the staff encourage and support parents as  partners in their children’s education. There is a high degree of communication and shared information about how to  help your child at home. As one parent stated, “This school is all about kids”.   P.S.48 uses Teachers College Reading and Writing Project for the teaching of reading. The key components of our  literacy program include; Reading Workshop (Mini-Lesson, Independent/Partner Reading), Read Alouds, Guided  Reading, Shared Reading and Word Study.

Students participate in Art, Music, Band, Chorus, Library  and Physical Education.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   According to the latest available ethnic data 26% of the students are Hispanic, 48% Asian and other, 24% Caucasian  and 1% African American. Approximately 18% of the students have individualized educational plans and receive the  full continuum of services (SETSS, Speech, Guidance, Occupational and Physical Therapy). Additionally 32% of the  students are English Language Learners with Chinese as a dominant language. The majority of the students are from  low income families, and all receive free breakfast and lunch.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   P.S. 48 made the most progress over the past year in Collaborative Teachers. According to the 2017-18 School Quality  Guide , 95% of teachers say that at their school the principal, teachers, and staff collaborate to make the school run  effectively. PS. 48'S key focus for the 2018-2019 school year will be strengthening "Strong Family and Community  Ties." It is essential that parents are afforded the opportunity to be active in their children's learning.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 20K048   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,SE   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   593   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 048, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. P.S. 48's school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.S. 048 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, P.S. 48 will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

For these  children, the school provides  programs to improve their  achievement by integrating  explicit and implicit research  based vocabulary instruction.  The school provides mentoring  during the extended day, and   before and after school   programs which support these   students by using ENL   methodology to make content   area material more  comprehensible to   ELLs.  Students in Freestanding   ENL programs come from   different countries and   backgrounds. As per CR Part  154, there are 2 types of ENL:   Stand Alone ENL   and Integrated ENL.  Stand  Alone ENL is instruction to   develop English skills, so that  students can succeed in core  content courses. It is delivered   by a certified ENL teacher.   Integrated ENL is instruction to   build English language skills   through content area   instruction. It is delivered by a  dually certified teacher (ENL  and a content area) or by co- teaching (certified ENL teacher   and a certified content area  teacher (i.e. English language  Arts, Math, Science, or Social  Studies). Both methods of ENL   instruction include content   area subject matter and   English language development  using ENL strategies. Based on  the data we collect on monthly  and unit assessments from the  main programs used (Teachers   College) teachers form  individual instructional   plan.  On the TCRWP, the data  shows our ELL students need  additional development of   academic vocabulary,   phonemic awareness and   decoding skills.  The data also  indicates a need for additional   instruction of strategies to   answer inferential   questions.  There are 173 ENL  students in P.S. 448.   There   are 72 new admits for   kindergarten, 30 of them were  identified as English Language   Learners. 16 of them are   Entering/Emerging level.

There are 6 students who   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      Total         0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   passed the NYSESLAT in grade   four.    962   96 2         Part III: Assessment Analysis       After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following:   1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Classroom assessment serves as a blueprint for teachers for ongoing planning and refinement of instruction. The components  of the assessment tool are aligned to goals, standards and indicators to maximize teachers' ability to gain comprehensive  information about their students.  Periodic assessments are used to evaluate the progress of students and the success of the  programs.  Based on what is gleaned from assessments, teachers can make changes in instruction and/or materials;  assessments are the tools to help determine promotion of students in accordance with the Chancellor's Promotion Policy.   Early literacy skills of ELLs are assessed through use of the Imagine Learning (Computer Program) assessments, and TCRWP.  Based on the data we collect on monthly and unit assessments from the main programs used Imagine Learning and TCRWP,  teachers come up with individual instructional plan.  On the TCRWP, the data shows our ELL students need additional  development of academic vocabulary, phonemic awareness and decoding skills.  The data also indicates a need for additional  instruction of strategies to answer inferential questions. Based on the data we collect on monthly and unit assessments from  the main programs used (Imagine Learning and On Our Way to English) teachers form individual instructional plan.  On the  TCRWP, the data shows that our ELL students need additional development of academic vocabulary, phonemic awareness and  decoding skills.  The data also indicates a need for additional instruction of strategies to answer inferential questions.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The teachers evaluate our students in all four modalities through various formal and informal assessments throughout the  school year to ensure that students are making progress. NYSESLAT tests our students formally in all four language modalities  each spring.  Our students are informally assessed daily for speaking through classroom discussions and formally through  presentations multiple times a year.  The students are tested by asking questions, pointing to pictures, assessing their reading  level (MOSL), and variety of writing assessments such as writing on demands by the TC Teaching model. For listening, students  are informally assessed by responding to questions during read alouds, and also responding to directions and questions in a  classroom situation.  Formal assessment of listening skills is conducted on a monthly basis through use of benchmark unit  assessments.  For reading,we formally assess our students using TCRWP running records and informally assess during daily  guided reading.  Writing is assessed through our use of TCRWP writing component across the genres, their ability to write  essays for the tasks, and writing and responding to short answer questions.  Informal classroom assessments are aligned with  the NYS CCLS.  ELLs' home language and cultures are regarded as assets and are used by the teachers in bridging in prior  knowledge to new knowledge, and in making connections meaningful and comprehensible. Children's new language  development is diagnosed on an on-going basis. Their progress and needs are considered in planning instruction and choosing  instructional materials what while appropriate to their command of the English language allows room for progress as we build  on skills they know. Freestanding English as a new language (ENL) program provides instruction in English with home language  support, emphasizing English language acquisition.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Teachers target academically rigorous and challenging instructional goals, while simultaneously providing students with the  instructional supports they need to achieve success. Progress monitoring data is used to make educational decisions about  changes in goals, instruction, and/or services; as well as whether to consider a referral for special education services. Progress  informs how at-risk students are responding to instruction. Progress monitoring data is used to make educational decisions  about changes in goals, instruction, and/or services; as well as whether to consider a referral for special education services.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      When progress is monitored, the expected rate of an ELL’s progress takes into account language development and  background. The student’s progress is then compared with levels demonstrated by peers from comparable cultural, linguistic,  and experiential backgrounds who have received the same or comparable intervention.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    For each English language learner who scores below specific levels of performance on the annual English language proficiency  assessment, the school determines the additional support services to provide the students, taking into consideration evidence  such as the following: number of years of instruction in a bilingual education or English as a new language program, English  and home literacy, content area and socio-emotional support needs of students with inconsistent/interrupted formal  education (SIFE), English and home language literacy needs of long term ELLs, results from the annual English language  proficiency exam, content area teacher recommendation, parent or guardian request, and sample of student work in English.  Collaboration in the service of jointly constructing knowledge provides students with opportunities to positively engage with  one another and with their teacher around rigorous academic content. Such interactions boost academic development and  academic motivation. Also, our school is developing Language and Literacy across the Curriculum. Language development at all  levels should be fostered through purposeful, deliberate conversation between teacher and students, and among students.  We are making Lessons Meaningful. Teachers leverage students’ funds of knowledge and skills as a foundation for new  knowledge. Quality core instruction necessarily links students’ background knowledge and daily lives to the content at hand,  and provides experiences that show abstract concepts drawn from, and applied to, the everyday world situations.The  Response to Intervention (RtI) model holds significant promise for better serving English Language Learners (ELLs) who are at- risk for academic difficulties. RTI is an instructional model that aims at prevention and early intervention through a tiered  system of instructional support, one that adds layers of instructional support to the standard core curriculum delivered in a  school, based on the demonstrated and changing needs of the student learners. Our students are provided with increasingly  intensive, targeted instruction designed to match their learning needs, as demonstrated by performance on periodically  administered assessments. Our school follows these steps: 1. Universal screening is administered to all students, 2. strong Tier  1, tier 2 instructions, 3. intensive targeted intervention, and 4.  progress monitored.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   As children advance in grade level, achievement in Listening and Speaking improves.  Oral language development progresses  as ELLs increase vocabulary.  Reading and Writing skills emerge in later stages of language acquisition.  As ELLs acquire  Listening and Reading skills, they start to achieve goals in Reading and Writing.  For children at the pre-production stage,  teachers provide opportunities for active listening, and visuals. Students are surrounded with language such as chants, songs  and simple poems. The use of physical movement in language activities (TPR) and the encouragement of art, mime and music  are used throughout the curriculum and are excellent forms of creative expression.  Children at the speech emergent stage of  language acquisition benefit from our teachers focusing on communication in meaningful contexts and the use of asking open- ended questions. Teachers model, expand and enrich student language. At this stage, shared reading, guided reading and  storytelling are very beneficial to language acquisition.  At the intermediate and advanced stages, teachers facilitate more  advanced literature studies and provide opportunities for children to create oral and written narratives. Realistic writing  experiences, such as writing letters, are also used at this stage. Teachers also continue on-going language development  through integrated language arts, scaffolding of instruction and content-area activities.  The ENL teacher makes instruction  comprehensible to ELLs through a variety of means, which may include but not be limited to the use of gestures, visuals, or  concrete examples, and through the routines of the school day.  Materials and activities are meaningful and natural for  learning to occur in a meaningful communicative context. Language skills are assessed and assessment used as a tool for  learners to demonstrate what they have learned by applying it in a new task or problem situation. Students are provided with  the opportunities to participate in communicative use of language in a wide range of activities. Early literacy skills of ELLs are  assessed through use of the Teachers College running records, Imagine Learning (Computer Program) assessments, On Our  Way to English Unit Assessments, and teacher- made assessments. Teachers able to adjust instructions based on students  needs; it is aligned to goals, standards and indicators to maximize students’ ability to gain comprehensive  information.  Periodic assessments are used to evaluate the progress of students and the success of the programs.  Based on  what is gleaned from assessments, teachers can make changes in instruction and/or materials; assessments are also a tool to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      help determine promotion of students in accordance with the Chancellor's Promotion Policy.            6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The school sets clear expectations for teachers regarding collecting, recording, and analyzing soft and hard data along with  analyzing student work.  At the beginning of the school year, ELL students will be screened using a baseline assessment and  TCRWP. We identify resources on how to effectively use information provided by assessments to inform teachers on how to  use the assessment data to drive instruction to meet the specific needs of individual ELL students, small groups of ELL students  and/or whole group. The school develops and implements a process for collaborating with the PPT team to monitor student  movement between Tier I and Tier II. The school uses a push-in/push-out model to support ESL students in content areas to  enhance language development.  Students have access to the ELL computer program Imagine Learning and Raz-Kids.  The  Saturday Program is grouped according to proficiency level.  Staff development is provided for teachers on ELL strategies and  best practices.  Early literacy skills of ELLs are assessed through use of the Teachers College running records, Imagine Learning  (Computer Program) assessments, On Our Way to English Unit Assessments, Raz-Kidz and  teacher- made assessments.  Teachers able to adjust instructions based on students’ needs; it is aligned to goals, standards and indicators to maximize  students’ ability to gain comprehensive information.  Periodic assessments are used to evaluate the progress of students and  the success of the programs.  Based on what is gleaned from assessments, teachers can make changes in instruction and/or  materials; assessments are also a tool to help determine promotion of students in accordance with the Chancellor's Promotion  Policy.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?     According to the amended CR Part 154m, the organizational models used are integrated and stand-alone.  In the integrated  model there are heterogeneous (mixed proficiency levels).  The stand-alone model is homogeneous (organized by grade and  proficiency level).  Students identified as Entering (Beginner) will receive a total 360 minutes per week the breakdown of which  is 180 minutes stand-alone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA.  Students identified as Emerging (Low Intermediate)  will receive a total 360 minutes per week the breakdown of which is 90 minutes standalone ENL, 180 minutes of integrated  ENL/ELA, and 90 minutes minimum of stand-alone or integrated ENL (with ELA or other content area).   Students identified as  Transitioning (Intermediate) will receive a total of 180 minutes per week the breakdown of which is 90 minutes integrated  ENL/ELA and 90 minutes standalone or integrated ENL (with ELA or any other content area).  Students identified as Expanding  (Advanced) will receive a total of 180 minutes of ENL all of which will be integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.  Students  identified as Commanding (Proficient) are entitled to a total of 90 minutes integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.   The school emphasizes small group work in the classes with students because we believe that interaction is essential and  heterogeneity is beneficial.  Teachers have common prep time and they develop work for ELLs together based on data that is  gathered from classes.  Teachers also work together on student management.  We regularly review data which enables us to  maintain the program and/or to propose changes that will ensure the acceleration of their students’ accomplishments.  A variety of tools and resources are used by the school to organize and analyze data.   Classroom instruction and grouping are  strategic, timely, and responsive.  Flexible grouping for academic intervention, differentiation, and integrating ELLs into  heterogeneous classes is practiced based on student needs and learning targets.  Our school is using two teaching models:  Push in and Pull out. Pull-out ENL is a program model that allows ELL students be taken out of their classes for one or two  periods a day to receive ENL instruction in smaller class sizes with students of similar proficiency levels. ENL teachers  incorporate intensive vocabulary, phonics and grammar instruction to enable them access to academic content. ENL teachers  work closely with classroom teachers and differentiate instructions to ensure that the students receive same instructions  during the pull out services. Push-in ENL model is when the ENL teacher and the classroom teacher work and plan together to  insure that students receive instructions and understand the lesson. 1. Team-Teaching  The ENL teacher and the ELA teacher take turns delivering and focusing on providing scaffolding and addressing more basic  skills. The ENL teacher also provides ideas and materials for differentiating and scaffolding classroom teacher written lessons.  In this model, the ENL teacher is the expert on making the content area material accessible to all learners. In Small-Group  Instruction Model, the ENL teacher pulls a small group during the independent work time to reinforce or re-teach a skill. In  One-on-One Instruction Model, the ENL teacher provides the one-on-one instruction to assess student’s reading and writing   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         skills during independent reading time or independent work time. Stand-alone ENL is instruction to develop English language  skills so that students can succeed in core content courses. It is delivered by a certified ENL teacher. A variety of tools and  resources, such as graphic organizers, visuals, picture books, are used by the school to organize and analyze data.   Classroom  instruction and grouping are strategic, timely, and responsive.  Flexible grouping for academic intervention, differentiation,  and integrating ELLs into heterogeneous classes is practiced based on student needs and learning targets.                Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   N/A     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      According to the amended CR Part 154, the organizational models used are integrated and stand-alone.  In the  integrated model there are heterogeneous (mixed proficiency levels).  The stand-alone model is organized by grade  and proficiency level.  Students identified as Entering (Beginner) will receive a total 360 minutes per week the  breakdown of which is 180 minutes stand-alone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA.  Students identified as  Emerging (Low Intermediate) will receive a total 360 minutes per week the breakdown of which is 90 minutes  standalone ENL, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA, and 90 minutes minimum of stand-alone or integrated ENL (with  ELA or other content area).  Students identified as Transitioning (Intermediate) will receive a total of 180 minutes per  week the breakdown of which is 90 minutes integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes standalone or integrated ENL (with  ELA or any other content area).  Students identified as Expanding (Advanced) will receive a total of 180 minutes of ENL  all of which will be integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.   Every child identified as ENL receives full  services.  Each ENL teacher has a program that incorporates full coverage depending on the students’ mandated  allotted time.         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Curriculum by grade is followed by content areas using ENL methodology and CCLS. The content areas (math, science and  social studies) are interrelated.  Thematic organization helps the ENL teachers connect the different content areas during the  day.  Math lessons reinforce and expand the concepts and language introduced in content area lesson.  Stories read during ELA  time are used to unify and develop academic vocabulary. ENL teachers work with classroom teachers in planning literacy  instruction aligned with CCLS as well as content area instruction.  ENL teachers also take part in grade curriculum meetings and  individual grade meetings.  This ensures coherence in instruction while aligning to the Common Core Learning Standards. The  materials used in the ENL program are Imagine Learning, Reading A to Z, Raz-Kidz which are  computer based programs used  throughout the school.  They are language and literacy software programs that feature interactive activities, videos, and  games. It’s research-based and instructionally differentiated. TCRWP is the reading program used by our ENL  Teachers.  Domain-based instruction includes a focus on academic language and vocabulary development; thematic, content- based instruction; differentiated instruction for language and literacy; and a daily instructional routine in oral language,  reading, and writing. Engaging online tools using SMART Board technology, IPADS, and computers to motivate English  language learners.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   By mandate all Spanish speaking children first admitted to the NYC system are tested in English by the LAB-R and, if not  proficient in English, they are tested also in Spanish by the Spanish LAB as required by mandate. The parent on the home  language survey indicates how much prior education, if any, the student has received. ENL teachers with groups of ELLs who  have a common native language organize collaborative tasks that target content and generate interactions in the native  language.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?        SIFE students are given the same intervention services to help them catch-up in the academic areas.  SIFE students are pulled- out for small group instruction to maximize literacy development and learning time for the student.  Although the student may  lack literacy skills, they bring prior knowledge and experience that should be acknowledged and built upon.  Our plan includes  an interdisciplinary thematic approach to curriculum development structure and a supportive learning environment.  Native  language books are available for both students and parents.    Newcomers who are newly arrived from other countries and cultures are surrounded by an inviting environment with teachers  who show genuine interest in the students, their language and culture. Teachers also use a "buddy" system, so that newcomer  children do not feel isolated and sensitize English speaking students to the newcomers' challenges. Teachers establish a regular  routine with newcomers, which is an important strategy in creating an inviting school environment. In the beginning stages of  language acquisition, teachers make language comprehensible by using strategies which convey meaning.  Teachers rely on  other than language cues to clarify meanings that might not be apparent to the student.  Children are also invited to attend  after-school programs such as Compass which provides academic support and extracurricular activities which help develop the  child's communication, language, social skills.  PS 48 has established a welcoming committee and a “New Comers Club” with  ENL teachers and the guidance counselor acting as staff facilitators to help welcome new admits.  Computer programs  (Imagine Learning, RazKids, Mathletics) and audio books are used for English practice. We are continuously extend both class  and school libraries to include more books in other languages, so that newcomers do not feel excluded from enjoying reading.     Developing and Long-term ELLs may appear fluent. However, they need language support to make gains in language and  content area. They are identified and receive interventions which target their area of need.  These interventions  include AIS services in Reading and Math, At-Risk Resource Room and the Saturday Day Academy Program.  Teachers use  scaffolding and continue to use extra linguistic cues to support language.  Students at this level are given the opportunity for  more language input.  Teachers differentiate their instruction by using lessons that scaffold academic language. Teachers also  use flexible grouping to differentiate instruction for Developing and Long Term ELLs because it provides students with the  opportunity to work with others that have similar learning styles, readiness, or interests.     Former ELLs as per CR Part 154 are entitled to at least a half unit of integrated ENL and additional support through AIS services,  Saturday Academy  and the state mandated test accommodations. ELLs who test commanding/proficient in years one and two  after testing proficient will receive support from the ESL teacher. At this time the ESL teacher uses the push-in model to help  support the needs of a student who scored proficient in the spring. The classroom teacher and the ESL teacher discuss these  students in the beginning of the year in order to make the teacher aware of the child’s ELL status as well as academic  challenges. The classroom teacher closely monitors ELLs for academic support. Depending upon the purpose of the lesson,  teachers plan their activities based on student needs, then use flexible grouping to group students accordingly. Also, teachers  adjust their questions (DOK) and level of complexity based on what fits that particular child. Teachers use Bloom’s Taxonomy  to develop queries from the very basic to the more advanced. This is a great way for teachers to design a more effective  curriculum for students at different levels on the learning spectrum. In addition, we break them into differentiated groups  according to data. One of the ways we differentiate instruction is giving our students  options based on student interest or  learning style. They  are given choices as to what will be learned or how they will learn the information. Options  include   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      activities, learning centers, independent study, partnerships,and small group projects.. Choice activities are well-known for  improving student’s motivation based on their needs.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    ELL-SWDs receive the mandated ENL services. ENL teachers review IEP requirements for students in special needs  programs.  Two of our three ENL teachers are NYS licensed Special Education teachers.   The school provides bilingual paras for  SWDs.  P.S. 48 does not have a TBE program since parents have regularly selected ENL. The technology used to support ELLs  includes Imagine Learning as well as Raz-Kidz which are computer based program used throughout the school.  These are  language and literacy software programs that feature interactive activities, videos, and games. It’s research-based and  instructionally differentiated.  TCRWP is our Reading Program for Grades K-5.  It is a comprehensive English language  development program.  Domain-based instruction includes a focus on academic language and vocabulary development;  thematic, content-based instruction; differentiated instruction for language and literacy; and a daily instructional routine in  oral language, reading, and writing     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Being aware of SWDs IEP requirements, ENL push-in teachers collaborate with classroom teachers in setting up curricular and  instructional lesson plans aligned with the CCLS, to target the diverse needs of each of these students.  The ELL SWDs, in pull- out programs, are mainstreamed and are serviced with the ELLs on their grade level.  When accessing the least restrictive  environment ELL-SWDs have the same opportunities as the general education student. Our ICT classes use the Imagine  Learning computer program for all ELL students including those who are SWD.  Grade trips and projects include all ELL/SWDs  students with non-disabled peers.   Our ELL -SWD students are programmed in Collaborate ICT classes where they are  mainstreamed with the general population. They are provided with leveled texts to better accommodate their reading and  comprehension levels. They are heterogeneously grouped to afford greater opportunities in meeting their long and short term  goals. Utilizing the Individualized Educational Plans teachers become familiar with students testing accommodations to better  provide students with the ability to demonstrate mastery of skills and attainment of knowledge without being limited due to  the effects of their disability.  Freestanding English as a new language programs provide instructions in English with home  language support, emphasizing English language acquisition. As per CR Part 154 our school is using 2 types of ENL. Stand Alone  ENL model is to develop English language skills so that students can succeed in core content courses. The instructions delivered  by certified ENL teachers. ENL teachers plan together with general education or/and special education teachers to ensure  curricular alignment and continuity of instructions.  Integrated ENL is instructional model to build English language skills  through content area instruction. It is delivered by a certified teacher (ENL and a content area) or co-teaching by a certified  teacher and a certified content area teacher (i.e., English language arts, math, science, or social studies). The ENL teachers  work in collaboration general education and special education classroom teachers to provide language acquisition and  vocabulary support, scaffolding instructions. The ELL/SWDs have equal access to grade trips and projects. Our ICT classes use  the Imagine Learning, Raz-Kidz, Reading A to Z to provide support and scaffolding instructions with Ells and SWD students. All  ELLs, former ELL and ELL–SWD up to 2 years after exiting ELL status receive a minimum number of units of Integrated ENL.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Effective instructional approaches vary and depend on such factors as student’s age. These intervention programs  include AIS Reading and Math, Speech, Wilson Language Program, Fundations, Saturday Academy, Speech Improvement, At- Risk Resource Room, Counseling and Compass After-School Program.  The school uses the interim assessments, Math  & ELA tasks for ELLs to better target the deficiencies of individual students.  Extended day programs utilize ENL materials and  strategies used by certified ENL teachers. The programs also use analysis of the individual student's NYSESLAT scores, so that   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      teachers may focus on the children’s needs. Long-term ELLs may appear fluent, but are making progress in their English ability  according to their levels.  These students need language support to make gains in language and content area.  They are  identified and receive AIS services in Reading and Math, At-Risk Resource Room and Extended Day services. Newcomers who  are newly arrived from other countries and cultures are surrounded by a supportive environment with teachers who show  genuine interest in the students, their language and culture. Teachers also use a "buddy" system so that newcomer children do  not feel isolated and sensitize English speaking students to the newcomers' challenges. Teachers establish a regular routine  with newcomers, which is an important strategy in creating a low anxiety environment. In the beginning stages of language  acquisition, teachers make language comprehensible by using strategies which convey meaning.  Teachers rely on other than  language cues to clarify meanings that might not be apparent to the student.  Children are also invited to attend after-school  programs such as Compass which provides academic support and extracurricular activities which help develop the child's  communication, language, and social skills.  PS 48 has established a welcoming committee and a “New comers Club” with ENL  teachers and the guidance counselor acting as staff facilitators to help welcome new admits.  Computer programs and books  with tapes are used for English practice. We are continuously extending both class and school libraries to include more books  in other languages so that newcomers do not feel excluded from enjoying reading.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our school will continue to use instructional approaches and intervention programs such as:  AIS Reading and Math, Speech,  Wilson Language Program-Fundations, Raz-Kidz, Go Math, Reading A to Z, Speech Improvement, At-Risk Resource Room,  Counseling and One World After-School Program.  Extended day programs utilize ENL materials and strategies used by certified  ENL teachers. The programs also use analysis of the individual student's NYSESLAT scores so that teachers may focus on the  children’s needs. The school also uses the interim assessments for ELLs to better target the deficiencies of individual students.  All these are offered for the diverse ELL sub-groups. Because of changes on the NYSESLAT, we are looking into new NYSESLAT  test prep material.  We are also evaluating all programs to ensure compatibility with the CCLS and exploring additional  programs which are compatible.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We do not have bilingual program at this time.  No programs will be discontinued for this school year.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   ELLs have equal access to all school programs as well as computer interactive programs such as Imagine Learning English, Raz- Kidz.  Students are taught language arts through the Teachers College Reading and Writing Program. ENL classrooms have  leveled libraries particularly aimed at the second language learner.  The school has acquired programs from Rigby Publishers  and Hampton-Brown Publishers.  These are comprehensive programs which focus on language, literacy and content  areas.  Other materials used are poetry and song charts, Smart boards, iPads, LEA charts, interactive journals, wordless books,  pattern books,and computer programs. Teachers use ENL strategies to promote language development.  Such strategies  include the use of visuals, audio and recording equipment,  and repetition.  ENL classrooms are also resource centers available  to the entire school.  The use of appropriate materials and strategies in the ENL rooms and push-in rooms are central to the  children’s language development.  All materials and resources are grade and age appropriate.  All materials and resources are grade and age appropriate. Freestanding English as a new language (ENL) program provide  instruction in English with home language support, emphasizing English language acquisition. Student in Freestanding ENL  programs come from different countries and backgrounds. As per CR Part 154, there are 2 types of ENL: Stand Alone ENL is  instruction to develop English skills so that students can succeed in core content courses. It is delivered by a certified ENL  teacher. Integrated ENL is instruction to build English language skills through content area instruction. It is delivered by a dually  certified teacher (ENL and a content area) or co-teaching by a certified ENL teacher and a certified content area teacher (i.e.  English language arts, math, science, or social studies). Both methods of ENL instructions include content area subject matter  and English language development using ENL strategies.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  The materials used in the ENL program are Imagine learning which a computer is based program used throughout the  school.  It is a language and literacy software program that features interactive activities, videos, and games. It’s research- based and instructionally differentiated. TCRWP is a comprehensive Reading/Writing program.   Domain-based instruction  includes a focus on academic language and vocabulary development; thematic, content-based instruction; differentiated  instruction for language and literacy; and a daily instructional routine in oral language, reading, and writing. Engaging online  and digital tools motivate English language learners.   Effective instructional approaches vary and depend on such factors as student’s age. These intervention programs include AIS  Reading and Math, Speech, Wilson Language Program, Fundations Program, Speech Improvement, At-Risk Resource Room,  Counseling and One World After-School Program.  Extended day programs utilize ENL materials and strategies used by certified  ENL teachers. The programs also use analysis of the individual student's NYSESLAT scores so that teachers may focus on the  children’s needs. The school also uses the interim assessments for ELLs to better target the deficiencies of individual students. .  All these are offered for the diverse ELL sub-groups.  SIFE students are given the same intervention services to help them catch-up in the academic areas.  SIFE students are pulled- out for small group instruction to maximize literacy development and learning time for the student.  Although the student may  lack literacy skills, they bring prior knowledge and experience that should be acknowledged and built upon.  Our plan includes  an interdisciplinary thematic approach to curriculum development structure and a supportive learning environment.  Native  language books are available for both students and parents.  Long-term and Developing ELLs (may appear fluent, but are making progress in their English ability at a slow pace.  These  students need language support to make gains in language and content area. They are identified and receive interventions  which target their area of need.  These interventions include AIS services in Reading and Math, At-Risk Resource Room and  Extended Day services.  Teachers use scaffolding and continue to use extra linguistic cues to support language.  Students at this  level are given the opportunity for more language input.  Teachers differentiate their instruction by using lessons that scaffold  academic language.  Former ELLs as per CR Part 154 are entitled to at least a half unit of integrated ENL and additional support through AIS services,  Saturday Academy, Extended Day and the state mandated test accommodations.  Newcomers who are newly arrived from other countries are also invited to attend after-school programs such as One -World  which provides academic support and extracurricular activities which help develop the child's communication, language, social  skills.  Native language books are available in the school library.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   P.S. 48 have an extensive library of Native Language Books and translations are easily given to parents and children when  asked.  Parents are asked which language they prefer for communication within the school and all efforts are made to  accommodate the individual needs.  Our ENL program  supports native language by providing variety of fiction and non-fiction  books, glossaries, dictionaries, picture dictionaries, videos,  translators when needed and materials in native languages if  requested.  Also, NYS test accommodations for content area tests allow for translated editions or translated reading of the  tests.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Our classrooms have extensive leveled libraries that span across the grades and age levels.  Students also have access to the  school library which has books on different reading levels and appealing genres.  Our ENL classroom libraries have leveled  books from Rigby's - On Our Way to English.  The TESOL teachers work across the grade spans and attend the same  professional development and grade meetings as our general education teachers so that they are aware of the resources and  support that each classroom has available to them.  This also gives them the opportunity to best address the needs of the ELL  students and better serve them.  ELLs have equal access to all school programs.  These programs include Band, Chorus, and  participation in Art Project and a fourth grade Dance class.  All students are invited to our Compass After school Program which  is run by FIAO.   A Saturday Literacy and Math Academy will be instituted this school year.           14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68      The materials used in the ENL program are Imagine learning which a computer is based program used throughout the  school.

If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Orientations are held for newly registered kindergarten children before the first day of school.  Parents are invited and receive  welcome packets with useful information as to support staff, routines and expectations.  Newcomers who are newly arrived  from other countries and cultures are surrounded by a low anxiety environment with teachers who show genuine interest in  the students, their language and culture. Teachers also use a "buddy" system so that newcomer children do not feel isolated  and sensitize English speaking students to the newcomers' challenges. Teachers establish a regular routine with newcomers,  which is an important strategy in creating a low anxiety environment.  PS 48 has established a welcoming committee and a  “Newcomers Club” with TESOL teachers,  the guidance counselor and parents coordinator acting as staff facilitators to help  welcome new admits. Computer programs and books with tapes are used for English practice. Also, our school individually  meets with the parents or guardians of English language learners in addition to parent-teacher conferences, initial parent  orientations, quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled meetings provided for parents or guardians, to  discuss the goals of the program, their child’s language development progress, their child’s English language proficiency  assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. This additional meeting include school staff  necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the child’s language development in all content areas in  English.

Our school provides  professional development to ENL teachers to address the needs of English language learners, focuses on  best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrated language and content instruction for English  language learners.  Workshops for staff include reviewing ELL Standards, Language Acquisition Levels, NYSESLAT and how to  incorporate ENL methodologies in the mainstream classroom. Network Level workshops will provide  targeted professional development that is focused around best practices with regard to ELL  instruction.  In addition, staff development also provides information and activities on how to integrate  new immigrant students into the classroom environment.       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  We will utilize an Educational Consultant and ENL coordinator to provide ongoing direct curriculum and strategy development  for the minimum of 15% of total hrs. of training.  Coaching, lessons design, and planning facilitate implementation of new and  effective practices. Academic language development, differentiation, and scaffolding strategies, as well as cultural sensitivity,  were some of the areas targeted for professional development.  Professional staff developers from CITE (the Center for Integrated Teacher Education), Network Level workshops and Jakayla  Consultants have been invited to provide training sessions for staff to assist ELLs as they transition from elementary to middle  school. These professionals provide workshops for the parents of these students so that helping the children transition to  middle school is a team effort on the part of school and family.  These team workshops are also offered in the evening in order  to facilitate parent attendance.  Division of English Language Learners & Student Support and Brooklyn South ELL Support  Team provide monthly Professional development for ENL and all teachers. Weekly department meetings are also held with the  ENL teachers, coaches, Assistant Principal and educational consultant.

Teachers at PS 48 always start parent teacher conferences with a positive input. It is important to start meetings/conferences  on a  positive note. Teachers are always prepared and have assessment results available for the parents as well as students’  sample of work in class. Teachers use the ELL Data Analysis Tool, conference notes,and The New Language Arts Progression to  scaffold and plan appropriate instruction for their ELL students.  It is important to involve parents with ongoing meetings. In  addition to parent-teacher conferences, we provide parents or guardians’ initial parent orientations, quarterly progress  meetings to discuss the goals of the program, their child’s language development progress and child’s English language  proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. PS 48 provides individual conferences  and meet with the parents or guardians of English language learners. Teachers also conduct individual meetings with parents  of ELLs during our Tuesday parent engagement time. The classroom teacher and the ENL teacher schedule meetings with the  parent(s) of the ELL students in order to discuss goals, language development, and progress as well as next steps. The  classroom teacher and the ENL teacher discuss the agenda prior to the meeting.  These additional meetings include school  staff necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the child’s language development in all content areas in  English and in the child’s home language. Such meetings are conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the language  or mode of communication the parent or guardian best understands. We have teachers in our school who translate languages  such as Spanish, Urdu, Arabic, Chinese, and Russian.  If an interpreter or translation is needed the translation and  interpretation unit is contacted and arrangements are made. Also, during the parents’ teacher conference, teachers discuss  language progression of the students.        Parental Involvement   1.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Parents are asked which language they prefer for communication to/ and from school. Home Language Surveys  are used to determine what languages are spoken in the home. Based on these and other ATS reports such as the  Home Language Aggregation Report, Biographical Data Reports, Place of Birth Report, Biographical Roster Report  the translation and oral interpretation needs of the parents are accessed and appropriate information is acquired.  We also use the services provided by the Department of Education Translations Unit and Outreach to parents by  the Parent Coordinator. Parents receive notifications of upcoming meeting and events in their home language.  The translation and Interpretation Unit supports families who need help with communication in English. Our  school offers free interpretation services which can be given to families by asking the school administration  and/or parent coordinator. The Unit offers written translation, on-site, and over the phone services. The HLIS  includes an interview with the parents to determine the home language. This is part of the general registration  procedure. The Translation and Interpretation Unit and the school designated access coordinator are used as  representatives to assist with parents’ communication.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75         2.
