This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The school has a focus on design education and is committed to creating an environment that empowers students  with the skills, tools and capacities to be successful and happy after high school.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    New Design High School (NDHS) is a 9-12 school located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan serving 430 students.  The student population is 88% Black and Hispanic and 55% female. 25% of the population have Individual Educational  Plans. Over 70% of students are eligible for free lunch. The average incoming ELA proficiency in English is 2.36 and  Math proficiency is 2.16 placing most students below grade level in reading and math when they enter the school.   The school has set a goal of achieving plus 90% in the following areas: graduation rate, attendance, course pass rates  and Regents pass rates. We call this our “360 Goal.” The school is making significant progress in these goals. The  school achieved a 90% graduation rate in the 2017-2018 year for the second year in a row. The attendance rate  climbed for the 4th consecutive year in a row to 86.5%. US History and English Regents are at or above 80% for our  11th grade students. The school also have above 90% course pass rates for all grade levels.    The focus moving forward is to meet all of our 360 goals. Specifically, improving course pass rates in Regents based  courses and regents pass rates on the Living Environment and Global History examinations. The school is also  committed to aligning instructional practices across departments and in grade level teams. The focus will be on the  following areas: reading and writing instruction, group problem solving strategies, discussion frameworks and  common and shared academic standards.    The school spent 2017-2018 school year continuing to improve its attendance with a focus on more support for long  term absent students. Attendance has improved slightly over the last two years but more resources will be channeled  toward improving attendance. The school will continue to partnering with New Visions on data tools and has created  a new position, Director of Systems and Accountability, to help leverage those tools. The school also rolled out a new  attendance system which includes the text message service Kinvo to improve communication between families and  the school about student attendance. The 2018-2019 school year will be the 1st year Kinvo will be in use for the entire  year.   Course pass rates above 90% are still a challenge for our Regents based courses. A number of new support initiatives  will be improved on this year to improve instruction including the teaching of literacy skills across academic  departments using our CCEAL writing structure, RAID reading strategy and GPS discussion structure. A new Chief  Academic Officer (CAO) position has been created to help with academic support structures. The CAO responsibilities  include improving the effectiveness of a number of academic support structures including Retro Rewind, Extended  Semester, Early Summer School, Winter School and Spring Break school. The school will also work hard to improve its  academic support systems including the Literacy Intervention Team, Math Intervention Team, Extended Semester,  Retro Rewind and Office Hours.    New Design is on the verge of being an elite school in New York City serving under-served students. The school's  Educational Option Admission Policy ensures the school serves a very challenging and needy population of students.  The Class of 2017 and Class of 2018 graduation rate are at 90% is evidence the school is on that path. There are over  50 New York City Department Education High Schools with Educational Option Admission policies and only three  achieved a graduation rate of above 90%.    The school will also be dedicating more resources to the improving feedback to teacher to improve their practice. A  Chief of Instruction position has been created and will be staffed with a teacher leader in order to coordinate the  professional development systems and structures at the school including the development of a peer teacher feedback  system as well as supporting developing teachers in their curriculum development.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Data analysis from the end of the year suggest more efforts need to be put into improving the effectiveness of  students in their Regents classes. The number of students receiving 10+ credits dramatically increased in the 2017- 2018 school year but Regents Course pass rates are 10% lower than non Regents classes. 9th Grade Living  Environment and 10th Grade Global Regents scores are still low. Students need a targeted approach that includes  academic skill building, social and emotional development and high levels of academic mentoring. The school is  addressing these grades specifically by focusing on improving the school's Design for Life Program. The program  fosters social and emotional growth in students to support their academic achievement. The program consists of a  four year sequence of Design for Life classes with a focus on students receiving the academic, social and emotional  supports they need at each grade level to be successful. Design for Life Initiatives also include a school-wide coaching  program that ensures each student receives academic advisement and life coaching weekly from staff. Students also  meet in Council Circles each week to promote peer to peer learning and foster the healthy development of emotional  growth. The program will be adding a College and Career Counselor for the 9th and 10th grades as well as improve  the level of collaboration among the D4L teachers and the academic content teachers who classes lead to Regents  testing. Low skilled readers are in need to particular support and the school has created a Literacy Intervention Team  to address their needs.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The school has created significant time for staff collaboration and professional development with grade level teams,  academic departments, cross curricular teacher driven professional developments and advisory teams meeting  regularly.

New Design High School's (NDHS) 4 year graduation rate for the Class of 2018 is near 90% and the 6th year graduation  rate for the Class of 2019 is above 90%. As mentioned, very few Educational Option schools meet that criteria. We  also had over 95% of our 11th grade students pass the ELA Common Core Regents with all students with IEPs passing.  Over 85% also passed the United States History exam. Over 80% of 10th grade students passed the Common Core  Algebra exam.    The priority moving forward is on increasing pass rates for the Living Environment and Global History exams as well  improving attendance to above 90%. Attendance continued to be below the 90% target with only 60% of students  achieving greater than 90% attendance. Course pass rates have been low especially for 10th graders with the credits  being earned by students in the Lowest Third especially concerning. The College and Career (CCR) statistics for the  school for Class 2018 raised significantly but work is still needed to be done with the Class of 2019. The priority will  also be on improving the communication with families as well as their partnership in their teenager's academic  success.

New Design High School's Principal and Assistant Principal are founders of the school with 15 years of experience and  leadership at the school. To nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, leadership has been distributed to  multiple staff members with 3 teachers sitting on the Administrative Cabinet and teaching staff assuming leadership  roles as Grade Level Team Leaders, POD Facilitators and Academic Department Chairs. The Quality Reviewer found  area 3.4 to be Well Developed and an area of celebration. The QR Reviewer wrote, "School leaders consistently  communicate high expectations of professionalism and instruction to the entire staff and provide training." Cited in  the QR were examples such as Doctor Notes, Advance Observations, 21 Jump Street and inter-visitations as ways the  school are nurturing staff. Shared leadership hopes to increase the coordinated efforts to meet school goals. Higher  levels of coordination and collaboration are needed to meet the school's "360 Goals" and by distributing leadership  more staff members will be responsible for these goals. 17-18 data was lower than desired in the areas of graduation  rate, course pass rates, attendance and Regents pass rates.

CAS efforts refer to events that are meant to enriching all New  Design community members including parents, students, staff as well as community members. CAS efforts are based  on low data trends. For example, students report that they would like to have a more connection to teaching staff. A  series of CAS has been planned for each grade such as grade level trips and potlucks.    In order to create a welcoming environment for families the school communicates through a number of tools  including REMIND (text based communication system), SKEDULA (online grade book system), School Messenger  (automated calling system for absences and lateness) as well as consistent communication from student coaches to  students and families. The school has partnered with a number of organizations to increase supports in order to  improve academic achievement. Services include college and career counseling as well as social work services. The  school also has a number of partnerships with art and design organizations to enrich the design programming at the  school. The school also organizes a number of community art events such as Rooftop Legends and Rooftop Films in  order to bring community members into the school building.    Similar to many New York City high schools that serve students from all five boroughs, New Design is challenged to  keep families involved in their teens' academic lives. Other than outreach efforts, and events such as Parent College  Night, the school has expanded the student coaching program to ensure every New Design student receives the adult  mentoring and the support needed to be successful in high school and adolescence.

All teachers assess  students via a course "milestone" which accounts for 30% of students grades. Milestones are summative assessments.  Each department has a teacher who facilitates the departments professional development days and supports the  milestones process. Those facilitators meet monthly as an Instructional Team with the principal to determine  professional development around assessments.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33        Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. New Design High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title 1, Part A  of the Every Student Succeeds (ESSA) act is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are welcomed to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      New Design High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ●providing resources to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level including access to  students grades via Pupil Path, invitation to Student Led Conferences and important academic information through  data sources such the school administrated Scholastic Reading Inventory (SRI).

Mentors provide parents with contact information and touch base quarterly.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      ●providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments through parent  meetings with Grade Level Deans throughout the year.   ●sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand through email communication and monthly parent letters.    ●providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community.   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ●actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact by inviting parents to meet with the school's Administration  Cabinet the 3rd Thursday of every month;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement.   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ●maintain a Parent Coordinator (Michael Casiano) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  When students first come to NDHS, we administer initial assessments in each content area that are Common Core aligned. We  also administer the SRI (Scholastic Aptitude Inventory) reading test and re-administer this computerized test every semester to  track progress in reading levels. On the English preliminary assessment, there is also a questionnaire and verbal interview in  which students are asked about their experiences with school, including their comfort level in writing/reading vs  speaking/listening in their first or home language. We increasingly use native language tests such as the Chinese Reading Test  and the ELE to assess strengths and weaknesses in the students' native language(s).      Last year we learned that out of four intermediate level Chinese- speaking ELLs, only two had academic proficiency in  written/read Chinese.  This informed instruction in content classes because glossaries and online translation were not effective  for these students unless the vocabulary was spoken.  Different groupings were devised to facilitate interaction between  speaking/listening proficient students and writing/reading proficient students and text to speech software was used for   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Chinese text. This resulted in three out of four moving from Transitional to Expanding.      We also learned that two new students from West Africa had only received academic instruction in French. Therefore,  vocabulary instruction was paired with English spelling rules and French grammar translation in English class. Flexible  scheduling was implemented to allow for multi-grade sections so that students with common language background could work  together. New Chinese-speaking students were also scheduled into classes so they could receive intensive phonics  intervention and native language support because of recent immigration.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The ENL teacher assesses ELL students in their Design for Life classes so as not to remove them from content area periods. This  information is relayed in bi-weekly grade-level and department meetings with content teachers during which time individual  student intervention plans are written directly into our Hex Data Tool which also pulls data from ATS, Kinvo and Skedula.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Of the ELLs who have been with us for four years, most (80%) reach Expanding or Commanding levels at the end of their 10   th   or 11th grade years. Long-term ELLs and new arrivals are the exception to this rule and we are continually developing the  Design for Life program to address this issue. This year long-term ELLs and ELLs identified as needing extra support in 9th and  10th grade will undergo a formal Response to Intervention program that uses the ELL Periodic Assessment and WADE  Assessment to measure progress. ELLs and formal ELLs in 9th and 10th grade who have been identified for intervention are  scheduled into one extra period of small-group, individualized support with the ELA staff or the reading intervention teacher  (in addition to their mandated ENL minutes). We hope that this added intervention will increase first-time pass rates on ELA,  global and science Regents exams. Last year we piloted this intervention in the upper grades and  11th and 12th  grade NYSESLAT and ELA Regents pass rates exhibited a strong upward curve for both ELLs and ELL/IEP students. However, we  are seeing a negative trend in Global History pass rates from last year so this year we have opened two sections of global prep  for students who are behind in their social studies credits due to language and have scheduled all ELLs and former ELLs into  Design for Life sections that provide extra global history review.    NYSESLAT scores, SRI reading assessments, Milestone pass rates and retake rates as well as anecdotal reports from student-led  conferences are considered in determining academic need and progress. EDAT and RNMR data are also considered because  they allow us to look at different subgroups such as length of English language study and progress in different modalities.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Support and academic structures can be increased if need is evident.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   ELL students will be given the NYSITELL tests initially (if they are newcomers) and the NYSESLAT at the end of the year as well  as interim assessments.   All students at New Design are also tested in the first two weeks of school to determine math and  literacy levels. The math department administers a Math Qualifying Exam and the support department administers the SRI, the  Scholastic Reading Inventory. They are then retested twice during the year with Scholastic Aptitude Test software to monitor  progress in reading.  Additionally, each department administers a quarterly Milestone Exam, our school's unique, assessment  alternative that provides vital data on content knowledge and academic skills and charts improvement over time via Common  Core Standards.  Students cannot progress until explicit learning standards are reviewed and achieved. If a student doesn't  pass a Milestone assessment with at least a B, he or she must spend time in small groups reviewing and come to teachers'  weekly "office hours" outside of class until they pass the assessment. The ENL teacher administers this test with the social  studies and English departments, gaining valuable information from students' scores on the modality categories. These  assessments are not only for the teachers' information, but are also a teaching tool, as students review their performance on  the rubric four times a year, giving them measurable feedback over time and saving their work in their Online Portfolio. This  year we added the 9th Grade Baseline Assessment in Writing which is administered September and January. The results of this  assessment inform the groups for RTI rotation.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43            Our new tool, the Hex Planner, charts student progress in six categories and pulls data automatically from ATS and Skedula.  During September our 9th grade small-group intervention program facilitators are being trained to interpret data from the Hex  planner, Skedula and SESIS in order to track and document interventions school-wide. Next year this intervention protocol will  be expanded to 10th grade global and 11th grade ELA.  SESIS and the EDAT tool supplement our Hex Planner which measures  current grades, skills assessments and previous academic history and is available to every teacher.  Additionally, all teachers  are shared on a support department "Testing Modifications, IEP and ELL Instructional Strategies Spreadsheet" that has  individualized plans for each student in the school, including current grades, effective instructional approaches, Regents and  credit accumulation information and home outreach information.  The EDAT data is relayed to teachers via email in a  biographical paragraph describing each student at the beginning of the year. This information is also discussed in grade-level  and department-level meetings as well as in the ENL after-school professional development pod. All teachers are required to  update each student's data fields in the program, so that numerical data are combined with informal observations and  anecdotal reports in Skedula. This information allows us to see how students are performing across content areas and adjust  intervention strategies and school support as necessary.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   RLAT and RNMR data show an increase in proficiency from Speaking/Listening proficiency to Reading and Writing in 9th 10th  and 11th grades. This may be due to increased Common Core argumentative writing support and new co-teaching  arrangements which added increased support in the form of a rotating pull-out system from integrated English Language Arts  classes. However, reading comprehension in 11th and 12th grades was not increased as in previous years and we have a  number of students in 12th grade who are receiving extra intervention in writing because their scores on social studies  Regents exams lag behind ELA, math and science.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Teaching staff and support review data in Grade Level Team and departmental meetings throughout the year.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   9  th   grade students are grouped into an ELL cohort, which is combined with a smaller mainstream ELA class,  allowing for implementation of the "integrated model." This class meets for twice as many periods as a mainstream  ELA class in order to accommodate ELL scheduling needs and one Response to Intervention period. This arrangement  allows for maximum units of  instruction (540 minutes for Entering level students and 360 minutes for Emerging  students) to be delivered in "stand alone" pull-out groups as well as an "integrated ENL" class environment for  Transitioning and Expanding students. Because this class meets twice daily, four times a week, (allowing for small  group pull-out rotations and extra ELA support), students receive four English credits instead of two for this class. This  creates flexibility in ELL students' overall credit accumulation progress, facilitating flexible scheduling throughout their  high school career based on their progress and re-leveling.     9th   graders also attend an additional Design for Life class, which supports goal-setting, college and career planning  and academic coaching. In the event that a student is an Entering Level newcomer, the Design for Life class provides  an opportunity to schedule extra intervention hours. If there are several newcomers as in previous years, a new   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44         section is opened during this class and students attend a Freestanding ENL class instead of Design for Life in addition  to their "integrated model" ENL/ELA class.     9th  ,10th  , 11th   and 12th grade Commanding Level Former-ELLs are also scheduled into parallel-schedule Design for  Life classes so they can receive their mandated 90 minutes of language support. Sometimes these groupings are  multi-grade because of scheduling restrictions. This arrangement allows the ELL staff to support Commanding level  students and former-ELLs across the curricula without pulling them from their content classes. This also ensures that  the ENL and Reading Intervention staff have consistent access to students during the same blocks each week.     10  th   graders are scheduled into co-taught ELA classes that meet at the same time as Design for Life sections so that  the ELL teacher can offer ELA support in the form of "integrated ELA class" heterogeneous groupings of non-ELLs and  ELLs. This year we are able to offer a "freestanding ENL class" to our Transitional level 10  th and 11th  graders  because of this scheduling. These students attend a co-taught ELA class and three 75-minute blocks of ELL support  during Design for Life class with the ENL staff. They receive credit for English language enrichment activities through  their Design for Life class. (This year we have an unusual number of Transitioning ELLs in 10th grade due to recent  immigration histories so we have increased minutes of instruction.)    11  th   graders are heterogeneously grouped into a co-taught ELA class and supported with pull-out/push-in in that  class as well as their Design for Life class, allowing for the full 180 minutes of Expanding level support. (All but one of  our 11  th   graders are Expanding this year.)    12  th   graders attend a separate ENL class three days a week in addition to their ELA class if below the Commanding  Level. This year all but one 12th grader scored Commanding on the 2017 NYSESLAT or passed the ELA Regents in the  same semester. Push-in and pull-out occurs in this ENL/ELA grouping because although the students are  Commanding, they are behind in their Global Regents exam pass rates, so they are integrated with lower grade  ELLs who are also receiving support on the same content.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     NA   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      NA   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Using both integrated ELA/ENL co-taught classes, stand alone ENL classes, Design for Life class and pull-out/push in support, all  students are afforded their instructional minutes and many receive more support through small group intervention with the  literacy coach, reading intervention teacher and student teachers. Entering students (we have none this year) receive 540  minutes of instruction, broken down into one unit of Stand-Alone ENL, one unit of Integrated ENL and one unit of Stand-Alone  or Integrated instruction.  Emerging students receive their 90 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL support through carefully scheduled  pull-out from Design for Life class and their remaining 270 minutes of instruction through Integrated, co-taught ELA class with  a pull-out rotation once a week. Transitioning students receive 180 minutes of instruction through co-taught Integrated ENL  class, with the possibility of pull-out rotation depending on skill level. Expanding students receive their one unit of study in  ENL/ELA class with pull-out from Design for Life class possible if intervention is needed. Commanding students receive their 90  minutes of instruction during Design for Life and coaching periods, where they can work on content from ELA or other areas.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   The curriculum for 9th grade ELL classes is the same as mainstream classes, however, the novels are offered in translated  versions or simplified texts.  Where translations are not available, graphic novel versions or low-level summaries are provided,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      often through google translate.  Students complete all the same Milestones as their mainstream peers, however, their mode  of response differs.  For instance, for beginning ELLs, event summary and character analysis is substituted for analytical  paragraphs.  Intermediate ELLs write analytical paragraphs with the support of quote banks, graphic organizers, books on tape,  film clips and sentence starters.  Advanced ELLs use targeted academic vocabulary, extra revision guides, online translations  and peer editing. All internal Milestones are now Common Core aligned.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   We use the Chinese Reading Test and Spanish Lab as interim assessments. The Spanish for Native Speakers program supports  Spanish speakers developmentally in their L1 skills.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    We have no SIFE students this year. If we do, they are usually scheduled into a small group rotation (stand-alone model) where  they can complete a skills system such as Just Words, MySciLearn (a computer program) or Wilson Reading  Program. Newcomers are assigned a faculty point person and mentor as academic coach. They are put in the ELL cohort in  their grade and given extra time in a separate section if necessary. Additionally, newcomers receive extra minutes through  pull-out from Design for Life class. Developing students are scheduled heterogeneously into all classes but first priority is given  to their schedules so that optimal co-teacher and ELL support is available. For instance, science classes with ELLs and special ed  students are arranged first to coordinate service providers and allow for mirrored content when available. Long-term ELLs  receive both ELL intervention and reading support with the literacy coach. They have "Personal Education Plans" which reflect  differentiated instruction and materials needed and which are shared with all their teachers.Former ELLs meet in small pull- out groups scheduled in AM Forum advisory and Design for Life class.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL-SWDs are taught with attention to multiple intelligences and processing ability.  If there is an overlap of language and  processing issues, individual educational plans are used to differentiate instruction, at times employing station work, extension  activities, visual learning, different modes of response.  Testing modifications and learning modifications (use of computer to  record etc) are observed. Response to Intervention approach is used for SWD-ELLs as well as Just Words, an ELL-approved  program created by Wilson Reading. Readings for SWD-ELLs are assigned via lexile band and book clubs include native  language literature.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our self-contained students attend both 12-1 classes and integrated advisory class, Design for Life, art and gym. Design For Life  and Skills Section classes are flexibly grouped and scheduled.  Changes are made throughout the year to best accommodate  students and reflect declassification when appropriate. Students with Integrated Co-teaching mandated in their IEPs are  placed in the least restrictive environment with maximum support. If they have SETSS support mandated, they receive both  ELL support and SETSS support. Changes to IEPs are made during the IEP meeting and triennial meetings, always with the aim  of placing students in the least restrictive setting.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  We have a block "ELL cohort" class for 9th grade, where all incoming ELLs are placed in a middle-level ELA class along with  English-dominant peers. This class meets for double blocks (540 minutes), allowing for extra ELA and ENL time which is used  for small group intervention, integrating ELLs with higher and lower performing peers in both the large class setting and small   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      group rotations. The methodology is based on Response to Intervention. The class is co-taught by an ENL teacher and an ELA  teacher, with a regular schedule of small group rotation. In tenth grade, we offer support in ELA class through integrated co- teaching models (with sheltered instruction SIOP methodologies). In 10  th   grade we also pull-out from Design for Life class to  provide extra support on ELA classwork outside of the content class as well as social studies and science. This helps us support  former ELLs in their content classes without removing them from class and satisfies the 90 minute requirement for our many  Emerging 10th   grade ELLs. In 11th grade, students are heterogeneously grouped and support is provided through co-teaching  and pull-out.  Seniors receive support in co-taught ELA class as well as intervention during Design for Life class. Commanding  students who tested out of services two years ago are supported during their Design for Life class which offers an opportunity  for review, test prep and college admissions counseling without taking students from their mainstream classes. Our academic  coaching program makes sure that Commanding ELLs have a consistent academic mentor and faculty contact throughout all  four years of their studies. This year we are paying special attention to the Native Language Arts Curriculum distributed by the  OELL in English Department meetings, working out ways to implement support for students via the Common Core standards  and Native Language skill development. AMAO data shows that students who entered the country before their sixth grade  year do much better with grade-level requirements because they have a stronger basis in the target language. Students who  immigrated after seventh grade therefor are given opportunities for smaller sections and review sections to supplement basic  language skills and social studies skills. This year we opened up an integrated Global Studies review section including ELL  students in 11th   and 12th   grade.  Our Spanish for Native Speakers program successfully supports Spanish speakers in their  L1 as the teacher is trained in RTI.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Next year we will expand Student Led Conferences to all grades. This conference is an opportunity to students to coordinate  and present a snapshot of their learning to a faculty panel and provides added oral modality practice for ELLs. Also, Kinsella's  Vocabulary Toolkit program with be expanded to the 9th and 10th grades and delivered through the Design for Life Program.  Words learned are captured in student-directed videos and sent out to parents and students via email for practice and  repetition. Co-teaching will be expanded for 11  th   grade English classes because we have a larger cohort of ELLs who are  rising Juniors. This also increases our integrated model offerings as per CR Part 154.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   One section of Design for Life will be discontinued so that the ELL staff is free to support former ELLs in math and science.  Former ELLs now require ENL support for 90 minutes so ELL staff is needed to coordinate support in different content areas.  Additionally, an internal needs assessment found that the Science Department was under-supported in ENL strategies and  Special Education strategies, so ELL staff will integrate with math classes and join the math department's faculty meetings and  department no-teaching days.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our "Office Hours" model has been very successful.  Every teacher has two after-school days available from 3-4:00 for small  group study and one-on-one review.  Students are invited to Office Hours with "Blue Slips" that describe the need for extra  support or intervention. Extra credit is given in some classes for attendance. Many ELLs elect to come regularly for extra help  outside school. We offer after-school programs in music, dance, cooking and photography. We have partnered with Urban Arts  and have successfully placed several ELLs in after school programs that enrich their English through group activities. Right now,  opportunities for Chinese and Spanish bilingual programs exist with Urban Arts and we are applying for grants to expand the  program offerings to support other languages. Additionally, students may attend Saturday school offerings before SAT exams  and Regents examinations. These extra prep classes are taught by NDHS co-teaching staff so they teachers are familiar with  ENL methodologies and strategies.  This year we have two senior ELLs and six former-ELLs enrolled in 12th grade AP English.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.

New Visions provides support with vocabulary blogs and ilearn. Urban Arts provides support for video and  music projects.          13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Our school's ENL program is supported by the Native Language resources of our Joan Anne Chovnik , who works with students  tin reading conferences to find appropriately-leveled native language readings.  If no resources exist, as was the case for a new  Korean student, she purchases appropriate materials, such as our new set of 9  thgrade novels in Korean translation: Of Mice  and Men, The Absolutely True Diary of Part Time Indian and others. Our science department, history department and English  department use memrise.com for vocabulary capture and review, lingro.com for translation and rewordify.com for modifying  texts--all of which have bilingual translation capabilities within the programs. The librarian obtains translated versions of all  standard novels through the OWL or CATS databases and suppliers like China Sprout. Googledocs is our school-wide system  and teacher dashboard is used in conjunction with student work on googledocs, allowing for easy translation into Spanish,  Chinese, French and Russian. Vocabulary blogs give students an option to capture simple definitions through Simple Wikipedia  automatically, record them online and share them with classmates.  Urban Arts provides support for video and music projects  which support L1 reinforcement for Spanish-speaking ELLs. Students with computer access at home use MySciLearn, a leveled,  self-assessing software program with audio. Students who do not have computer access progress through the English Yes!  program and the True Stories curriculum. The Spanish for Native Speakers program supports Spanish speakers in their L1.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    We now have Design For Life class for all 9th,   10 th  , 11th   and 12th   graders.  One section of each is devoted to an ELL  cohort, allowing for grade-appropriate support and academic intervention in math, social science and science.  We also have  small group intervention through the Expanded Success Initiative and Sisterhood foundations.  Our school-wide coaching  program assigns a caseload of four students to each teacher for one-on-one weekly academic and character-development  support.  NYU tutors and interns supplement our small staff and reinforce content in small groups.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our science department, history department and English department use memrise.com for vocabulary capture and review,  lingro.com for translation and rewordify.com for modifying texts.  The librarian obtains translated versions of all standard  novels.  Googledocs is our school-wide system and teacher dashboard is used in conjunction with student work on  googledocs.  New Visions has created several programs for our internal processes,  including the Student Portfolio site, the  Design For Life site.  New Visions provides support with vocabulary blogs.  Urban Arts provides support for video and music  projects.          16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   New ELLs attend orientation in the spring the year before entry and then again the week before school.  Michael Cassiano,  Director of Student Success, Danilo Martinez, Assistant Principal and Darren Chase, ELL Teacher all participate. Newly enrolled  ELLs have access to manga versions of class novels, online summaries and native language translations.  They are carefully  scheduled into advisory periods (AM Forum) so they have a supportive atmosphere which lowers their affective filters, better  enabling language acquisition.  Whenever possible, coaching is available in their native language. Spanish is available on-site  and Chinese counseling has been arranged in the past.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    ELLs can elect to take Spanish.  Because they require ELL classes in their schedules, they take foreign language later in their  school careers, in eleventh or twelfth grade.  Some students who need extra support during school hours in English do not take  Spanish courses and receive credit for their native language studies in the home country.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48   In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?         NA     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Darren Chase leads professional development for ELL staff at the school and recommends workshops for teachers, both ELL  certified and content subject certified. Math and Science teachers attended the STEM/ELL conference and will attend  Krashen's Language Acquisition Workshop. All teachers receive the full 15% of their CR Part 80 mandated professional  development through our weekly after-school workshops which take place Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 3:20- 4:20.  Every teacher rotates through a quarter-long ELL seminar as well as the payroll secretary and assistant principals. This  year we are beginning to turnkey the SNLACG standards in an "ELL and the Common Core" workshop. Additionally, every  department has one non-teaching day a month, on a Monday or Friday, during which faculty members meet to align curricula.  The ELL staff meets with the English department to align Native Language skills and Common Core Standards as well as SINLA  strategies to support the needs of SIFE students. The science department has been very involved with turnkeying new  technologies for ELLs they learned at the UFT STEM conference such as google doc translate, google speak and rewordify. All  Living Environment content and Earth Science classes are now translated into Spanish and Chinese.   Darren Chase attends professional development. He attended the CR Part 154 workshop as well as Dr. Kinsella's Academic  Toolkit PD, the Literacy Institute sponsored by the ELL Think Tank at NYU and the Wilson Steps 5-10 Training through New  Visions during the summer. Teachers meet once a week in "learning pods." Every teacher must spend time in an ELL strategies  pod. We are implementing the SNLACG standards in an "ELL and the Common Core" workshop via the resources provided by  the OELL in regards to Native Language skills and Common Core standards.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our sister school, New Design Middle School assists with transitioning from middle school. The school guidance counselor is  supported by the Design for Life teacher, a certified in ESL and English, who creates individualized plans for ELLs regarding  credit accumulation and scheduling. Attendance in ELL "learning pods" and outside PD is recorded in google docs. Each internal  professional development pod lasts for one quarter, so it is well over the 15% total hours for all teachers. Agendas and  attendance are stored on a google drive. The ENL teachers spend their monthly professional development day (a non-teaching  gym day) in literacy enrichment and meeting in grade-level teams and content area teams.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Outside of normal Parent Teacher Conferences and our three Orientation Days, and our quarterly Coaching Program Student- Led Conferences, we provide one additional meeting with students and their families during the first quarter. During this  meeting, the ELL teacher facilitates a discussion of the student's progress and challenges and reviews the student's ELL  services. The student's digital portfolio is discussed and digital copies of Milestone assessments in each core subject are   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49            reviewed. Additionally, progress to graduation and credits earned as well as Regents progress and NYSESLAT improvement are  discussed in the parents' preferred language.  Parents receive information about helping their students with translated novels,  vocabulary blogs and how to log into online at-home support like MySciLearn, memrise.com and Off2Class.com.  ELL parents  are contacted early so that Home Language Surveys, Parent Program Choice, and other ELL matters can be organized early in  the year, as per CR 154 regulations. Ongoing communication with parents is coordinated through the support department,  headed by Jordan Bancroft.  Paula Tran is responsible for arranging interpreted meetings and phone conversations with  parents. Darren Chase is responsible for all ongoing entitlement letters, placement letters and Re-identification and Non- entitlement letters if applicable and necessary.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Daniel Cabrera, the parent coordinator who meets with parents during PTA meetings and leads focus groups to get parental  recommendations about school improvement.  Ninth grade orientation occurs in June, over the summer and the week  immediately before the start of school. Coaching conferences supplement parent interaction beyond the normal Parent  Teacher Conference dates and PTA meetings, giving parents more scheduling flexibility. Every teacher must communicate by  phone to students on the "hot list" an attendance and academic intervention email system that distributes names and  numbers to teachers for easier outreach. The individual content teachers use Skedula's Translator to send progress reports  with comments. All report card and progress reports are translated from the STARS system and teachers of ELLs are supported  in learning how to translate their comments using online programs before pasting them into the reports.     Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Scott Conti, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   New Design High School                                                                              School DBN: 02M543  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We used initial home language forms and parent surveys, ATS Report of Preferred Language, the EDAT tool, Blue  Cards, student surveys and classroom/advisory teacher input to determine the parents' preferred language of  communication. Our academic coaching program creates a faculty point person for each student who is  responsible for getting to know that student's family. Our internal parent outreach software (Skedula and Kinvo)  makes sure parents are contacted and corresponded with in their preferred languages, even if it is contrary to  their original surveys or ATS reports. It also allows us to update changes. The LPT team meet to review our  procedures.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53   Language    Written  Preferred    Percent  Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    Spanish   Spanish    Spanish    NA    Chinese    Chinese    Chinese       Spanish   Chinese   French African   Haitian Creole    French   Ukrainian      Most parents prefer written  communications in Spanish and  simplified Chinese.

A Ukrainian  translator is used for verbal IEP meetings,  but written communication is in Russian.  More than five low-incidence West  African languages are represented in our  student body, but English and French are  used for verbal and written  communication.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu).

Incoming 9th graders meet with the  administration during the Spring  semester before their initial entry and  also during summer orientation.    During that time the ELL teacher  meets with parents to confirm  program choices and explain bilingual  options. .    All students participate in Student Led  Conferences for giving another  opportunity for parent involvement.  ELL students have early priority to  schedule their conferences so that we  can meet with parents before the  initial 10-day deadline and then again  before the 45-day deadline for  changes           3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.

The poster, parents Bill of Rights and Language Access Parents' Guide are all accessible to parents during Student Led  Conferences and student orientations. We have created a standard email that reflects the new ELL regulations in CR  Part 154 and are creating new systems and programs such as orientation, Student Led Conferences and PTA meetings  to more effectively reach all parents.         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We make sure both the Department of Education survey and our internal questionnaire are responded to by sending  emails through our automated computer systems (Skedula and Kinvo) and phone system. We also send information  home with students whenever possible through our AM Forum advisory program. Our coaching program is creating  bridges between the school and parents because a faculty point person is responsible for relaying communications  from content teachers, streamlining communication and ensuring that parents receive automated texts, robo-calls  and email updates in their own languages. Links to parent surveys are sent via email in the preferred language.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57
