This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of Primary School 69 is to provide rigorous instruction to improve student learning for academic, social  and emotional success for all aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Together, we create a welcoming  environment for all, including staff, students, and families. Our work is grounded in collaborative, trusting, respectful  relationships where all voices are valued and appreciated.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.S. 69 is proud to be named The Vincent D. Grippo School in honor of the late superintendent of Community District  20. The schools opened in September 2002 on the border of Sunset Park and Bay Ridge. In 2018-2019, our school  plans to continue to provide a safe, supportive and challenging environment and experiences which students can  succeed. Everyone in the school community aims to work toward a shared goal. With trust, this shared goal of student  achievement will be reached. The school is committed to provide students with an equitable and excellent education.   The Literacy program utilizes the Common Core leveled texts provided by ReadyGen with an implementation of  teacher-created lessons and unit planning crafted by grade level with Literacy Coach support. ENL, AIS RTI, SETSS  teachers, and a library teacher provide further support for teachers and students. Our mathematics program, Go  Math is implemented during a Math block and supported by a full-time Math Coach and three SETSS teachers. Our  Science program is aligned with the NGSS NYS Standards, the NYC K-5 Scope and Sequence, and the NYC STEM  Framework. Students enter a state-of-the-art Science Lab. The Science curriculum is supplemented by the Picture  Perfect Science/STEM, Harcourt Houghton Mifflin Science, National Geographic Exploring Science and "Engineering is  Elementary" programs in grades K through 5. Our Social Studies program follows NYS Standards and the NYC K-8  Scope and Sequence. It is supplemented by Unit Guides from the K-8 Passport to Social Studies curriculum and  Harcourt Houghton Mifflin textbooks.    The school has adopted an 7-day schedule to provide students with opportunities to participate in all non-content  area subjects. The Academic curriculum is supplemented by a strong fine arts program including Music, Band, Art  Studio, Chorus, and the Violin Program. Teachers are working to include more project-based activities with a focus on  small group instruction and higher order thinking skills. Students are equally engaged in team talk, accountable talk,  and grand conversations. Technology is an integral part of our instructional program. All classrooms, including the  Library, Science Lab, and Art Studio, are equipped with Smart Boards and every classroom has access to wireless  computer carts and iPads. A full-time Technology Teacher and a full-time Computer Technician provide ongoing  support of the program by facilitating workshops and maintaining hardware and software. The school is highlighting  efforts to integrate STEM+A (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and ARTS) into the school curriculum.    We have relationships with outstanding arts organizations to complete this dynamic framework. All Arts curriculum is  developed in alignment with the NYC DOE’s Blueprint for the Arts, the Common Core Standards and Danielson's  Framework for Teaching. Additionally, P.S. 69 is pioneering the development and use of formative assessments in the  visual arts. P.S. 69 has formed relationships with several outside agencies including Arts Connection, New York Public  Library, Dancing Classrooms, TADA! Youth Theater, Noel Pointer Foundation (Violin), and the Brooklyn Chinese  American Association, a local community-based organization to support the Arts curriculum.    At PS 69, the school has provided opportunities for students to grow intellectually, socially and emotionally. Social  Emotional Learning has been integrated into daily routines. Students and staff has embraced these experiences and  carry them within the school, as well as in their lives outside of school.   Since September 2015, P.S. 69 has been involved with The Leader in Me. The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People are  instilled in the staff, students, and families. These habits are seamlessly integrated into the school's daily routines and  curriculum. Professional development is ongoing.     Habit 1: Be Proactive    Habit 2: Begin with an End in Mind    Habit 3: Put First Things First    Habit 4: Think Win-Win    Habit 5: Seek first to understand, then to be understood    Habit 6: Synergize    Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Since Spring 2016, staff members, including teachers, paraprofessionals, and office staff, were trained in Mindful  Schools to add positive behavior supports in our school.    With this in mind, our vision is for students to become enthusiastic lifelong learners and productive citizens. P.S. 69  will provide a safe and fair environment in which the school staff, with the support of parents and community, guide  the children toward respecting others, understanding the varied cultures of our society, and striving for behavioral  and academic excellence. All students will be prepared for a rapidly changing world and be able to access information,  solve problems, think critically, make decisions and work productively with others. Ongoing communication and  collaboration among classroom teachers, support staff, administration, and parents will be present to produce an  integrated program for all students. Each experience helps to build a student’s ability to read, write, listen and speak,  which helps them to be successful in all areas. This year we will continue to focus on providing our students and  families with programs that highlight visual, musical and theatrical arts.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   P.S.69 aims to provide rigorous and differentiated instruction to ensure all students, including ELLs and Students with  Disabilities, make significant gains in literacy and math. The instructional program is based upon achieving Common  Core State Standards in student grade level performance and progress. We continue to implement a Balanced Literacy  Program throughout the grades during a blocked literacy period, which includes reading and writing workshop, as well  as word study.   P.S. 69 has a current enrollment of 785 students in grades Kindergarten through 5 with 9% of the population being  Students with Disabilities. The majority of our student population reflects the growing Chinese-American immigrant  community with over 52% ELL population.    Our school is comprised of six (6) Kindergarten classes, five (5) first grades, Four (4) second grades, four (4) third  grades, five (5) fourth grades, five (5) fifth grades and two (2) self-contained Special Education Bridge Classes. The  average class size in Kindergarten is twenty-five (25) and Grades 1-5 is thirty-two (32). Since 2005, overflow of zoned  Kindergarten students has attended Kindergarten at other District 20 elementary school with a right to return to P.S.  69 in first grade. In Spring 2018, over 600 families applied for Kindergarten at P.S. 69; this far exceeds the capacity to  which the school can accommodate. In order to support the ELL population, Chinese bilingual classes are offered in  kindergarten, first grade, and second grade. In response to the CR Part 154 and the academic demands of our  students, self-contained ENL classes are in Kindergarten and First Grade. Letters, notices and report cards are  provided with the Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, and Urdu translation.   Our school's needs is to move students, including ELLs and SWDs, to Levels 3 and 4 of proficiency on the NYS ELA and  Math Assessments, as well as to support students to advance in NYSESLAT levels towards English Language  Proficiency. After analyzing the EDAT, the school was able to identify and support the students who were struggling  with the modalities of Writing and Speaking.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   From September 2014 to June 2018, P.S. 69 was recognized as a Showcase School for providing a deep and  challenging curriculum in visual arts, music, dance, and theater, provided by a collaborative team of skilled  professionals. Visual arts and music teachers led the way, along with contributions from all teachers, to integrate the  arts across the curriculum. During the Showcase visits, educators learned how to naturally infuse arts into the literacy  curriculum, see systems and structures that bring arts programming to all students and understand how to use the  arts to bolster early language acquisition.   Strong key areas of focus include:     providing rigorous instruction aligned with the Common Core State Standards in literacy and math, as well as   other content areas;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11                  increasing student’s language acquisition through purposeful arts experiences that engage students in  reading, writing, listening and speaking;  cultivating a culture where teachers collaborate and develop interdisciplinary curriculum with an integration  of the arts and technology;     building stronger family-community ties through conversations and workshops during parent engagement   times         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 20K069   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   785   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

With each unit additional professional  development is scheduled with the Literacy Coach to help  teachers plan for lessons aligned with Common Core Learning  Standards (based on the ReadyGen anchor texts), differentiate  instruction, score and analyze assessments, and determine next  steps. Teachers determine the instructional needs of their  students through the analysis of the performance tasks, the end  of unit assessment, and informal observations. During grade  meetings and professional development sessions they also use  their knowledge of this analysis to formulate strategy groups.  Throughout the school year, professional development in  mathematics is offered to the classroom teachers and support  staff, with a focus on differentiated instruction, Common Core  Learning Standards, and the implementation of the GO Math!  program. The Math Coach meets with grade level teachers and  support staff for planning.      Workshops include   - Advanced Literacy- work to improve speaking   - Speech Teacher Staff PD   - ELL instruction presented by Lucia Medina-Perez, Borough Field  Support Center      At the initial planning conference, each teacher meets with  administrators to plan his/her professional goals for the 2018- 2019 school year.

While there is no Pre-Kindergarten program at the school, prospective families receive a packet over the summer to  prepare for Kindergarten. Upon request, parents can also tour the school. There is a Parent Orientation meeting in  September. Parents are invited to meet with the teachers to learn about school/classroom routines and the  curriculum. The Parent Coordinator and PTA host a welcome meeting and workshops. Monthly letters from the  principal and calendars are translated and sent home to facilitate communication and make families feel more  welcome. The SBST and IEP teacher reach out to families to continue Early Intervention services for students with IEP.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teachers meet as teams to plan for and reflect upon each unit assessment and performance task in reading, writing  and mathematics. Results of the assessments are used to drive instruction for whole group, small group and at-risk  services, as needed.   Members of the MOSL (Measures of Student Learning) team, which includes the UFT Chapter Leader, Principal, and  several teachers, meet in June to review and select the State and Local assessments and measures to use for teacher  evaluation. The MOSL selections will be presented during the September faculty meeting.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 69, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.S. 69 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand; and     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community.      Parental Involvement and School Quality   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and, evaluation of the effectiveness of the  school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the  implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

We are targeting grades 2-5 emerging,  transitioning and expanding ELLs to support language development in the 4 modalities of  listening, reading, speaking and writing.  Based on both the NYSESLAT and Fountas and  Pinnell assessments, emerging, transitioning and expanding students have been chosen for this  program.  The rationale for the program is linked to content areas of academic English for ELLs  needing further instruction in reading and writing. This program will provide additional direct  instruction to improve academic achievement in content subject areas.  Pending funding, entering  students may be invited to participate in a newcomer program for literacy and oral language  instruction.The subgroups and grade levels of students in grades 2-5 to be served are  approximately 22 emerging students, 45 transitioning and 112 expanding level.  Pending  funding, 20 entering students.The schedule and duration of the program will begin approximately  1/04/19 to 4/26/19. It includes 12 sessions at 2.5 hours each on Fridays.  The quantitative data analysis includes ATS reports  RLAT, and RESI .   ELL students data are  then merged to create the EDAT ( ELL Data Analysis Tool) which helps us to analyze students  growth, needs, and trends according to exam and attendance histories.  Qualitative data  analysis includes teacher observations and recommendations of students for the ELL  program.  The 2.5 hour Friday program will be organized accordingly.  There will be  approximately 15 classes for grades 2-5.  For students, the 4 strands of listening, speaking,  reading and writing will incorporate content-area topics. The topics included in each strand will  be in four content areas (conversational language, academic language arts, academic science, and  academic social studies) across listening, reading, writing, and speaking strands. This thematic  approach to language learning will be incorporated into NYSESLAT practice.  This focused  program is organized around the Common Core state standards.  Reading comprehension skills  are reinforced for literary and informational texts, complex texts, fluency, academic language,  and writing. Additional scaffolding materials will include but not limited  to ESL BrainPOP, Merriman-Webster online dictionaries, and NYSESLAT test prep materials  by Attanasio & Associates.  The following is a sample session for the emerging, transitioning  and expanding students in grade 2. 2:30-3:10    Listening / Speaking, Academic Science;  Animals are Unique3:15-3:55     Reading/ Academic Science, Amphibians4:00-4:40  Writing/  Academic Science,  How do amphibians stay safe?4:40-5:00  ESL Brainpop/ Camouflage with  interactive assessmentThe language of instruction will be in English, however home language  support will be provided to students with the use of bilingual dictionaries, Cambridge Dictionary  (dictionary.cambridge.org), and translate.google.com.   The materials used for the Title III Friday program will be purchased with Title III funds.  The  types of materials to be used will reflect the 4 key principles of language acquisition, listening,  speaking, reading and writing.  Emerging, transitioning, and expanding students will be using  Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT.  These lessons are based on thematic units that are content- based with greater use of academic language.  ELL students are then able to practice the skills of  listening, reading, speaking and writing for English fluency.  The lessons are scaffolded in order  for students to gradually increase their understanding of the content vocabulary.  Pending  funding, entering and emerging students from grades 2-5 will be using How to Teach Spelling   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   which is a phonics based program based on the Orton-Gillingham approach to reading and  spelling. Supplemental reading materials may include On Our Way to English by  Rigby and Treasure Chest by Macmillan/McGraw-Hill. These interactive kits have multiple  activities for the beginning stages of English language acquisition.   This includes practice with  fluency and sentence structure as well as word choice and academic language. It is designed  specifically to give students practice in oral language development and comprehensive literacy  instruction.   There will be approximately 15 ESL/Bilingual teachers.  The on-site supervisor will be paid  from the Title III funding.  The supervisor will oversee students arrival, dismissal and the  method of delivery of instruction.  Teachers will take attendance at the beginning of each session  and send down the attendance to the main office.  Since this is the only Friday program at PS  69K, the supervisor will ensure safety by overseeing attendance, student arrival, and  dismissal.  The supervisor will also serve as the instructional leader in supporting teachers as  they implement the program.  Parents will receive all translated notifications related to the Title III program in their preferred  languages.  All notifications pertaining to this program will be sent out in English and preferred  languages to meet the communities needs.

Additional PD topics may include, Teaching in Themes, Scaffolding  Content Vocabulary in Social Studies and Science, Incorporating Listening and Speaking  Activities for ELLs, and Incorporating Reading and Writing Activities for ELLs.  Highly  qualified and  experienced ESL and Bilingual  teachers  that are NYS certified  will provide the  training for these sessions.  These PD sessions are at cost to the Title III program.  These PDs  will positively impact the performance of the teacher and teaching of ELL students in the  following ways:  teachers will share best practices to reflect further on effective strategies for  language acquisition,  teachers will discuss and evaluate learners progress to streamline  instructional practices for optimal learning.  All records  for professional development will be  maintained with attendance sheets, and agendas.   In addition to the Title III program, professional development is ongoing and well planned  throughout the year during the regular school day.  Three sessions monthly are conducted by the  literacy and math coaches to collaborate with the classroom, ESL, and Special Education  teachers. Additionally, extensive professional development sessions are organized by each grade  to plan and develop curriculum before each new unit of study.

The parent engagement activities throughout the school year are designed to  inform and assist parents to be involved in their children's education and school life.  Teachers  invite families into their classroom for publishing parties on a monthly basis providing authentic  experiences for celebration and learning. Family fun night is also a monthly event organized by  the PTA/Parent coordinator to engage parents for community and school activities. Events  include and are not limited to movie nights, multicultural dances and performances, holiday  celebrations, and art /literacy workshops.  Translators are available and parents are informed of  all meetings and workshops in their preferred language. Workshops for parent engagement are  conducted by administrators, coaches, the parent coordinator, and ESL/Bilingual  teachers.  ELL  parents are notified of all activities through a monthly calendar of school events,  the PS 69K school website, and a monthly parent bulletin board. The Office of Adult and  Continuing Education offers an ESL class three evenings a week at PS69K for parents to learn  English and support their children in school.  A new initiative by the NYCDOE requires weekly  parent sessions after-school which are conducted by teachers for parent outreach and  engagement.  Parents of ELLs are also on the School Leadership Team to participate in school  wide decision making. The parent coordinator invites parents to monthly workshops that include  a range of topics.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The assessment tool we use for our ELL learners at PS69 is Fountas and Pinnell. There are different components, such as word  identification, letter and sound correspondences, and comprehension checks.  Reading behaviors are noticed and recorded  individually.   Benchmark independent levels as well as benchmark instructional levels are evaluated and assessed.  The  insights of this data provides diagnoses of  ELL subgroups and their reading behavior needs.  For example,  Newcomer ELLs  may need to  focus on decoding and phonological awareness as well as syntax and visual cues to further comprehension.  For  Developing ELLs emphasis may be on expressive language to reflect deeper understanding of texts read.  Fountas and Pinnell  assessments help the schools instructional plan to target ELL learners reading strengths and weaknesses to differentiate  instructional practices in the classroom. Guided Reading Groups, as well as Strategy groups, are formed based on the insights  of this data.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Weekly grade meetings with literacy and math coaches are in place to support the efforts for the planning of ELLs.  Additionally, there are monthly double planning professional development periods in literacy for each grade level. These  planning periods include emphasis on all ELLs and their subgroups.  Reading and writing lessons are planned to include high  order questioning strategies.  Emphasis may include ELL  and special ed modifications to scaffold instructional  practices.  Language standards are incorporated to adjust our instructional goals accordingly. Strengths and weakness of  students may be discussed for further implementation of language acquisition goals.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The summative assessments used to identify baseline/ benchmark, progress and areas of needs are the NYC Performance  Tasks.  Baseline assessments are administered at the beginning of the year to understand students skill levels.  Assessments  are administered and analyzed to direct instruction for areas of need. This is an ongoing process where teachers assess,  evaluate, discuss and plan.  Student outcomes are analyzed to indicate progress or lack of.  In addition, there are teacher- made skills-based tests to assess reading and vocabulary to formulate strategy and guided reading groups for all ELL  subgroups.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered it is used to identify interventions on a needs basis.  We review and assess for  evidence of growth and gaps across grade levels and content areas. We create sub-groups of students for instructional  purposes to target skills and strategies.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school uses various assessment as a guide for instruction for ELLs within the RTI framework.  Students are provided with  increasingly intensive intervention instruction targeted to match their learning needs as demonstrated by performance on  periodically administered assessments.  The universal screening for students participating in RTI  is used as a baseline  according to the following:  All of these multiple sources of assessments guide strong core instruction and planning by the Academic Intervention Services.  Progress monitoring informs how at-risk students are responding to this instruction.  All students, including ELLs who received  a Level 1 on the NYS ELA or Math, will receive a minimum of eight weeks of intensive targeted intervention.  Instruction will be  based on each child's area of need.  Strong core instruction includes guided reading, using leveled readers, skill/strategy  groups to develop comprehension and NYReady to support children in test-taking strategies. After eight weeks, children are  reassessed to determine the continuation of at-risk SETSS services or referral for special education services.        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We inform our ELL program and evaluate our assessment outcomes, using the NYSESLAT, NYS ELA, and Math state tests. We  also look at the ELL Data Analysis Tool to help us design instructional and intervention programs for specific sub-groups of  ELLs.    The data patterns reveal that ELLs taking the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT are making great gains throughout each proficiency level.  There are increases from Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding levels.  173 of ELLs who took the NYSITELL and  NYSESLAT exams were in the commanding level. 173 were expanding level, 85 were transitioning, 51 were emerging and  90 were entering. The NYSITELL data informs us that ELLs entering our school are mostly on entering levels.  The NYSESLAT  data informs us that our students are making annual increases in both progress and proficiency according to the ELL Data  Analysis tool.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   After we analyze the data to disseminate these findings, we are able to have an increased focus on ELL subgroups according to  their strengths and weaknesses.  This information includes ELA and Math scores to help us further align our groups.  These   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         findings allow us to make adjustments and program our ENL instructional components to meet the academic needs of our  ELLs .         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The freestanding English as a New Language (ENL) program at PS 69 provides instruction in English with home  language support and emphasizing English language acquisition. The instruction is to develop English language skills  so that students can succeed in core content courses.  It is delivered by a certified ENL teacher. These stand-alone  students are grouped by ENL levels of Entering and Emerging.  The integrated ENL instruction focuses on English  language skills through content area instruction. It is delivered by a certified ENL teacher co-teaching with a content  area teacher.  Both integrated and stand-alone ENL instruction include content area subject matter using ENL  strategies.  All ELLs and former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status must receive a minimum number of units  of integrated ENL.    ENL instruction is delivered through a predominantly push-in collaborative model with some pull out for entering,  emerging and transitioning students.   The pull-out model is mostly focused on phonics instruction and word study for  the entering and emerging level ELLs.  The push-in model focuses on content area vocabulary and  comprehension.  There are 2 self-contained ENL kindergarten classes and 1 self-contained ENL first grade class. There  are 4 Chinese bilingual classes in Kindergarten, First, Second, and Third grades; one on each grade level, respectively.    The program model for our ENL program is programmed to satisfy the Commissioner's Regulations for Part CR-154.  Each class is heterogeneously grouped by grade. ENL instruction is homogeneously grouped.  In the push-in model,  ENL teachers are scheduled to be with their ELLs during the literacy block as much as possible.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Transitional bilingual education (TBE) programs are designed so that students develop conceptual skills in their home  language as they learn English.  All instruction is Common Core-aligned to accelerate student achievement. TBE  programs are predicated on transferring literacy from a student's home language to a student's new language  (English). Students acquire literacy most effectively in the language most familiar to them.  Skills used in home  language acquisition (eg. making sense of print, using writing to communicate, playing with language structure,  developing vocabulary) are skills that a student can use for faster and more successful acquisition of English literacy.    In TBE programs, students transfer home language skills to English by spending instructional time primarily in the  home language before steadily transitioning to English. At the beginning/entering level, TBE students are expected to  receive 75% of instruction in their home language and 25% in English. As a student’s English proficiency increases,  more of his or her instructional day is spent learning in English. In TBE programs, teachers must make several  considerations when determining which language is best to teach certain concepts. Teachers must consider carefully  the intellectual demand of concepts, student familiarity with concepts in the home language and English, and the  academic language required for using and mastering concepts.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   The mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in our TBE and ENL program.  We  identify all ELLs according to their proficiency levels of entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding and commanding and the  teachers are programmed accordingly.  For our ENL program, entering and emerging level students are programmed for 360  minutes; transitioning and expanding students are programmed for 180 minutes; and commanding students are programmed  for 90 minutes. ENL instructional time for the TBE program is delivered within the Literacy block which is 2 periods a day.      Bilingual instruction for grades K, 1 and 2 are provided according to the following program model. Students in the beginning  stages receive native language instruction and English instruction using a 60/40 ratio of Chinese and English respectively.  Students in the intermediate stages receive native language instruction using a 50/50 ratio of Chinese and English.  Students in  the advanced stages receive native language instruction using a 25/75 ratio of Chinese and English. Native Language  instruction is delivered in blocks of 50 minute periods daily according to the Language Allocation Policy Guidelines for  Transitional Bilingual Programs. As the year progresses, the teacher shifts increasingly towards English instruction in line with  the students' emerging language proficiency. ESL instructional time for the TBE program is delivered within the literacy block, 2  periods a day.     In line with the Commissioner's Regulations, Part 154, all of the Bilingual teachers differentiate instruction according to  students language levels. The bilingual classes extend the literacy block, when needed, in order to accommodate the varied  needs of the bilingual learner.    The following is a 7 period day schedule for a Chinese TBE class.   One 50 minute Writing Workshop (ENL)  One 50 minute Reading Workshop (ENL)  One 50 minute Math Workshop (Chinese/English)  One 50 minute Content Area- Science, Social Studies (Chinese)  One 50 minute Native Language Arts (Chinese)      The ENL program further differentiates levels of instruction by providing 360 minutes for entering and emerging students.  Transitioning and expanding students receive 180 minutes of instruction. Commanding student receive 90 minutes of  instruction.  The following is a schedule for a 7-period push-in ENL class.  One 50 minute push-in ENL/Word Study  One 50 minute push-in ENL/Reading Workshop  One 50 minute push-in ENL/Writing Workshop  One 50 minute push-in ENL/Math  One 50 minute push-in ENL/Social Studies     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Core content is delivered in the Chinese Bilingual and ENL program to integrate academic and English language instruction for  success in the content subject areas.  The instructional approaches and methods used to make content comprehensible to  foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core Leaning Standards are based on the Sheltered  Instruction Observation Protocol Model (SIOP).  This SIOP model makes academic instruction comprehensible by providing  extra context support to the learner to enrich language development.  We align this instructional model with the ReadyGen  adapted curriculum to differentiate instruction for ELLs to make content comprehensible. The key components of SIOP are the  following: highlighting key concepts or vocabulary, using visuals and graphic organizers, modifying speech, modeling structure,  and practicing skills within structured activities. These are scaffolding techniques that build language skills and content  vocabulary.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   In the bilingual classes, teachers organize portfolio assessments for their students.  This includes a benchmark to assess  reading comprehension, keywords in vocabulary development and writing a short paragraph. This is done after each unit to  assess students Chinese development in literacy.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    For the Newcomer subgroup, teachers differentiate by using visual aids, graphic organizers, sentence stems and TPR Total  Physical Response for comprehensible input. Phonics and word study using the Orton-Gillingham methodology as well as  Dolch sight word lists are taught to develop primary literacy skills.    For the Developing subgroup, teachers continue to use linguistic scaffolds such as visual aids, graphic organizers, and sentence  stems for goals related to classroom activities. Bloom's taxonomy and levels of questioning are modeled and practiced by both  teachers and students.  Teachers plan for interactive language practice such as turn and talk, small group discussions and  presentations to extend learning in English.     For Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status, teachers continue to give linguistic support in the academic language  of content instruction.  Teachers emphasize higher order questioning strategies to encourage discussions, conversations and  writing for academic and creative purposes.      All subgroups ( Newcomer, Developing, Long Term and Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status)  are engaged in  activities where there are multiple entry points for differentiated instruction. Teachers plan lessons that incorporate visual  aids, vocabulary study, and questioning techniques that are important for language learning and practice.  Students are  engaged in project-based activities with emphasis on the language acquisition skills of reading, writing, listening and speaking,  within small group work and collaborative study.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELLs and Students with Disabilities provide access to academic content using specific instructional strategies and  grade level materials. There are four special education teachers that provide this additional support to at-risk students,  ELL  students and bilingual students with special needs.  There are two self-contained special education classes with ENL students  that also receive this support.  The special education teacher aligns instruction with the classroom teacher providing support  to the students.  One strategy is to modify the content materials used in the subject area being taught. Another strategy is to  scaffold materials learned by using graphic organizers, and pre-teaching vocabulary for conceptual knowledge in learning new  information. The special education teachers use additional instructional materials to accelerate English language development:  Explode the Code by School Specialty, SRA by Mcgraw-Hill, Wilson and Wilson Fundations by Wilson Language Training, and i- Ready, by Curriculum Associated which is a web-based program used as a diagnostic for instruction. Explode the code and  Wilson Fundations (a language training program)  is aligned with the Orton-Gillingham method to accelerate phonemic  awareness and strategy for ELL-SWDs.  SRA by Mcgraw-Hill develops comprehension, vocabulary, fluency, word analysis, and  study skills.  It reinforces specific skills based on students weaknesses.  It engages student's interest and knowledge base using  both fiction and non-fiction text.  It promotes individualized and independent student work.  i-Ready provides rigorous on- grade level instruction and practice to meet individual or small group needs.  It is personalized student instruction based on  student needs and ongoing progress monitoring for teachers.      Home language materials used for students of ELL-SWDs include NYS word-to-word content area dictionaries to align to  content area subjects such as science, math, and social studies and bilingual libraries both non-fiction and fiction.  An   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      instructional strategy used for home language instruction is "Preview, View and Review "  In this strategy the teacher first  provides students with a quick introduction to the lesson in the native language; then the lesson is given in English; and finally,  a short summary is provided in Chinese. Another strategy to develop academic language is to provide multiple points of entry  for their students according to their English proficiency level. For example, all students will be working within the same content  area but the teacher will be able to create different supports to their students to access the content and academic language.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  All ELL-SWDs achieve their IEP goals by using flexible scheduling for a least restrictive environment. Flexible scheduling is  implemented for both general education students as well as for ELL students in a 12-1-1 model.  Using the least restrictive  environment, the ELL students that are approaching standards in the 12-1-1 class are mainstreamed into general education  content area classes.  For the general education ELLs with an IEP, the reverse programming is implemented.  Students who are  struggling in a subject area will be given several periods a day in a 12-1-1 class.  This flexibility in scheduling in a least restrictive  environment will help ELL- SWDs in general education and special education class attain English proficiency. For instructional  flexibility, there is tiered support system of RtI in place and in addition, targeted scaffolding support in the mainstream  classroom or resource room. To support meeting their standards-based IEP goals, meaningful and regular consultation,  planning, support, and coordination are all within the meeting times of special education teachers and related service  providers.  All special education teacher and support personnel for ELL-SWDs are included in curriculum planning meetings.  Flexible grouping is a key component for group formation to match learning tasks based on the curriculum and learner's  strengths, needs, and interest.            8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA and Math consists of Academic Intervention Services (AIS) that target  Newcomer ELLs and Developing ELLs.  These  ELL subgroups of students who have not made progress across performance level  on the NYSESLAT and who scored a level 1 in the New York State Math test and English Language Arts test are  provided with  RTI tiered support.  Students that are in targeted intervention programs are discussed in monthly Pupil  Personnel Team and School Implementation Team meetings for regular consultation, planning, support, and coordination of all  services and instruction.      Students in targeted intervention programs are grouped according to needs and abilities for specific scaffolded support in all  the core content areas such as math. social studies, science, and literacy.  These students are also included in our after-school  programs for extra tutoring when such program is in session. The following data is used to identify students that require  targeted intervention programs for instructional support; NYSESLAT scores, Fountas and Pinnell reading levels, ELA and  Mathematics score, and Informal teacher observations.  NYSESLAT scores identify at risk ELLs that have not made progress in  learning English.  Fountas and Pinnell identify at risk ELLs that have not made progress in reading.  ELA and Mathematics  results inform us of ELLs that fail to meet standards.  Informal teacher observations help us take a closer look at daily students  performance and interactions.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We will continue to consider further aligning both ReadyGen and GoMath curricula for the upcoming school year with a  language focus for our ELL learners.  We will also implement an online supplemental reading program called myON to  encourage independent reading for our students outside of the classroom. The myON reading program will be able to track  student progress with diagnostic assessments to view for both students and teachers. A new science program from National  Geographic Learning, Exploring Science and Amplify Science will be implemented and be aligned with the Next Generation  Science Standards (NGSS).  This science program has a focus on literacy with leveled independent books which are  differentiated with high, medium and low lexile readers.  There is also a specific ELL support reading connection to further  differentiate the linguistic needs for beginner, intermediate, and advanced ELL learners.     We will continue to focus on literacy and language skills based on our findings from the data and trends from PS 69K.  The  ELL  Data Analysis Tool has shown us that we are meeting our annual increases in the percentage of LEP/ELLs making progress in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      learning English, annual increases in the percentage of LEP/ELLs attaining proficiency and also Adequate Yearly Progress for  LEP/ELL subgroups in meeting grade -level academic achievement standards in ELA and Math.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.  During the day, they participate in the subject areas of art, music,  technology, and physical education.  A special student council is organized for students to participate in fundraisers, school  spirit, and community activism.  They are exposed to the democratic process of an election by campaigning and are required to  make a public speech.  Students vote for the candidate they believe represents them.  The Title III after-school instructional  program assists students in developing literacy, content area, and mathematics skills, supplemented by instructional materials  for NYSESLAT.  ELL students participate and have equal access to the same activities that the monolinguals are offered. Our  school invites ELLs to participate in all school-wide social and academic activities,  both during the day and after  school.  Students and parents receive a monthly calendar, as well as invitations and notices in their first language to invite and  inform.  ELL Parents are also invited to bi-weekly parent workshops.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Computer technology which incorporates both visual and audio cues are used with ELLs in all the grades. Content area  vocabulary is highlighted through this visual interactive media.   Students in kindergarten through fifth grades receive  computer technology instruction provided by our technology specialist. PS 69Ks a participant of myON, an online leveled book  library with diagnostic assessments for grades K-5. This program is geared towards the ELL population with the support of  listening, reading and writing activities that are differentiated according to level. We also provide access to BrainPOP, which is  an animated and curriculum-based content program online. All classrooms have Smartboards, a digital interactive medium  which permits students to use a laptop as a classroom tool for group or individual instruction in all content subject areas.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is delivered in the Chinese bilingual classes with bilingual books for their libraries. Additionally,  teachers create their own materials in Chinese to support a bilingual learning environment in content areas such as math,  social studies, and science.  Bilingual dictionaries in Chinese and other native languages are available both in the classroom and  the library. For the upper grades, bilingual word to word glossaries in the content areas of math, science and social studies are  available through the NYS Education Department.  For the ENL program model,  direct translation of vocabulary words is a  strategy used to aid comprehension for language acquisition.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All support services and resources correspond to ELLs ages and grade levels. Age appropriate and grade level appropriate  materials are selected to teach multi-level students with different abilities. Guided reading, comprehension strategies and the  Orton-Gillingham approach with explicit phonics instruction are used in small groups with support services.  We use the i- Ready program to differentiate instruction according to students' skills and abilities in reading.   For the support services in  mathematics, the students are grouped according to their math levels on assessments.  Specific grade level mathematics skills  and strategies are taught.  Alternate placement paraprofessionals as per IEP are assigned to ELL students with disabilities to  provide L1 support throughout the day in their classroom.  This additional support helps ELLs with disabilities comprehend  content knowledge and small group instruction.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?

Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   In the future, we are considering arranging events that target newly enrolled ELLs.  Potential activities may include newcomer  events to transition students/parents to their new environment.  School staff involved in such activities include the parent  coordinator, Bilingual and ENL staff.   All new parents of K students ( which are primarily new-admit ELL students) are invited to  a Welcome Morning hosted by the Parent Coordinator and PTA in September. The Parent Coordinator also provides all parents  opportunities for monthly workshops. All newly enrolled students throughout the year receive a packet of information from  the Main Office to assist with routines, expectations, and school policies.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    There are no language electives offered to ELLs.         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   There are no dual language programs.      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The professional development plan for ELL personnel and classroom teachers include mandated and optional professional  development within and outside of school.  Classroom, ELL and bilingual teachers participate in workshops offered by  the NYC Department of Education,  Department of English Language Learners and Student Support and Fordham University  Graduate School of Education NYS/NYC Regional Bilingual Education Resource Network.   The focus in-house professional  development at PS 69 is providing support for all students including the ELLs using the NYC ReadyGen and GoMath programs.  Professional development sessions are conducted weekly by grade with the literacy and math coaches. Teachers and coaches  also meet for extensive planning after each unit of study.  The literacy and math coaches provide extensive support to both  classroom and ESL and Bilingual teachers to implement the complexities of this challenging curriculum. Additionally, the  professional development plan for ELL personnel and non-pedagogic staff during our Monday Professional Learning time  includes the following:    October- Total Physical Response to build and identify vocabulary  November- Visuals within the text to support comprehensible input   December- Chunking Strategies to understand main ideas and details  January- Guided Reading instruction with a focus on language objectives   February- Picture dictionaries to develop and identify vocabulary    March- Summarizing using pictures to recall details  March-  ELL After-School Professional Development for the NYSESLAT  April- Getting ready for the NYSESLAT  May- Using writing rubrics for scoring the NYSESLAT  June- Reflections on ENL program for the school year     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our main focus is to share best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English  language learners. We have designed professional development to focus on vocabulary in the content areas for increased  comprehension for ELLs. The literacy units are thematically based using ReadyGen anchor texts, however, classroom teachers  create their own unit plans with the support of the Literacy Coach. ENL Teachers attend the planning sessions and then  continue to develop and refine supplemental plans to support comprehension through key vocabulary. Our professional  development plans allow us to share out and become resource staff for all teachers across grades.  In addition,  ENL/Bilingual  teachers attend professional development conducted by NYCDOE Department of English Language Learner Student Support  Brooklyn South,  Division of English Language Learners and Student Support as well as Fordham University Graduate School of  Education.

How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The school provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs  arranged on Tuesday afternoons from 2:20 to 3:00 during  parent engagement times.  Parents are invited according to grades and bands of K-1, 2-3, and 4-5. There is a power -point  presentation to show the parents the different aspects of our ENL program, language proficiency levels and how we assess  language development progress.  An overview of the common core standards as it relates to ENL content area instruction is  also presented.  After the power-point, ELL teachers meet with parents in small groups to facilitate further discussions for their  child's needs. Questions are answered on an individual basis for clarifications and concerns.  Translators are provided for  interpretation of the power-point presentation as well as the individual small group parent meeting.  The ENL department  maintains copies of parent invitations letters, agendas and  attendance sheets.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parent involvement is an essential component of our school community. Parents of newly arrived ELLs are invited to several  parent orientation meetings to inform them of their program selection options. The Parent Coordinator is involved in planning  additional meetings for parents of ELLs. The Parent Coordinator plans the Title I parent meeting with translators to inform  parents of the school parent involvement policy and school/parent compact.    The Parent Coordinator also informs parents about our Comprehensive Education Plan (CEP).  Parents are informed about  Parent Leadership positions on our School Leadership Team (SLT), Parent Teacher Association (PTA)  and Parent Advisory  Committee (PAC).  The Parent Coordinator organizes monthly meetings to inform parents of community resources,  happenings, and events. Additionally, the Parent Coordinator organizes monthly informational meetings about curriculum,  Common Core Standards and city-wide testing. The PTA conducts monthly meetings and translators are always  available.  Parents and students participate in monthly “Family Fun Nights” where they attend performances and engage in  hands-on art activities, to promote a positive school culture and community spirit. Parents and community members are also  offered on-site adult ESL classes three days a week for in the afternoon sessions through the New York City Office of Adult  Education.     <!--{cke_protected}%3Cmeta%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%20%2F%3E-->The Parent Coordinator is the key person who assists  in providing the staff and parents information to help students and parents transition to middle school.  She informs 5th grade  teachers and parents about the specialized middle schools programs. She provides an orientation meeting to parents about  procedures and paperwork required for this process.  Information is provided in the student's native language. Additionally,  the parent coordinator assists in organizing the graduation ceremony with the fifth grade teachers.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    <!--{cke_protected}%3Cmeta%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%20%2F%3E-->  P.S. 69 has been recognized as one of the Chancellor's Showcase Schools. The focus is "Integrating the Arts for Student Success"  and visitors get to see the many programs in place that foster language development and acquisition.  Every child in the school receives instruction in Visual Arts and Music from Kindergarten through Fifth Grade. While this is a goal for  many schools, few achieve it with the consistency of P.S. 69. This is reached through their innovative school schedule that covers a  eight-day cycle.  Within the 8-day schedule, teacher meetings (including teachers of Special Education, ENL and Bilingual Education) are also built in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67                       to allow for in-house professional development and planning facilitated by Literacy and Math Coaches which yields rigorous  instruction with access for all.  Arts partnerships promote and enrich students' experiences and promote language. A successful partnership is with TADA! Youth  Theater. This program is provided to enrich the experiences of our Fifth Graders. Using their literacy anchor text, students come up  with and write a musical to perform for their peers. Fifth Grade classes perform thematically related songs to supplement the  learning and vocabulary.  Selected students beginning in First Grade are offered the opportunity to learn violin through the Noel Pointer Foundation.  Instruction is provided by a professional musician twice per week during the school day. Approximately 60 students participate in  this program and about half are current and/or former ELLs. Performances include a Winter Concert, Spring Concert, and visits to  local community events, including a nearby Senior Citizen Home.  Dancing Classrooms teach ballroom dance in a Fifth Grade residency. Participants perform for their peers and families at a  culminating event and a representative team competes in a Dance Match with other schools. This program is for all Fifth Graders,  including ELLs and current and/or former ELLs have often made the select competitive team.  There are three Music teachers who introduce and expand components of music theory within the classroom. In addition to  classroom instruction, the teachers conduct either choral or instrumental music groups. The three teachers will be conducting a  Grade 3 Percussion Group, Grades 4 & 5 Chorus Group, and Grades 4 & 5 Instrumental Band. All students are able to participate in  this, including current and/or former ELLs. Performances include a Winter Concert, Spring Concert, and visits to local community  events, including a nearby Senior Citizen Home.  One music teacher provides additional language support through a co-teaching model to Kindergarten, First Grade and Bilingual  classes. Through live music, students get opportunities to joyfully "sing out" in their new language.   The Leader in Me, a Franklin Covey program, is also at PS69K. The goal of The Leader in Me is to create a culture of student  empowerment and leadership for social-emotional growth in addition to academics.    Mindful Schools is a community of educators that are focused on implementing the practice of mindfulness for themselves and  their students. Students, ELLs and former ELLs in Grades 3-5, are invited to participate in 16-week session. During these  Mindfulness sessions, educators teach strategies for coping and resilience.  All teachers in grades K to 5 coordinate an assembly once per year. This allows all students to participate in a theater production  for their parents and peers.  Additionally, the school provides daytime assemblies in conjunction with Literacy Week celebrations. Visiting artists focus on  theater or storytelling.  The Parent Coordinator and Administration host Family Fun Nights that feature visiting multicultural music or arts programs,  including a Mariachi Band and an African-American Dance troop.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jaynemarie Capetanakis, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities  are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Vincent D.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74        Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      The Language Access Coordinator will attend trainings offered by the Translation and Interpretation Unit. At the  beginning of the school, during a professional development period, the Language Access Coordinator will inform  teachers of the Chancellor's Regulation A-663 and the Translation and Interpretation Unit which offers written  translation, on-site interpretation in 90 languages, and over-the-phone interpretation services in 200 languages.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The school will fulfill the Chancellor’s Regulation that families with Limited English will be provided with a meaningful  opportunity to participate and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education. Upon entering  PS 69, parents are greeted with signs offering Language Services displayed in the main Entry and then repeated  outside the Main Office. These signs are posted in every identified language from PS 69K. Additionally, a Language  Identification Card is on the Main Counter inside the Main Office. This card is presented to non-English speaking  parents, so that they may find their language and identify it to office staff. Over the phone interpretation services are  also available from the NYCDOE Translation and Interpretation Unit; this phone number is listed on the Language  Identification Card. Translators will be provided when needed at workshops and Parent Association meetings to  ensure each family will receive all communications based on their home language survey. Letters sent home will be  translated into the dominate language of need (Chinese and Spanish) to support communication.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Parents are welcomed to voice questions, suggestions and concerns to the school. The Parent Coordinator can direct  the parents to the appropriate person(s) and/or necessary resources. Parents can bring issues and concerns to the  monthly School Leadership Team meeting. A focus group of parents inclusive of all cultures and languages  represented in our school will be asked to meet in order to gather feedback and improve practices. Informal surveys  will be conducted throughout the school year to gather feedback on parents' needs.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75
