This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The vision and mission of PS 65 are: "PS 65 meets the needs of the "whole child". Children do not come in pieces.  They live in families and communities and we feel their involvement is crucial. We believe every child can and will  learn. We commit to fulfilling this mission by enhancing each child's self-concept through academic and social growth,  therein preparing our children to function as responsible citizens in a rapidly changing world. We believe that  students' basic emotional and physical needs must be addressed to enable them to succeed in school and beyond.  Children enter school with a two-sided mind. We will encourage them to use it to develop both types of thinking so   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      that they will have access to their maximum potential and be life-long learners. We believe that arts infusion into the  curriculum is an integral contributor to stimulating and enriching student learning.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.S. 65, The Academy of Innovative Learning, opened in September 2008 as part of the “New Schools’ Initiative”. The  school is grounded in 2 pillars; i.e. careful infusion of the arts into the curriculum and building on children's strengths  to boost their self-esteem. We believe that all children are "children of promise" who can achieve success and be  good citizens of our country. One of the ways in which we accomplish this is by identifying every child’s individual  needs and areas of strength and by using this information to individualize instruction for every child. We recognize  and value our students and we reward them for positive choices. We hold Assemblies in which we celebrate their  achievements, all of which encompass every aspect of the "whole child" and encourage and motivate children to be  the best that they can be. We also celebrate our parents/guardians at these assemblies and reward them for their  “"acts of kindness". Similarly, we work closely with our parents/guardians to assist them in helping their children  succeed. We invite them into our classrooms to see how our instruction takes place, we hold workshops to help them  understand the curriculum, and we meet with them throughout the year to keep them apprised of their child’s  progress. We also work closely with our after-school program to sustain the continuity of the school day and provide  our students with additional support and enrichment. We teach our students to never give up, to believe in  themselves and to try. We encourage hard work, recognize and value all students’ efforts, and know each student  individually so that they make a strong connection with our school.   PS 65 currently serves 439 students in grades PK-grade 5. We have a student body of 201 male students and 248  female students. Our school has a 94.9% attendance rate, and is comprised of 42.3% Hispanic or Latino, 27.7% Black  or African American, 24.6% White, 2.6& Asian or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and 2.8% Multi-Racial. Our Title I  population is 52.7%, with 49.5% free lunch.    PS 65 works closely with Staten Island Mental Health, the Jewish Community Center, the Jewish Board, Project  Hospitality, Goodhue Center, & many other charitable organizations via our "Grade 5 Student Council". The student  council hosts many fundraisers to assist our community as well as outside communities who need our help. We want  our students to understand that it is important to "give back" to the community. Our students have raised money to  help cancer patients, to collect goods for the homeless, to gather supplies for victims of natural disasters, and to visit  the elderly to display "acts of kindness".   PS 65 is very focused, academically rigorous, and student-centered. Skills and strategies scaffold throughout the  grades, continuity is across every classroom and grade, and assessment is an integral part of the differentiation that is  in place. There is a true sense of community amongst the administration, staff, students, and their families. We  believe that it does “take a whole village to raise a child”.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   PS 65 has an ENL population of 7.3%. Currently they are serviced in a push-in and pullout model of service. PS 65  supports all of our learners, including Students with Disabilities and our ENL learners with research-based strategies  and programs, such as: Orton-Gillingham, Fundations, Wilson, hands-on math, and programs students into groupings  all day to meet their individual needs and learning styles. We are working on ensuring that all of our students become  "assessment-capable learners" and are able to identify their goal, where they are in attaining their goals, and what  their "next steps" should be.port is provided by a certified ENL teacher.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      4.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.        Data meetings & team meetings are used to conduct professional development as well as to identify students who are  struggling and research strategies, materials and programs that will best meet every child’s needs. Teachers and  administrators select and review assessments and determine which best meets the needs of every student in their  class. This year PS 65 has teamed up with other school in the Core Collaborative PD to focus on Formative  Assessments and how to align the standards with our assessments. Teachers are part of this initiative, and they will  develop the formative assessments that are aligned to the standards and to the tasks in our Curriculum Maps they  use in their classrooms.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41     may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42            IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 65, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 65 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  1. Classroom teachers utilize  Fountas and Pinnell, conference notes and informal observations to assess the early literacy skills  of ELLs.  These assessment tools will help to identify specific student needs and align instruction.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2. We have monthly data meetings to assess how the students are progressing.  Depending on the results, we will implement  appropriate interventions that are needed.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  3. We will evaluate the success of our program with ELLs by analyzing the results of the NYSESLAT exam and comparing results  of each child from year to year to see if the child is progressing to the next level (example: from low intermediate/emerging to  intermediate/transitioning level); and also look at state test results (ELA and Math State tests) to see if the ELLs are  progressing.  For kindergarten and first grade we also use Math inventories.  For second to fifth grade we use Math  Performance Tasks. From kindergarten to fifth we use Fountas and Pinnell.  We also continually confer with the ELL's  classroom teachers to see how they are progressing in the classroom.          4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    4. After the summative data has been gathered, we will make sure that any student who needs additional assistance in their  academic progress will get the necessary interventions such as AIS, speech, after-school programs, Lexia, RAZ Kids, etc.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   5. Based on our data,  we will pinpoint our individual ELLs academic needs and provide instruction in accordance to the  RTI  framework. We will provide rigorous and evidence based curriculum and English language development supports in the Tier I  instructional model in both the regular classroom and the ENL program.  If we see some students struggling,  we  will provide  them with Tier II instructional supports  such as , extra attention and more diffentiated activities to help and guide them so  that they can get the most support in their academic studies.  If a student still needs additional support after the Tier I and Tier  II instructional supports have been implemented those students will be targeted as receiving Tier III instructional supports,  which include intensive and individualized instruction (small group or 1:1 support).     The support services provided must be aligned to any intervention plans (e.g., Academic Intervention Services) the school is  already providing to all students. There are RTI resources for ELL educators on the DELLSS’ website.                 6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   6. According to the Spring 2016 NYSESLAT, three kindergarten students scored at the expanding level, two first graders scored  at the transitioning levels, and one first grader scored at the expanding level. One second grader scored at the  transitioning level. Three third graders scored at the transitioning level.Two fourth grades scored at expanding level and one at  the transitioning level. For the students who took the NYSITELL, one  kindergarten student scored at the expanding level.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We will download the test NYSESLAT and NYSITELL results from the RLAT function in ATS and disseminate the results of the  NYSESLAT and NYSITELL to all administration and classroom teachers so that we can evaluate the success or our programs with  ELLs.  By analyzing the results of the NYSESLAT exam and comparing results of each child from year to year, we will see if the  child is progressing to the next level (example: from low intermediate/emerging level to intermediate/transitioning level).  We  will also look at state test results (ELA and Math State tests) to see if the ELLs are progressing, and confer with the classroom  teachers to monitor progress in the classroom.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         a.  Freestanding ENL program.            Our ELL students' instruction is delivered through a combination of integrated and standalone ENL services.  The  certified ENL teacher collaborates with the classroom teacher in order to plan and implement instruction during  scheduled integrated ENL services. For ENL standalone services, students are grouped heterogenously within a two  grade span, except for ELL students in special education classes.             In order to move towards an organizational model that fulfills the CR Part 154 requirements for English as a New  Language, the administration structured this year's class lists so that all of the ELLs on a grade will be placed in the  same classroom, to the fullest extent possible.  In this way, the ESL teacher is able to service students through  integrated ENL services as much as possible . However, since the ENL Teacher is itinerant, our organizational model  must rely somewhat upon standalone services for a portion of the program in order to ensure that students receive  the full amount of their NYS CR part 154 mandated number of units of service of support.  The administration plans to  continue to structure future class lists so that all the ELLs on a grade are placed in the same classroom, to the fullest  extent possible, in order to ensure that the majority of ELL students can be serviced by following the breakdown of  total ENL minutes as per CR Part 154 requirements for ENL services.          b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     n/a     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      n/a   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              2. There are 5 proficiency levels for ELLs based on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT.  According to CR Part 154 requirements  for English as a New Language, grades K-8, the total minutes of ENL instruction are as follows: Entering and Emerging levels  need 2 units of study per week (360 minutes); Transitioning and expanding levels need 1 unit of study per week (180 minutes);  Commanding level needs .5 units of integrated study per week (90 minutes) for two additional years.  The school ensures the  mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each program model by first having a  certified ENL teacher, Mrs. Coraci, cover the ENL instructional program. Also, the administration structured this year's class  lists so that all of the ELLs on a grade will be placed in the same classroom, to the fullest extent possible.  In this way, the ENL  teacher is able to service students through integrated ENL services as much as possible. However, since the ENL Teacher is  itinerant, our organizational model must rely somewhat upon standalone services for a portion of the program in order to  ensure that students receive the full amount of their NYS CR part 154 mandated number of units of service of support.  The  administration plans to continue to structure future class lists so that all the ELLs on a grade are placed in the same classroom,  to the fullest extent possible, in order to ensure that the majority of ELL students can be serviced by following the breakdown  of total ENL minutes as per CR Part 154 requirements for ENL services.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      3.  The ESL teacher is state certified in ESL instruction by New York State.  In addition, she is licensed in Common Branches by  New York State.  The current instructional program, which is delivered in English,  fosters language development and meets  the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards.  Our program includes the use of sheltered instruction in the content  areas, TPR, hands-on activities, manipulatives, pictures, music and movement, frequent access to language learning software  and various online educational websites, and employs a broad range of literacy strategies to support the ELL students.  In  addition, resources that align with Fundations and Harcourt Math are utilized to reinforce what the children are learning in  class.                Classroom teachers collaborate with the ESL teacher to ensure that content presented in the English language is made  comprehensible to ELLs through appropriate application of ENL language learning methods and strategies, such as those   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      described above.  The ENL program includes an integrated  component that has been implemented to ensure that students  receive the necessary support during content area instruction.  Additionally, the ENL Teacher collaborates with the AIS  teachers and related service providers who service ELLs to ensure that appropriate strategies, methods, and approaches are  utilized in the AIS program and during related service sessions.                   4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      4.  Students who are Spanish dominant and do not score proficient on the NYSITELL are administered the Spanish LAB.  At the  present time, PS 65 does not have sufficient numbers in order to sustain a TBE or DL class.  However, in the event that the  school should open a TBE or DL program, native language assessments such as EL SOL, ELE Spanish Reading Test, or Chinese  Reading Test or other formal assessments in the language of instruction in the TBE or DL program other than English will be  utilized to appropriately evaluate students in their native language(s).            5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    5..  Instruction is differentiated based on the individual child’s English language proficiency in each of the five modalities, as  well as what is developmentally appropriate for the child’s age and grade level.  The AIS teachers, and related service providers  offer assistance in differentiating instruction to meet the needs of a multi-age class with mixed proficiency levels and diverse  needs to ensure that additional appropriate strategies, methods and approaches are integrated into the ENL program .            a) We are currently not servicing any SIFE students.  In the event that we need to provide service to a SIFE student, the  student will be assessed and provided with the required ENL instruction in addition to any other intervention services found to  be necessary.  Additional services may include one on one tutoring through the Reading Volunteer Program, participation in an  AIS program,  Raz Kids, and/or LEXIA, Sonday, Fundations RTI program, Orton-Gillingham, Wilson Reading Program for grades  3-5, participation in the after-school tutoring program, parent support workshops or other available support  services.  Additionally, the ENL teacher, classroom teachers, AIS teachers, and related service provider(s) would collaborate to  ensure that the academic and language learning needs, as well as additional special needs, of all SIFE students are addressed.          b) Newcomers receive targeted instruction in the four modalities through integrated and standalone ENL services, as well as  benefit from the continued collaboration among the ENL Teacher, classroom teachers,  related service provider(s) and AIS  teachers to ensure that each ELL’s academic and language learning needs, as well as additional special needs, are  addressed.  We currently have eight ELLs in the testing grades.  The students receive additional academic and linguistic  support through participation of intervention services that are available at the school such as, Fundations RTI, Wilson reading  program, Orton-Gillingham,  Raz Kids,  and LEXIA.  Newcomers in testing grades will also receive the testing accommodations  mandated for ELLs by New York State, which will also be extended to former ELLs for up to two years after scoring  Commanding on the NYSESLAT.  Parent meetings of current and former ELLs in the testing grades will also be conducted in the  parents’ languages of choice to ensure that parents are aware of the testing requirements and to address their questions and  concerns.  Since NCLB now requires ELA testing for ELLs after one year, ELLs in this subgroup will receive additional services  based upon his or her academic and linguistic needs, such as one on one tutoring through the Reading Volunteer Program,  participation in an AIS program, Fundations RTI program, Orton Gillingham, Wilson Reading Program for grades 3-5, Raz Kids,  and/or LEXIA, Sonday, participation in related service(s), after-school tutoring program, parent support workshops or other  available support services.          c) Developing student instruction will be supported through differentiated instruction designed to enable each student to  achieve individual goals related to academics, language, and other special needs.  Additional services may include one on one  tutoring through the Reading Volunteer Program, participation in an AIS program, Fundations RTI program, Orton Gillingham,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      Wilson Reading Program for grades 3-5, Raz Kids, LEXIA. Sonday, participation in related service(s), after-school tutoring  program, parent support workshops or other available support services.          d) PS 65 does not currently have any Long Term ELL students.  In the event that we need to provide service to a long term  ELL student, the student would be provided with the required ENL instruction in addition to any other intervention services  found necessary.  Additional services may include one on one tutoring through the Reading Volunteer Program, participation  in an AIS program, Fundations RTI,  Orton-Gillingham, Raz Kids,  LEXIA, Sonday, participation in related service(s), inclusion in  the After-school program, parent support workshops or other available support services. Additionally, the ENL teacher,  classroom teachers, related service provider(s) and AIS teachers would collaborate to ensure that the academic and language  learning needs, as well as other special needs, of all LTE students are addressed.                  e) Former ELLs will be supported in instruction by receiving integrated ENL services for 90 minutes per week for an  additional two year after they have scored Commanding level on the NYSESLAT. During the integrated ENL services, the ENL  teacher will collaborate with the classroom teacher and come up with strategies that will help the former ELL student succeed  in ELA, Math and content subjects. Also, for 2 years after the former ELL students pass the NYSESLAT, (reach the Commanding  level), they will get additional time (time and a half) on the ELA exam in the spring.               6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   6..   ELLs who have been identified as having special needs have been placed in accordance with his/her IEP, which indicates  specific ENL instruction in addition to any special education services needed.  ENL instruction is differentiated in order to meet  the special needs of individual students, increase academic achievement, and support language acquisition.   Paraprofessionals  assigned to Special Education ELLs accompany their students during standalone ENL services.  Additionally, the ENL teacher,  classroom teachers, paraprofessionals, coach, related service providers, and AIS teachers collaborate to ensure that the  academic and language learning needs of all ELL-SWD students are addressed, as well as other special needs.  Additional  services to which ELL-SWDs are entitled include one on one tutoring through the Reading Volunteer Program, participation in  an AIS program,  Raz Kids, Fundations RTI, Orton-Gillingham, Wilson Reading Program for grades 3-5, LEXIA,  participation in  related service(s), inclusion in the after-school tutoring program, parent support workshops or other available support  services.            Special Education teachers implement the same literacy and content curricula as their General Education  counterparts.  Daily academic content area instruction in the classroom incorporates the use of research-based academic and  language learning strategies that have been found to be successful with ELLs with special needs, as well as manipulatives,  visuals, realia, hands-on activities, TPR, and music and movement to facilitate the acquisition of language and content area  knowledge.  The ENL Teacher and classroom teachers of ELL-SWDs collaborate to ensure that ESL language learning strategies  are integrated into each lesson to support student achievement of both academic and linguisitic goals.           7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  7..       PS 65 uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse academic and linguistic needs of ELL- SWDs within the least restrictive environment.   All ELL-SWDs are placed in the least restrictive environment according to the  requirements indicated on the most current IEP of each child.  The ELL-SWDs whose IEPs require an alternate placement  paraprofessional are assigned an alternate placement paraprofessional in the classroom.  Additionally, alternate placement  paraprofessionals accompany the ELL-SWDs to whom they are assigned to standalone ENL services.  All Special Education  teachers implement the same literacy and content curricula as their General Education counterparts.  The ENL Teacher, Special  Education teachers, paraprofessionals (including alternate placement paraprofessionals), AIS teachers,  aand related service  provider(s)  collaborate to ensure that all ELL-SWDs are able to achieve curricular goals through support provided through ENL  teaching methods and learning strategies and other research-based instructional practices that have been proven to be   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      successful in making content comprehensible and further supporting English language acquisition for ELL-SWDs.  Scheduling  flexibility in the ESL program allows for the ESL Teacher to provide integrated services during content area studies as well as  literacy instruction.  When appropriate, scheduling flexibility in the ENL program also allows for ELL-SWDs to be mainstreamed  into General Education settings during content area and/or literacy instruction.  Mainstreaming decisions for individual ELL- SWDs are achieved through collaboration and discussion among the ESL Teacher, Special Education teacher, paraprofessional,  AIS teacher, related service provider(s), and administrators  so that the most appropriate instruction for the ELL-SWD may be  delivered in the least restrictive environment.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  8. The AIS teacher provides targeted intervention services in ELA and Math through the AIS program.  All AIS instruction is  delivered in English.  AIS programs include Sonday,  and interactive software that provides differentiated instruction in early  literacy and numeracy skills.  Such interactive software programs utilized in the AIS program include Raz Kids,  and  LEXIA.  Additional intervention services available include one-to-one tutoring through the Reading Volunteer Program and  inclusion in the afterschool  program, Fundations RTI, Wilson Reading Program for grades 3-5 and the new Orton- Gillinham program.  Parent support workshops are also offered periodically. All ELLs in need of intervention may participate in  any or all of these available services.  Newcomers, SIFE, developing, and ELLs with special needs will be recommended based  upon individual needs.            9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       9. PS 65 has implemented a new program called: Orton-Gillingham. The administration has sent staff this year (2017) to get  training in it.  This program has been recently added and will continue in the upcoming school year. Also, the IEP teacher was  sent to get training in the SPIRE reading program, and this program will be utilized in the upcoming school year.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   10.  No ELL services or programs have been discontinued.  PS 65 continues to provide the same programs and services for ELLs  that have been in place from previous years.          11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  11.  All ELLs and former ELLs may participate in all before- and after-school programs and supplemental services, including  Afterschool program for ELA and Math review, Reading Volunteer Program, and AIS programs.  All school bulletins, notices and  permission forms, including those that pertain to school programs, are distributed in English as well as the native languages of  our ELL families.  Additionally, such information is posted in the native languages of our families on the school website.  These  measures ensure that equal access to all school programs is afforded to our ELLs and that their full participation in such school  programs is encouraged and supported by all school staff.  Since PS 65 enrolled fewer that 30 ELLS during the previous school  year, PS 65 was not granted funds to operate a Title III program this school year.  Therefore, the only after school and  supplemental services available to ELLs are those described above, which are open to all PS 65 students regardless of ELL  status.             12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  12.  The current instructional program includes the use of sheltered instruction in the content areas, TPR, hands-on activities,  manipulatives, realia, pictures, smartboard, music and movement and employs a broad range of literacy strategies to support  the ELL student.  In addition, resources that align  with Fundations and Harcourt Math are utilized to reinforce what the  children are learning in class. Sonday, and interactive software such as LEXIA,  Raz Kids,  are utilized to support the academic  progress and achievement of ELLs.  ELLs also have access to a variety of language learning software such as Kidspiration, a  literacy and numeracy software designed for English Language Learners, all of which is compatible with Smartboard   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         technology.           13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   13.  Books, dictionaries, and materials in the students' native languages are utilized in the ENL classroom to provide Native  Language Support.  Additionally, whenever possible, newcomers are assigned a "buddy" who is fluent in the newcomer's home  language and English to assist the newcomer as he or she adjusts to the new school setting.  Multicultural studies are also  integrated into the ENL curriculum.          14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    14.   Required services support and resources correspond to ELLs' age and grade levels by having the teachers who provide  academic intervention services to ELLs consult the ENL teacher to ensure that all services and resources are appropriate for  each student's individual age, grade levels, and language learning needs.  When appropriate, instruction is differentiated and  resources are modified to meet the needs of the learners.               15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    15.  PS 65 does not share a building at this time.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   16.  In the event that the school is aware of an incoming ELL student, prior to the beginning of the school year, opportunities  such as inclusion in parent workshops, school tour, program review, and access to supplemental materials in English and/or  the native language appropriate for the child are made available. For instance, the parent coordinator, Norma Santaliz  provides parent workshops throughout the year in their native language, which is mostly Spanish.  The full-time school  counselor, Elizabeth Rodriguez, offers her time to answer parental concerns and she keeps in contact with newly enrolled ELLs  throughout the year to ensure that they are having a smooth transition into their new school. Any oral and written  communication will be provided in the parent's language of choice.          17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    17. There are no language electives offered to students at PS 65 at this time.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   n/a       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  1.  PS 65 provides Professional Development and support for all school staff.  Professional development for all personnel  working with ELLs (including the ESL Teacher, General Education teachers, Special Education teachers, cluster teachers, AIS  teachers, coach, paraprofessionals, guidance counselor, psychologist, occupational/physical therapists, speech therapists,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         secretaries, parent coordinator, and adminstrators) will take place during available time throughout the year including  designated professional development days, monthly faculty and grade conferences, preparation periods, and after school  workshops.  Examples of professional development includes: Sonday and Guided Reading training for Paraprofessionals every  Monday; Ongoing Professional Development in RTI, Fundations, Writing Maps, Learning Intentions (Success Criteria).  Writing  and grammar focus PD for September and October.  Verb PD focus for November and December.  Parent workshops on  benchmarks are given every other month.        2. Our school offers professional development to teachers of ELLs and all other teachers in supporting ELLs as they engage in  the Common Core Standards.  This professional develoment includes: Aligning Curriculum to the Common Core  Standards,  Benchmarks, Checklists,  Standards of "High Quality Work", Generating Assessment Materials for  Parents/Guardians, Analyzing the Danielson Famework: for example: Danielson's domain 3 (questioning techniques),  faculty  meetings,  grade-level meetings,  UDL (Universal Design for Learning), Text complexity, Sonday.            2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  2.  As per CR Part 154.2, all staff will receive at minimum 15% of total hours for professional development requirements in ENL  specific professional development. The ENL-specific professional develoment for bilingual eductation/ENL teachers will be 50%  of the total professional development.  This will be achieved through participation in Professional Development sessions with  issues related to ELLs, either in-house or provided by organizations such as, the Division of Engish Language Learners and  Student Support (DELLSS), NYS TESOL, NYSABE.  The school will maintain a record of each staff member’s attendance at such  workshops.             Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   1. Our school provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language development  progress, language proficiency results, and language development needs in all content areas.  The ENL teacher conducts these  meetings throughout the year.  She will meet with individual parents and sometimes sponsor a workshop for ELL parents.  For  example, in the spring the ENL teacher will conduct a workshop for parents and their children on explaining the NYSESLAT and  what parents and children can do to help prepare for it. Translatation is available during these meetings. For example, our  Parent Coordinator, Norma Santaliz, provides Spanish translation.  If we need any other language translated we will ask parent  volunteers to translate or if no one is available, we will utilize the DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   2.. Mrs. Norma Santaliz, our Parent Coordinator, is a fluent speaker of Spanish and is always available to provide translation  and interpretation services when necessary.  Additionally, Ms. Santaliz works closely with the ENL teacher to reach out to our  ELL families and encourage parental involvement.  PS 65 distributes all school bulletins, notices, and permission forms in both  English and the native languages of our families.  Additionally, information on the school website is posted in the native  languages of our families.  Staff fluent in the native languages other than Spanish of our families are available to interpret  when necessary.  These measures ensure that the parents of ELLs will be kept abreast of all activities in which parental  involvement is encouraged.  Such activities include, but are not limited to, the following: attendance at parent-teacher  conferences, participation in the PTA, class parent roles and responsibilities, and attendance at monthly school assemblies and      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         other in-house activities (ex: classroom publishing parties).      Common translated signs that have been downloaded from the DOE's Translation Resources website are displayed  prominently in the Main Office.       The ENL teacher maintains a binder of all DOE -produced ELL Parent Information surveys, informational documents, and  notifications relevant to the ELL identification and placement process in the available translated versions. If the translation of  other critical, school-issued surveys, informational documents and notifications cannot be completed in-house by a school  staff member or parent volunteer, services offered by the DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit are utilized.  The ENL  teacher is responsible for completing and submitting Translation Request Forms to the DOE Translation and Interpretation  Unit.  The ENL teacher aims to submit the Translation Request Forms and the file(s) to be translated to  translations@schools.nyc.gov as early as possible to ensure timely provision of translated documents to parents determined to  be in need of language assistance services.       When necessary, the school obtains translation services in additional languages via external, DOE-contracted vendors.  Again,  the ENL teacher aims to submit requests as early as possible to ensure timely provision of translated documents to parents  determined to be in need of language assistance services.       The Parent Coordinator translates written school bulletins, notices and forms into Spanish.   English/Spanish bulletins, notices  and forms are routinely distributed.  In addition, the Parent Coordinator updates the school website with important  information in Spanish.        The Parent Coordinator provides oral interpretation services in Spanish.  In the event that a staff member or parent volunteer  is not available to translate, the school utilizes the DOE Over-the-Phone Interpretation Services available through the  Translation and Interpretation Unit at 718.752.7373 ext. 4.  If necessary, the school will apply its translation/interpretation  funding allocations in order to contract LIS to cover interpretation needs.      In the event that interpretation services are required for on-site central events in which the parents of ELLs are participating,  the ENL teacher will be responsible for completing and submitting Interpretation Request Forms to the DOE Translation and  Interpretation Unit to translations@schools.nyc.gov.     Several times each year, the ENL Teacher and Parent Coordinator conduct workshops and meetings for the parents of ELLs and  former ELLs, with the assistance of staff who are fluent in the parents’ languages of choice or the DOE’s Over-the-Phone  Interpretation Services if necessary.  These sessions include, but are not limited to, the following: Parent Orientation of Newly  Enrolled ELLs, Fall Workshop on ENSL Program Expectations, Spring Workshop on Strategies for Preparing Students for the  NYSESLAT, and June Workshop on Strategies for Assisting ELLs in Maintaining Progress Throughout the Summer.    Other  workshops offered to parents include: "Family Math Game Night", in this workshop parents and children get to reinforce math  skills and problem solving strategies by playing math games.  Parents are also allowed to take home math kits to continue to  be involved with their children's math skills development.  There are also parent workshops during PTA meetings given by  teachers.  Topics include: vocabulary development, test preparation, using the word wall, sight words, text complexity, etc.               Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Sophie Scamardella, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 65 Academy of Innovative L.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      At registration, all parents are administered the Home Language Identification Survey. The parent may select to  complete the form in either English or the native language. The ENL teacher and Parent Coordinator, who is fluent  in Spanish, are present to explain the purpose of the HLIS to the parent. If necessary, school staff fluent in the  parent's native language are available to assist in interpretation, or the DOE Over-the-Phone Interpretation  Service may be utilized.    In Section 3 of the HLIS, the parent indicates the language(s) that s/he would like to communicate both orally and  in writing with school staff. The ENL teacher uses data obtained from Section 3 of the HLIS in order to pre-assess  which language(s) will be needed for the current school year. The ENL teacher then updates the record of parent  language preferences, which is maintained and continually updated by the ENL teacher throughout the school  year. Primary language information is shared with the administration, Pupil Accounting secretary, and Parent  Coordinator. Classroom teachers of students whose parents have selected to communicate in another language  are notified. The ENL teacher and Parent Coordinator work together to provide translated school notices and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      forms, as well as arranging for any interpretation services that may be required at face-to-face meetings such as  Parent Teacher Conferences and IEP meetings. Learning Environment surveys in various languages other than  English are made available to parents and guardians. In addition, the ENL Teacher evaluates the needs and  interests of ELL families through the use of surveys to obtain feedback from the parents on resources and services  offered. For example, a survey was utilized to determine the level of interest that our ELL parents have in  participating in a proposed adult ENL class to be held at the school                   2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of a school emergency, we will reach all parents including limited-English proficient families through:  ROBO call. This is a special phone call that goes out to alert all parents in their native languages.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      The school administration will ensure staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 through  various staff meetings and PDs. They will inform them of the resources available such as bi-lingual staff and also give  them the information to contact the DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      In order to fulfill Section VII of Chancellor's Regulations A-663 regarding parental notification requirements for  translation and interpretation services, each parent/guardian who is in need of language assistance will receive a copy  of the DOE's Bill of Parent's Rights and Responsibilities in the primary language, including information regarding the  parental right to translation and interpretation services. Signs indicating the availability of translation and  interpretation services will be prominently displayed in the Main Office. In addition, the school's safety plan will  include procedures for ensuring that parents will not be prevented from communicating with school staff solely due  to a language barrier.         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We will use parent surveys to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services. We have  implemented the feedback to improve the language services by making sure that all parents receive the proper  language services. If we can't address all the languages, we will utilize the DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit for  assistance.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67
