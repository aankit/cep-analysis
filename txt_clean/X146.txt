This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of the Edward J Collins: P.S. 146x school community is to create a safe learning environment that is  conducive to learning and allows each student to maximize their potential. We believe that all children can learn  when they are provided effective instruction, a proper learning environment, and a strong sense of community. The  collaboration between parents, educators, school communities, and external stakeholders will ensure that our  students are consistently ready for the next level, in turn, making them college and career-ready.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   The Edward J. Collins School (P.S. 146X) is an elementary school that has 407 students from pre-kindergarten through  grade 5. The school population is comprised of 45% Black, 54% Hispanic and 1% Asian students. 12% of the students  who attend P.S. 146X receive special education services, and 11% of the student body are English language learners.   The mission of National Training Network (NTN) is to build a nation of mathematically sound thinkers who have deep  conceptual understanding through the provision of high quality math professional development to educators.   P.S. 146 has also chosen to partner with the The New Teacher Center (NTC) program, LitLife ELA consultant and the  NTN Mathematics consultant for the 2018-2019 school year. The New Teacher Center (NTC) program, LitLife ELA  consultant, the NTN Mathematics, Integrated Co-Teaching/ Specially Designed Instruction (ICT/SDI) Consultant and  Dreamyard for the Arts program consultant will be:   Supporting teachers in their planning and preparation of daily instruction     Providing professional development    Mentoring new teachers      Modeling lessons in the classroom      Providing feedback to the teachers     Supporting teachers in the classroom   Supporting teachers during their team meetings   Parent engagement in education is one of the biggest predictors of student success. P.S. 146x will conduct a minimum  of five workshops aimed exclusively towards building the capacity of our parents.      The instructional after school extended day for our third through fifth grade students will begin in November 2018  and extend to March 2019.       The instructional after school extended day for our first and second grade English language learners will also begin in  November 2018 and extend to March 2019 for ELA and to April 2019 for Math.    Elective programs play an essential role in providing a student with a well rounded education. We educate the whole  child by incorporating the arts into the school day. The following elective programs will be in full effect for the 2018–  2019 school year:     Art Instruction    Poetry Program    Technology Instruction    Music Instruction     Lego Robotics      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Character education helps to develop a positive school climate. Included in this is our "Book of the Month." Teaching  our students how to be kind, caring and considerate is one of our main goals of the school community of P.S. 146x.  When done effectively, character education will reduce discipline referrals, decrease bullying, and increase academic  achievement for all learners.       Steps to Success and C.A.R.E. (Citizenship, Achievement, Respect, and Effort) are programs we use to aid the character  building of the students that attend our school. These programs consist of developing structures for teaching  expected behaviors and social skills by rewarding positive behaviors.       Classes are able to earn “Big Feet” in recognition of the positive behaviors they may demonstrate as a whole.  Individual students are able to earn “Gold Slips” for notable individual exhibited behaviors. Students are able to use  the Gold Slips they have earned to shop in our "Lions CARE" store events that take place three times a year.      Show you-CARE-Program   The CARE program at PS 146x focuses on teaching the entire school community about Citizenship, Achievement,  Respect, and Effort. Students caught demonstrating any of these attributes is acknowledge by staff members and the  principal every morning during morning announcements. Students receive gold slips which is part of our PBIS program  as acknowledgement and reminder of their good deeds. Names of students are then placed on our CARE wall for all to  see.      Lions Help Cubs: Peer Mediation Program   This year, we implemented a "Lions help Cubs," club. The lions helps Cubs program is a cross-aged mentoring program  for Kindergarten and 5th grade students.   5th grade students or "Lions" spend a semester in the kindergarten classroom and integrate social skills lessons and  literacy skills with their "Cub." 5th graders also have the opportunity to enhance their leadership skills by modeling  positive behaviors to their "Kinder Buddy."      Peer Mediation Program   We continue to implement a Peer mediation program. 4th and 5th grade students apply to become peer mediators  through an application and interview process. Once selected, peer mediators are trained in conflict resolution skills  and serve as problem solving mediators to their fellow peers. The Peer Mediators are also on the front line with  raising Anti-Bullying awareness in the school. They help coordinate the Respect for All initiative in spreading respect  and tolerance for all.       In addition, the social worker and school counselor created a Peer-Mediator club. Students from the upper grades  help their fellow students with conflict resolution.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      The overall goal of the P.S. 146x staff and school community is to graduate students with academic excellence,  leadership skills, and distinguished moral principles that will make them college and career ready.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   12% of the students who attend P.S. 146x receive special education services and 11% of the student body are English  language learners. As a result, P.S. 146X has identified instructional reading levels as an area of focus for the 2018- 2019 school year. Increasing the reading levels, and the comprehension of complex text, is a goal for all of our  students. We discovered specific needs of this population are     Reading Stamina    Writing stamina    Math computational skills    Acquisition of language         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The element of the Framework for which P.S. 146x has made the most progress over the 2017-2018 school year is in  Collaborative Teachers and Effective School Leadership. At P.S. 146x we believe students and teachers benefit in a  variety of ways staff works together. A small, but growing body of evidence suggests a positive relationship between  teacher collaboration and student achievement. This is why we quickly established teams and provided time for these  teams to meet. Our mission was to have collaborative teachers aligned with engaging, rigorous, and coherent  curricula in all subject areas to allow access to a variety of learners. This was coupled with an alignment to the Quality  Review during the 2017-18 school year, which was our area of Celebration. However, even though P.S. 146x has made  significant progress in the element of Collaborative Teachers, it will continue to be an area of focus along with  ensuring engaging, rigorous, and coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners and aligned to  Common Core Learning Standards and/or content standards for the 2018-2019 school year. Careful data analysis of  our on-going assessments and analysis of student learning outcomes has led P.S. 146X to identify instructional reading  levels as an area of focus for the 2018-2019 school year. Increasing the reading levels, genre identification, and the  comprehension of complex text are goals for all of our students. However, there will be a special concentration on  increasing the instructional reading levels of the students in kindergarten through second grade. The resources that  we will use to help reach this goal have been included in our budget. The resources are:   Lit Life: ELA/Writing       Envision Mathematics: NTN Consultants        Fundations/ Phonics  ICT/SDI Consultant   Further review of the performance of our students on the New York State testing grades has also led us to identify  academic writing in grade three through grade five as an additional area of focus for the 2018-2019 school year. In  addition to the resources stated above, we will be using the resources stated below to improve the writing skills of  our students.      Writing Poetry Program    Elements of TC writing(i.e. pathways check list, TC rubrics)         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 08X146   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   408   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 146x, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.S. 146x will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The early literacy skills of ELLs  are assessed with NYSTITELL, MOSL ,NYSESLAT, Fundations and Writing Pathways/Baseline  writing.  ELLs in grades K-2 are also assessed, on a continual basis with the computer-based program I-Read.  Ongoing  assessment of running record is also part of Fountas and Pinnell.  ELLs are also assessed through the year in Fountas and  Pinnell running records and progress is tracked through the benchmarks of ELA and Math Rally Tests .       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   In order to support this effort, the ENL teacher plans with all teachers of ENL students.  This is done so that the students  strengths and weaknesses can be properly address.  All classrooms have computers, Smart boards, and materials to further the  students development.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The summative assessments that are used to identify areas of need are Envision Baseline, Rally, Fontas and Pinnell, NYSTITELL,  NYSESLAT, and Writing Pathways/ Baseline Writing. These assessments have shown that the areas that need improvement are  in reading and writing.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The school provides the students with RTI programs.  ENL lessons that are prepared with content area teachers. Writing  rubrics are used that come from the Writing Pathways.  Envision Math programs come with vocabulary,  reading, problem  solving, and writing. Guided reading and the Fundations program address students individual needs.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   RTI for ELL students is designed to add layers of support to the standard core curriculum.  These layers of support diminish or  increase over time according to the students' needs.  The ELL students are given the AIMSWEB assessment which is an  universal screening.  This  give the teachers clear indicators of tier I, II, and III in specific domains based on the  benchmarks.   Once the students are flagged as being at risk a plan of instructional support will be delivered to the students  with language support services.  Voyager Passport and Ticket To Read ELA RTI programs.   There is an initial assessment for the  tier III students identify in Aimsweb.  ELL students are included  and are instructed in a group of 8-10 students. will be taught  through small group instruction.  The instruction is differentiated by the the children skill level.  This instruction addresses  native and second language concerns by identifying lack of specific skills or deficiencies for support. For Voyager there is  interaction with student and teacher with meaningful discussion and guided reading  which allow development of second  language skills. Ticket To Read is an online program that is differentiated at the children reading level.  Both  programs  generate data.  Four times for the year, data is sent home to parents for to inform them of the ELLs progress.  ELA  RTI has demonstrated improvement in ELLs comprehension of the core subjects and reduce the referral rate.l     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The outcome that has resulted from the NYSELAT, ELA, and Math results show that although the ELLs have improved, there is  still more work to be done in regards to the reading and writing.  The NYSESLAT results show that there are a significant lower  number of EM level students than previously.  According to the ELA and Math results of Spring 2017, the ELL students showed  growth in comparison to the previous year. These results assist in the planning of the ELL instruction and in the classroom  teachers lesson planning.  The ENL teacher and classroom teachers plan together in order to insure that the students are able  to receive the extra help in the areas that they are weak in.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The use of the ELL Data Analysis Tool is an invaluable instrument that  list all of the students academic information.  This  document is an important tool because at a glance you can see what are the strengths and weaknesses of each student.  It can  be used to set up programming around students needs.  It can be used when lesson planning, driving instruction, and for  common planning between the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   ENL instruction is delivered through push-in and pull out sessions.  These sessions adhere to the minutes that are  required by each level.  The ENL teacher works with the content area teachers to deliver content to the students with  ENL support. The students receive support in all subjects and also receive the required minutes that a pull out  program gives them.  This means that through the pull out session, the students receive ENL support, while being in a  smaller group with only other ENL students.  The ENL students that are pulled out to the ENL classroom are provided  with supplemental instruction that addresses their particular needs.  Grouping is heterogeneous, mixing ELLS at all  proficiency levels.  Push in groups are done with K and 1 students.  Pull out in ENL groups is with combine adjacent  grades of 2-3 or 4-5 students grouped together.  ENL groups are also mixed together with special education and  general education ELLS.     b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              P.S.146 has one fully-certified full-time ENL teacher serving 39 ELLS and 7 former ELLS.  Students at the Entering level  receive four periods of pull out sessions per week and four periods of content area sessions with the classroom teachers.  Students at the Emerging level receive two periods of pull out sessions per week and six content area sessions with the  classroom teachers.  Students at the Transitioning level receive two periods of ENL sessions and two periods of content area  lessons with ENL support. Students at the Emerging level receive four periods of content area lessons with ENL  support.  Commanding students receive two periods of content area lessons with ENL support.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      ENL program is delivered in English. These sessions  allow ENL instruction to address specific needs of ELLS and to use  supplemental materials and resources from the ENL classroom.  The students are free to use classroom materials that are  available in other languages.  There are picture cards, vocabulary cards, read aloud, vocabulary activities, charts, TPR, songs,  chants, small grouping, and partnering with other native speakers in order to make the lessons more accessible to the  students.  The use of co-planning with the classroom teachers also ensures that the content area adhere to not only the  students language development, but also to the Common Core Learning Standards.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Parents with students that are new to NYC school system receive a HLIS that is filled out in the interview process by a certified  pedagogue.  Once this is done, based on the parent responses, the students are given the NYSITELL.  If the student does not  receive a CM level , then then the students, if they are Spanish speaking would also take the NYSITELL in Spanish.  This is to  measure at what level they are in their native language. The students are evaluated in their home language through the use of  content area lessons such as social studies ,geography, and history.  The students can bring their native language through their  various projects and partner or small group work.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.   Long Term   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      e.   Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.  P.S. 146 currently have no SIFE students.    b.  P.S. 146 is an elementary school,  and most of our Newcomers ELLs are in the lower grades K-2.  Most of these students are  given ENL support  with their grade-level group at the appropriate levels indicated by NYSITELL or NYSESLAT data.  As  described in 2 and 3  above, ENL is delivered in push-in and pull-out sessions.  This ensures that the ENL instruction targets  their particular needs.  Newcomer ELLs in the lower grades who have had prior schooling, and have some literacy in their  home language are grouped together with Newcomer ELLs in the upper grades who are within 2 years of arrival.  This group is  taught basic vocabulary and survival English, as well as academic English and given native language support for instruction in  content areas.  Materials in the ENL classroom include computer workstations and multi-lingual library of fiction and non- fiction books, support Newcomer instruction.  Newcomers may be asked to read or write in their home language or  demonstrate understanding of material through a picture of a physical response.  Newcomer ELLs are given all possible  supports such as same curricula, intervention services, and supplemental instruction to prepare them for the NYSESLAT  test.  Newcomer ELLs who are within their first year and are in testing grades are not required to take the state ELA  exam.  They do have to take the State Math exam and if they are in fourth grade, the State Science exam.  These Newcomers  are provided with the appropriate testing materials and supplemental instruction such as extended day sessions that  emphasize reading and writing in these subjects in small group instruction.  They are also provided with testing  accommodations for these formal assessments, along with any native language testing materials.  c.  Developing students are provided with the ENL supports with their grade-level group at the appropriate level indicated on  the NYSESLAT.  As described in #3, ENL instruction is delivered in push-in and pull-out sessions, content areas are addressed, a  variety of ENL  researched based teaching methods are used, and data is used to target instruction.  d. There are no long-term ELLS at P.S. 146.    e.  Former ELLs are required to have two years of supplemental ENL services that consist of 90 minutes of instruction per  week.    They are also provided with two years of testing accommodations.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Students in self-contained Special Education classes, including ELL-SWDs, take part in the same curriculum as general  education students, and are offered all of the same materials and programs that are offered to general education  students.   These materials are RALLY, Ready Gen, Envision Math, guided reading materials, and Writing Pathways.  Special  Education classrooms teachers and the ENL teacher of ELL-SWDs use instructional strategies (e.g.. Chunking, content and  scaffolding) to support mastery of content area knowledge.  English language development is supported by ENL/SWD teaching  methods, including building word banks, working with graphic organizers, and explicit study of English grammar and writing  conventions.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  In order for our ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain their English proficiency, several instructional pieces are  used.  The first thing that is done in order for the students to achieve their goals is for the ENL teacher to not only read the ELL- SWDs IEP goals, but to utilize the entire IEP.  The IEP contains the strengths and weakness of each student, along with the type  of learner that student may be.  With this in mind, the ENL teacher then begins to construct instructional plans that will help  these students.  These instructional plans include the use of small group instruction, guided reading, visual aids, total physical  response, graphic organizers, vocabulary development, re-wording of instructions and the use of audio visual aids.  We also  utilize many online programs such as I-Read,  Reading A-Z, AIMSWEB, and Myon.  Out of classroom personnel such as SETTS for  at risk students, RTI services for students struggling in math provide help for these students as well.  Our ELL-SWDs in grades 3- 5 are included in our academic after school academy which focuses on reading skills, and mathematics.  All of these things  helps to ensure that our ELL-SWDs are able to achieve their IEP goals and attain their English proficiency.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      ELLs may participate in any appropriate targeted intervention program available to any other student at P.S. 146.  Since2010- 2011, the Response to Intervention instructional framework began and continues to provide interventions, and monitor  students' responses to those interventions with the use of the Passport and Ticket to Read programs.  The Envision math  programs had materials that are used to re teach and assess students to target any problem areas that need help.  The  Harcourt Science program has intervention and re teaching materials to assist the students using pictures, real world items,  and Smart board activities.  All students including ELLs, will be closely monitored by ongoing assessment, and students at risk  of poor outcomes will receive Tier II or Tier III interventions as needed.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      No new ELL-specific programs are planned for 2017-2018.  However, the school's continued development of its RTI model, and  enhancements to instruction using the Common Core Standards, continue to benefit all students, including ELLS.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   There are no bilingual program at P.S. 146x.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs have equal access to all school programs.  ELLs are fully integrated with non-ELLs in our school.  ELLs are placed in classes  with English proficient students, and provided with push-in and pull-out support.  Because ELLs are not segregated, they are  provided with all the materials that English proficient students get, and have equal access to all equipment, facilities, programs  and services.  There is no school program that is not available to ELLs.  ELLs have the same opportunities as English proficient  students to participate in supplemental programs.  P.S. 146 offers an After School program to all students in grades 3-5,  including ELLs.  Instruction in After School focuses on supporting students in ELA and Math. Also there is a specific after-school  program for grades 1 and 2 Ells for support on NYSESLAT.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   ELLs have the same curriculum as English proficient students (supplemented with push-in, pull-out).  Therefore , they are  provided with all of the instructional materials that are given to English proficient students.  P.S. 146 has a number of  instructional programs that include special supports for ELLs and were designed to address ELLs needs.  Envision Math (K-5)  includes Spanish language materials that we use with Spanish-speaking Newcomers ELLs.  SuccessMaker, a computer-based  literacy and math program that all grade 2-5 students use, also had Spanish-language components to support Newcomer ELLs  in learning content materials.  Reading for Real and Reading A-Z provides instructional strategies and activities to improve ELL's  reading comprehension and to practice independent reading strategies.  Every classroom in grades K-5 is equipped with an  interactive white board.  The school also has two full-size Technology Labs.  The lower-grade Technology Lab has 28 desktop  workstations where Pre-K-1 students (including ELLs) work primarily with the Waterford literacy and math programs.  The  upper-grade Technology Lab has 32 workstations, where grades 2-5 students(including ELLs) work with SuccessMaker and  various online tutoring and assessment tools.  The students can access the Internet for research and projects.  ELLs have full  access to all technological equipment in the school.  ELLs have extra resources in the ENL classroom.  There are three desktop  workstations.  The ELLs use the ENL classroom computers to access the Internet for research materials and to obtain materials  in English and their home language.  The ENL classroom provides many other resources for ELLs.  These include a large leveled  library of fiction and non-fiction trade books, including texts that address ELL needs, such as wordless books, repetitive and  cumulative texts, and phonic readers.  There are big books, reference books, and native language books, including  Spanish/English  and French/English dictionaries and glossaries, and Spanish and French fiction and non-fiction trade  books.  There is also a large collection of language learning tools and manipulative, such as picture cards, letter stamps, tiles,  word puzzles, language and math games,and regalia like play food and money.

Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents, including parents of ELLs are active at P.S. 146.  The ENL teacher is in constant contact with the parents in order to  provide them with not only information about their students, but to share the best ways in which they can help their students.  The parents are invited to four parent teacher conferences throughout the year.  There is an ELL parent meeting at the  beginning of the year so that the parents can talk to the ENL teacher about the NYSESLAT results and what the students will  need to focus on for the upcoming year.  The parents being aware of their students levels, strengths, weaknesses, are provided  with many different resources for their student to improve their language development.  The parents are made to feel that  they are in a partnership with the school community to help them with their student.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         2.
